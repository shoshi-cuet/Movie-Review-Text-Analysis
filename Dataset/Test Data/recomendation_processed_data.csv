2001: A Space Odyssey (1968),"2001 is a movie that stirs up polemical opinions . You almost certainly love it or hate with no one having an opinion that falls into the middle ground . Ironically enough I gave it 5/10 which indicates I thought this movie is average . I didn't think it was an average movie - I thought it was a pile of pretentious pseudo intellectual garbage and a cinematic update of the parable about the Emporers New ClothesWhat is there to enjoy about this movie narrative wise ? The first half hour is taken up with men in gorilla suits jumping around a studio exterior throwing bones about   a sort of chimps tea party on tranquilizers while the last half hour is taken up with a man pulling funny faces inside a psychedelic disco . Neither of these segments features dialogue so this is a movie that is impossible to follow story wise . And before anyone sends me a message to explain what 2001 is about let me tell you I'm not interested   and besides you're probably only kidding yourself if you think it's about anything . It's something to stare at after you've inhaled a joint   that's what its function is - Eye candy for the stoned Technically the movie deserves much credit since the cinematography is rather impressive as are all the aspects involving sound: mix   editing etc . The voice of HAL is very haunting and memorable and remained in this reviewer's head long after seeing 2001 and contributed to me not giving the movie a much lower mark . But it's still a movie that has a reputation that it doesn't deserve and is long   dull   pretentious and most of all unentertainingFive out of ten\t2001 is either confusingly profound or profoundly confusing. Either way  I suspect  what we have on screen is due largely to the massive  widespread drug-use of the swinging sixties when this was conceived.I'm not kidding. When Kubrick and Clarke sat and watched the star baby scene  in the final few frames of their film one can almost imagine the exchange:Kubrick: \Far out  man.\""Clarke: \""Dude...I'm seeing colours...\""etc.Drugs can maybe also explain Kurbick's infantile fascination with every spacecraft docking sequence  and why as a result we are forced to watch things unfold almost in realtime.For instance  when Dave pulls out the apparently faulty component. What amounts to probably one sentence in the script translates to five minutes plus of screen time. Is this effective? Necessary? Maybe  and maybe not.The film - as a whole and its individual sequences - are strangely hypnotic. If it was boring then I'd simply turn it off. It isn't. It's compelling in a way that I can't explain. Even completely superfluous and excessively long sequences somehow kept my attention. I suspect  with the aid of drugs they'd transcend \""compelling\"" and become enthralling.Make no mistake - gear's the reason 2001 exists. Not just Kubrick and the like  but the executives at MGM who greenlit this. Can you imagine some poor sod trying to pitch this to an executive today?\""Yeah  well  like  we start on earth with a load of apes who learn to beat each other around the head  then we jump to 2001 and this dude goes to the moon - takes him about forty minutes of our time but by God he gets there in the end. Then we jump to the Jupiter mission  a computer goes mad and then we get all psychedelic. Money please!\""Eh....I doubt it.\tThere is just no denying that this film has unbelievable scope. Like hundreds of other IMDb reviewers have said  the special effects are momentous. They have a hypnotic affect on you  not because they're exciting  they aren't  but for the reason that they are just so beautiful to watch.Whenever I view a film the first thing I want to know is when it was made and consequentially there after I can view it in it's proper context. I wasn't born in 1968 in fact it would be another 13 years before I would start my own Odyssey. If I would have seen it back then before man had been to the moon for instance or while the Cold War was raging  people were wondering if there WAS going to be a human race let alone what we would be like in the future. Nuclear Annihilation was a real possibility.... and then this film comes along. Something that people had never seen the likes of before. It must have been what many have said on these pages  'a real experience'. It is something that makes you stop and think  back then and now. I've just watched it recently after a number of years and there definitely is a enduring quality about it. The questions it raises are still pertinent today and it still looks fantastic. The thing that has changed is the way they make films nowadays and who they are designed for. I mean do you really think Kubrick sat back in his little directors chair on set and thought to himself 'this film is going to be great for 12 year-olds to go and see on a Saturday night...they can leave their brains at the door'. Of course not. This film will only interest people who expect to be challenged by film makers in what they watch. Sure you could re-cut the film and lose 3/4 of the running time and not miss anything important and technically it would be a better film. However that's not the point of this film. The narrative and plotting are irrelevant. It's the questions the film raises about humans  our origins  our future  our strengths and weaknesses that are the key driving themes of this picture. One of my favourite phrases I like to tell myself is this ; \""You can't tell where you're going until you know where you've been.\"" This film is a visual adventure through time and space. It does have its problems though.A lot of the sequences are vastly overindulgent. They are just last too long. You could watch this on DVD on x2 speed and it may be even better who knows. The pacing is a problem but nothing that would be fatal to the viewer. And you have to remember that in 1968 you are meant to be in awe of the space spectacle you are observing and therefore expected to lap up every second of it. After all  if you're doing something pioneering  why have a 10 second shot when you can have a 60 second one I say. It does grate on you severely from time to time though.Another disturbing aspect to proceedings is the characterisation. At times I felt like I had more empathy with the apes at the start of the film as they clubbed each other over the head compared to some of the supposedly 'evolved' humans we meet later on. They have no human features. They look human  they act human  they even sound human occasionally but I remain unconvinced. It frustrates me that you are meant to be telling the story of evolution of the human race and none of them seem to embody any of the qualities you usually attribute to us. Hal the ships computer had a better acting style and he was just a red light and a guy in a sound booth. And like I say the guys in the ape suits did a better job at the start then anyone else later on.I can totally understand why people don't like this film. Everyone wants something different from their cinema experience. Unfortunately most people who watch films nowadays seem to want all the questions not only answered but spoon fed to them in the process. 2001 does neither of these things. It just makes you think  a lot of people don't like doing that nowadays.Having said that  I myself wouldn't rate it highly on my personal list because I find it a bit contrived and self-indulgent. It also lacks any real flow or continuity. Also  for me a good film has to have characters I enjoy relating to. 2001 doesn't have them  it has good ideas and concepts but falls a little short in achieving them. I say again the visuals are superb  for the time and now. It just makes me strengthen by belief that CGI still can't offer the same realism and grounding a good miniature modal can. The better recent films marry CGI and miniatures however  too many solely rely on the power of their CPU chips for effects.I may not particularly like 2001 but I respect what it wanted to achieve and it definitely was a seminal motion picture. People who disregard it out of hand don't fully realise that without it there would be no films like Star Wars  Star Trek  to The Terminator etc.Science fiction for nearly 40 years now has had its cinematic roots firmly embedded within 2001: A Space Odyssey and for that this film will always have my firm respect and admiration if not my affection.\tThis is a classic film  that's amazing visually  with fantastic performances  however it's too slow for my liking. I really got into the film at times  however the pace is really inconsistent  and some of the dialog really bored me  plus it ended a little bit abruptly for me. The finale is absolutely spectacular  with some incredible jaw dropping special effects  and all the characters were fantastic  plus the visuals are amazing. The opening is very interesting  and the story while incredibly slow at times  is very good  plus HAL is extremely creepy!. Keir Dullea is simply amazing in this  and Stanley Kubrick's direction is masterful  plus the characters were all very interesting!. The Set pieces are amazing  and i was knocked out of my seat by the incredible special effects and visuals  plus the score was brilliant!. This is a classic film that's amazing visually  with fantastic performances however the pace was just to slow for my liking still it's a must see for any film fan  i just found the pace to be terribly inconsistent. The Direction is amazing for the most part!. Stanley Kubrick does an amazing job here  with incredible visuals  amazing camera work  jaw dropping angles  using incredible effects it's well written  however if only he kept the pace more consistent! it would have been perfect!. The Acting is fantastic!. Keir Dullea is AMAZING in here  he is extremely likable vulnerable  extremely convincing  his conflict with Hal was rather creepy  and was really intense amazing job!. Gary Lockwood and William Sylvester both do what they have to do very well and were both very likable!. Douglas Rain is amazing as the voice of HAL  he was extremely creepy and he shocked me at times. Rest of the cast are great. Overall this is a must see for every film fan  if only for the pace!. ****1/2 out of 5\tI have just watched 2001  eagerly I might say  as so many seem to think its great. I was genuinely bored  no\u0085.. I was actually mortified. It's so bad I cannot believe it was even made. The sheer mind numbing boredom made it difficult to sit through let alone understand  which is  of course not hard  as there is no decent plot whatsoever. It is truly awful and although I do agree with one guy that it is visually capable that is no reason to list it anywhere near the top of any list of films.Please save us from this sort of crap. Applauding it only makes it worse for the movie industry  as some idiots will want to make more like it. Just 'cos Kubrick has made some classics doesn't mean they all are. Clearly this is a case of movie industry sycophants patting each other on the back and thousands of mindless morons agreeing without actually thinking.Still\u0085\u0085\u0085 that's the movie industry!\tOn May 1st 1968  I attended the World Premier at the Casino Cinerama Theatre in Soho  London. It was for the Printers Pension Corporation. I still have the ticket and program. It was in Cinerama and was appx. 20 mins. longer than the version released in New York and now available. I believe the 20 mins. consisted of the hum-drum life on the ship which added greatly to the flavor of the picture. It was a true director's cut. For the life of me  I don't understand why MGM does not release it full length for sale and put it out in theaters that can handle Cinerama. I know I'd buy it and I know I'd go. It is a great mystery of cinema and MGM is really blowing it\t# 1 Best Film of 1968It's been thirty-seven years  but whenever I hear 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' by Richard Strauss playing on the radio  in a commercial  on television or in a movie  I always think of the illustrious motion picture  '2001: A Space Odyssey'. It was a film surrounding space travel and life in space in the future by one of the world's most celebrated filmmakers  Stanley Kubrick. '2001' was Stanley Kubrick's first big-budget film  his most memorable film and many film critics and movie buffs alike agree it's his most genius work. Part of the reason why '2001' was such a hit was because of the amazing special effects (for the time - it was 1968) and the haunting and brooding classical music score that blended perfectly into the peace and quiet of outer space. While wowing audiences with its spectacular visual effects  '2001' also challenged their intelligence and view on human life with deep philosophical ideas and messages lodged deep inside science-fiction picture. People have praised '2001: A Space Odyssey' as being the crowning work of an extraordinarily gifted filmmaker ahead of his time  and other have panned it as being jumbled  frustrating  deliberately confusing and very undeserving of it's praise. I have finally witnessed one of cinema's most talked about and debated over epics  and I can assure you it's not only an excellent movie  it's one of the best made motion pictures of all time  thanks entirely to the very meticulous and conscientious vision of Stanley Kubrick  the finest film director to ever grace the world.'2001: A Space Odyssey' is set in the beautiful and peaceful confides of outer space  where humans (mostly doctors and scientists) do astrological research from expansive spacecrafts. A lot of what we have today (and what we had when the book '2001' is based upon was written) has now been replaced with artificial intelligence (robots) in Stanley Kubrick's invisionment of what the year 2001 would look like  taken of course from Arthur Clarke's groundbreaking and controversial novel. The story surrounds two doctors on a mission up in space  Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). Their mission is leads them to the moon  to find an artificial relic  which can lead to the discovery to a new and mysterious life form. The two are helped by H.A.L.  the creepy-voiced computer of the spacecraft  who develops a mind of it's own and eventually turns on them. H.A.L. turns on the two astronauts when he (it  really) refuses to save them in fear it will jeopardize their mission. The film becomes a sort-of survival story after that for Dave (Frank dies  when he is failed to be saved by H.A.L.) which eventually leads him to what the mission is looking for  taking him on a five minute journey filled with vibrant and e colors and graphics through the depths of outer space  eventually resulting in Dave seeing himself aging and eventually dying  and being re-born as a extra-terrestrial. 2001's ending may be one of the most talked about  debated and argued about film endings of all time. There is no solid explanation for it  and Mr. Kubrick (as well as author Arthur Clarke) leave it up to you (the viewer) to figure out. I personally found the ending to be extremely frustrating and mind-numbing the first time I saw it. I just couldn't grasp it  until about four days later I began to deeply admire it. In my opinion  '2001' is very anti-technology (hinting it will one day destroy us)  but offers hope for us in the future. Stanley Kubrick provides the absolute best direction of his career with '2001: A Space Odyssey' that it is nothing short of appalling he didn't receive the Oscar for 'Best Director'. Without Kubrick  there couldn't have been a movie of '2001'  period. Only his rich  elaborate  sophisticated and undeniably gorgeous could make '2001' what it is then and today. In other words  if any other filmmaker was to touch it  the project would crash and burn. Kubrick fills the movie with aching beauty ever second of the runtime  not only with the direction but the screenplay he co-wrote with the famous novel's author  Arthur C. Clarke. The acting in '2001' is really nothing special  but it doesn't have to be because the last thing '2001' is about is the performances. Keir Dullea  Gary Lockwood  William Sylvester  Leonard Rossiter and Douglas Rain (who provides the chilling voice of the vengeful computer  H.A.L.) are all decent  but nothing really memorable (well  just Douglas Rain's voice). The film suffers by being a tad overlong  and it's also very slow moving in the beginning  but I forgive it for that. The film's cinematography  visual effects  musical score  set decoration  screenplay and sound were all Academy Award worthy  and in my opinion '2001' should have taken home the Oscar for 'Best Motion Picture of the Year'  but it wasn't even nominated. If that doesn't prove to you how short-sighted and ignorant the Academy voters are  I don't know what will!In conclusion  I don't even recommend '2001'. I plead  no I demand  you dash to your local videostore and rent a copy. You may enjoy it  you may not  but you will definitely be thinking about it the next morning and it will for sure enlighten you. '2001' isn't as much of a film as it is a landmark in cinema. '2001' set the bar for many extraordinary motion pictures to come  and I'll say it again  none of it would be possible without the genius of Mr. Stanley Kubrick. If you've already seen it  I recommend you buy it on DVD  along with Kubrick's other films in his DVD Collection including his work from 1962 to 1999. '2001' may bore you a little  but when it's all over it will give you a slightly different view on things. Grade: A-MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #85\tMost people probably know the story. One group of apes forces another away from a water hole. The other group then comes across the monolith  which seems to imbue them with a new ability. One of the apes realizes that he can use a bone as a weapon  and forces the other group away from the water hole. Millions of years later  a bunch of people on the moon discover the monolith  which has indeterminate effects on their equipment. Eighteen months later  supercomputer HAL tells astronaut Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) that there will be a failure. When the failure never happens  Dave and his co-astronaut Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) realize that HAL may be malfunctioning and get into a pod so that they can talk about disabling him. But HAL can read their lips  and begins plotting against them. He kills Poole  and so Dave quickly disables him. After coming across the monolith  Dave then goes through a time-space continuum  which ends with him seeing an elderly version of himself. The elderly version then sees an even older version. The older version sees the monolith  which then portrays a fetus  which seems to introduce a new stage of humanity.It goes without saying that \""2001: A Space Odyssey\"" is a thinking person's movie  but what is it saying? Knowing that insanity is a frequent theme in Stanley Kubrick's movies  let's address it here. We would jump to say that HAL is insane  but is he? He was programmed to complete the mission  and he would probably see fit to eliminate any perceived impediments. In Kubrick's \""Paths of Glory\""  the soldiers disobeyed orders because they knew that it would be insane to obey; HAL cannot disobey orders because he is just a series of chips  wires and electronic impulses. So in a way  the people who designed him were the insane ones.What about the humans-vs-machines issue? Dave is human and HAL is a machine  right? Well think about it. When Dave tries to retrieve Poole after HAL kills him  the claws almost look like they're cradling Poole  while Dave doesn't seem to express any emotion.As for relations to other Kubrick movies  technology is going out of control  like in \""Dr. Strangelove\""  and they are completely trapped  like in \""The Shining\"".\tRecently I viewed this movie again. Although the story becomes muddled starting with the Jupiter and beyond sequence  nevertheless the movie deserves praise for its special effects and its attempt to delve into the origins of man. And although the story has little action and sparse dialog  it nevertheless succeeds in engaging the audience's attention and maintaining a certain level of suspense  at least for the majority of the film. The problem is that the film ends not with a bang but with a thud. What starts off as being intriguing and at times almost sublime ends in a quagmire of uncertainty as the audience is left wondering what to make of the final scenes. Leaving the audience guessing is not a good way to end a movie and for that reason the movie can be characterized only as a qualified success. When I first saw this movie years ago  I was so intrigued by the music and special effects that I would have rated it a 10. But  alas  time marches on and so does my taste in movies. Recently I happened to watch this movie again and to my chagrin I found it BORING. What made the movie even more unpalatable was the pretentious and muddled story ... or message ... or cryptic allegory ... or whatever  that left me feeling profoundly annoyed. What the heck is this movie about anyway? I liked the beginning with the actors jumping around in monkey suits screaming at each and fighting and  well  acting a lot like people  but when the movie introduced the obelisk ... and then the space station ... and then the talking computer with an attitude ... and then the astronaut growing old ... and then a baby in a capsule looking at earth ... I knew that somewhere there was a message  but it was a message not received by me because frankly  my dear  I didn't give a hoot. The one character in the movie I liked  in fact the only character in the movie that is worthy of the term \""character \"" was the computer. If the movie had just been about the computer  and how well he ... or she ... or it ... sang \""Daisy \"" I might have liked this movie a lot more. This movie is an example of people getting in the way of a perfectly good story. Let the computer explore space. People have more important things to do.\t2001-A space Odessey  one of the very few spectacular films ever made  certainly a film most would never have thought was made in the 1960's  it's visual far forward special effects  make this film excellent throughout. I must admit  when I was a lot younger I did think the beginning of the film was too slow burning and accused it of being boring  but I have eaten those words and know better  especially with the poor trash that is being spewed out of Hollywood nowadays. I wonder whether the film courses guide/educate would be filmmakers to become filmmakers. Stanley Kubrick certainly had a good day when he came up with his gem 2001(a Space Odyssey)  which was certainly helped by the writing talents of Arthur.C.Clarke who went onto present the Unexplained/Mysterious World programmes in 1970's and early 80's. The leading characters Keir Dulea and Gary Lockwood and the ship's computer\""HAL\"" 9000 series really gelled the film together with it's claustrophobic climax. It was also a surprise to see a cameo role with \""Rigsby\""(Leonard Rossiter)though he was better at comedy than serious acting in my view. Although we now know the future hasn't moved that far forward in time as suggested in 2001  it's nice to think that the future may have looked something like 2001. Splendid spectacular and well ahead of it's time.........EXCELLENT! YOOF! Corporation\t2001 is the supreme example of the lost art of pure cinema. Alongside other auteurs like David Lean  Kubrick represents a period of epic film-making that has sadly passed from our realm. The indelible experience of a theatrical motion picture event such as 2001 has been replaced in our time with forgettable multiplex fodder--even \""event\"" films such as Spielberg's War of the Worlds are nothing more than forgettable popcorn time-fillers. But 2001 was crafted to leave a lasting impression of complex  majestic artistry  sewing seeds of mystery and dream-world surrealism that  for me at least  live on in my own consciousness.Those who've never viewed 2001 in its proper setting have never really seen the whole film. I have the DVD  but rarely enjoy viewing it. The home video format simply eradicates the grandeur and majestic scope of this completely unique cinematic milestone. The last chance I had to view it on a big screen was at the Cineramadome in Hollywood about a decade ago  and that experience was memorable beyond words. Inherent in its makeup  2001 was meant to be viewed in crystal-clear 70mm on a mammoth screen  with state-of-the-art sound. Through its sensory scope  the technology of the film itself suggests the evolutionary connections between the futuristic HAL and the very medium chosen to portray him/it. The movie screen becomes a character in the relationships posed by 2001  and no video system can ever duplicate that. The incredibly complex  layered sound (as well as the suffocating silence) is also a character. That's the nature of Kubrick's visionary cinema.Such were the ideas and ideals of film-making as it blossomed in the sixties era  conceptual strains which are all but lost in our current corporation-saturated world. It was years after having seen 2001 as a young teenager that I was able to see Kubrick's complete body of work  and it's still striking that an artist who was so cynical could have made the great masterpiece of awe and wonder. The companion piece to 2001  A Clockwork Orange  is in many ways the antithesis of all that 2001 conveys  and to me that's a fascinating dichotomy. I think the latter film was closer to Kubrick's own world-view  but as an artist and a master of visions  2001 stands as the supreme testament to thinking outside the box.\t\""200l: A Space Odyssey\"" is a supremely intriguing space-travel journey with a profound look at mankind's future... It is one of the very few great films of our times... It gives us something to think  talk and argue... It wonders about our importance in the universe and ignites our imagination and curiosity... It inspires us to dig for insights...As a science fiction fantasy  it is one of the most original films ever made... Kubrick's camera dances to the \""Blue Danube\"" with planets floating exuberantly through the light years... It's an experience in the poetry of motion  a rich statement to the power of cinema...But \""2001\"" reveals that it's not really a science fiction film after all... It's  instead  a philosophical enigma  a magnificent meditation on man's place in the grand scheme of things  and a quest to understand ourselves by knowing all else...\""2001\"" is a unique film about man's evolution told in almost subliminal terms... The people in this classic science-fiction epic hardly matter... Kubrick relates a chronology in images of things\u0097the mountains  the desert  the technology  the space capsule  the computer named HAL (who is more interesting than the humans)  and the time warp... The final landing scene is the very hallmark of cinematic genius...As a terror story  too  it is a towering achievement (not on the same scream-inducing level as Hitchcock's \""Psycho\"")  but in an innocent and far more haunting way...The film uses invisible but powerful forces to manipulate the plot but perhaps the most overwhelming one is the picture's vision of man... In Kubrick's fantasy  the Golden Age of man was a neglected instant between a man-ape's exaltation at discovering the first weapon and a nuclear-powered spaceship floating in a graceful orbit around the Earth... Man has indeed evolved!As a spectacle \""2001\"" assaults the mind  eye and ear  with stimulating images and suggestions... We are surrounded by a totally believable futuristic environment... The film is filled with brilliant sequences and extraordinary moments: The first interesting minutes in which the story of the apes is told visually  without a single line of dialog; the zero-gravity toilet with its great list of instructions; the stewardess defying gravity by walking the walls calmly upside down; the frightening moment when we realize that HAL is reading the astronauts lips; the magical alignments of Sun  Moon  and Earth; the \""Starchild\"" returning home to charm the orb...\""2001\"" is filled with poetic imagery: the view of the Sun rising over the Earth; the tossing of the bone into the air in slow motion; the slow images of the giant spaceship revolving in a cosmic ballet...\""2001\"" is also a work of great visual acuity... It allows us to view more than the mystery of existence and destiny implicit in every man... Its end troubles many viewers as they demand clarity where there can only be mystery... They insist upon an answer where there can only be a question... Every viewer had a different explanation of the mysterious end of Kubrick's film\u0085 But for those who can accept mysticism  the climax is deeply moving...\tExtremely complex and not very accessible SF adventure that ever since its premiere in 1968 has been the study of film students and buffs alike. Even if you have seen the movie several times it remains one of the most fascinating and fresh films of all time  and you can always find new details  that you did not see the first time around. I really don't consider it a real movie as such; it's lacking a genuine narrative and the story get's lost in the overall message of man and machine in space and so on and so forth. But it's a voyage in a sort of conciseness that transcends the story (and the genre!) and culminating in that strangest of endings ever in a SF-movie. A unique film  no doubt one of the most important Kubrick ever made.\tI think this movie is the greatest Sci-Fi movie ever made. Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest directors ever too. This movie has wonderful visual effects you just have to compare this effects with Star Wars(George Lucas - 1977) and see the big difference between this movie and Star Wars.(This is movie is 10 ten years older than Star Wars!!!) Of course i know that Star Wars is just a popular movie.(It ranked 7th in the funny IMDb top 250!!!) It has a great philosophical message about life and about domination of computer on human.(Great Kubrick...he understood this 40 years ago.) You just think that the movie has great visual effects+great classic music+great philosophical message = Perfect 10/10!!!\t2001: A Space Odyssey.Stanley Kubrick has left his mark in cinema with a wide selection of masterpieces  both big and small. Whilst not on his most controversial list  2001: A Space Odyssey  must be his most thought provoking story of man and his tools. With the exception of a few scenes  this film in my books is more an artistic composure of space; as an example  to spend three  four  even five minutes watching a ship docking on a space station would seem all too slow  boring and even dull  but Kubrick  and his genius film making techniques made it a thing of art.Up until this films release  all films both action and not would have spent 95% of screen time pushing the st"
A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004),"Dear Reader  This movie fulled my heart with woe and joy at the same time it was so brilliant. the Baudelaire orphans  Violet  Klaus and Sunny  seem to be destined for misery and woe for the despicable Count Olaf is on there tail every moment of this movie and trying  as I am sure you have guessed  to kill them. (why you ask? because the children inherit a large sum of money after they're parents die in a fire) it is indeed unfortunate for them when poor Violet Baudelaire is forced to marry the despicable Count Olaf. but in the end of coarse the good guys  in this case Violet  Klaus and Sunny  win and Count Olaf is locked away! oh how I wish this was so... but very unfortunately Count Olaf escapes the polices clutches and is off some where planing his next attempt at stealing the Baudelaire Fourtune no doubt! With all due respect  Tetki-Chan.\tWhen Klaus  Violet and Sunny Baudelaire loose their parents in a fire in their mansion  the greedy and evil Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) tries to become their guardian to steal their fortune.This movie is a great family entertainment. Jim Carrey is amazing in the role of Count Olaf  in my opinion  the villain of the year. The screenplay of this story of orphans is very original; the make-up of Jim Carrey is spectacular; the very dark cinematography recalls the movies of Tim Burton; the direction is great and the children have excellent performances. There is a light message that children are never listened  no matter whether they have reason or not. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \Desventuras em S\u00e9rie\"" (\""Unfortunate Events in Series\"")\tThis is a film I almost didn't see. After the ridiculous maketing bonanza that surrounded this film's arrival  I had no desire to see it. There were Lemony Snicket's drinks  Lunchables  Happy Meal Toys  regular toys  and so on. It disgusted me. Now  many months later  I caved in to see it at the local second-run theater (Bless it) and I had one heck of a good time. \""Lemony Snicket's \""A Series of Unfortunate Events\""\"" is a surprisingly great film! The film is told from the perspective of Lemony Snicket  a journalist assigned to chronicle the unfortunate lives of Violet  Klaus  and Sunny Baudelaire. The three children were orphaned by a mysterious fire and immediately sent to live with Count Olaf  who is either their third cousin four times removed or their fourth cousin three times removed. Whatever the relation  Olaf is as bad a guardian as he is an actor (he's notorious around town as the worst actor anyone has ever seen). Olaf plans to kill the children and take the family fortune  unaware of the legal loopholes that prevent such a plan from working.The kids use their talents to overcome Olaf's dastardly plots. Violet is an inventor  Klaus is a know-it-all book worm  and Sunny is a teething infant with a strong bite. Together  their talents allow them to overcome anything.Jim Carrey makes Olaf one of the most flamboyantly evil villains of recent years  and one of the most fun. Liam Aiken  Emily Browning  and Kara and Shelby Hoffman as the three Baudeliare kids are superb. Aiken and Browning give mature performances  and the Hoffman twins are hilarious as the biting baby. Meryl Streep turns in a funny performance as Aunt Josephine  who is afraid of being killed by her every earthly possession.While it is uneven in spots  \""Lemony Snicket's\"" is undoubtedly fun. This is a unique film with a great sense of style and fantasy and featuring great performances all around from it's cast. It's weird and funny and worth your time.\tThe only reason I decided to rent this movie is because my friend knows Emily Browning (Violet) and told me it wasn't a bad movie. I had read the books and was curious about the movie. So I rented it and found it to be a very good and entertaining film. Jim Carrey was awesome as always and Dustin Hoffman (at least I think it was him) made a short appearance too. All in all  it wasn't a bad movie  although I wouldn't compare it Harry Potter as some people have.I really hope they make a second follow-up movie to it doing books four  five  and six. I believe it has definitely earned that. If you want a new kind of movie to see with your kids or family  I recommend this one. Hope you e\tHaving reached the age of 18 I  truth be told  didn't have very high expectations regarding this film. Trailers and clips really had me convinced that I had outgrown this movie with a couple of years. Deadly mistaken thar' \""sunny\""... This film really captured me  and tingled every movie-related sensation in me: Joy  amusement  curiosity and sorrow. Having not read the book(s) most definitely gave me an edge as opposing to those of you who have in fact read it/them. You may call it untrue to its written predecessors  but I simply find it mind consuming and extremely entertaining. As for the cast  well anyone in his or her right mind will agree that Jim Carrey was phenomenal. That meaning both hilarious and devious. Bill Connolly also did a great job  whilst I admittedly would've loved a few more spiffy remarks from Cedric the Entertainer. Original  devilishly well-animated  brilliantly casted and very well told. I suppose the plot may have had a few holes in comparisons the the book(s)  but seeing as I before watching this visual beaut. knew absolutely bupkiss about motive  characters and so on  very few elements are marked as downsides in my book.\tWhen \""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events\"" begins  we are introduced to a cute little elf. Then  Lemony Snicket (Jude Law) explains that this movie is not about elves; if you are looking for a \""cute\"" movie  then avoid this movie at all costs. You see  the Beaudelaire children have just lost their parents in a horrible accident  and they are handed over to leery Count Olof (Jim Carrey). Count Olof proceeds to do everything possible to kill the children  no matter where they go.Jim Carrey sure has come a long way from that goof-ball who butt-talked in the \""Ace Ventura\"" movies. He played a dark character in \""The Cable Guy\""  but this brings comically dark characters to a whole new level. They never say where the movie happens; it's like an alternate reality  in which a metropolis  the coast  and farmland are within a small radius. This only adds to the occult factor. Good support comes from Meryl Streep as mousy Aunt Josephine  Timothy Spall as oblivious Mr. Poe  and Catherine O'Hara as corrupt Justice Strauss. You will never think the same way about children stories after watching this movie.\tThis was a bad movie for thoes who read the book and thoes who haven't. For thoes who read the book: It seemed to me that they took only parts from the book scrambled them and put it horribly together  adding things that people (including me) haven't even found out after reading the second to last book. They ruined the book and destroyed the perfectally thought out characters. Also  my 7 year old cousin who read the books didn't even like it. For thoes who didn't read the book: My 5 year old cousin hated the movie  yes there were funny parts which is why I gave it a 2  he did laugh at some parts  but what he had heard about the book he said didn't fit with the movie and said the movie was boring. It was just silly with no plot. More of a bunch of funny lines put together with parts from the movie  put together with STUPID!!!\tI am a great fan of \""Lemony Snicket\""'s work  and I wasn't disappointed by the movie. True   it may lack some of the menace and dark sarcasm of the books  but Brad Silberling still manages to capture the humour of them. Jim Carrey was brilliant as the villainous Count Olaf  and the children portrayed their characters well. Billy Connolly may have been slightly bland as Uncly Monty  but Meryl Streep perfectly depicted the nervous  high-strung Aunt Josphine. I really enjoyed the music of this film  along with Sunny Baudelaire's sarcastic comments in baby-talk  subtitled at the bottom of the screen. And finally  the credits: they perhaps captured the darker feel of the books most of all  with their superb artwork and as mentioned before  a spectacular soundtrack.\tSo I ended up watching the movie just because Liam Aiken & Jim Carrey were in and I really ended up liking it  so when it came out I bought it. I rarely buy movies but this is a movie I can watch over and over again  its just THAT cute. Personally  I hate the books. I think they are amazingly boring and are waay to detailed  just my opinion  but I cant really think of what drove me to see the movie other then my friends saying it was adorable  and they were right. I enjoyed the movie very much in my home town theater with my Mom  my Mom didn't like it  but everyone is to their own opinion. I think Jim Carrey did a fantastic job as Count Olaf  I think he was perfect and extremely funny for the role of count Olaf. Liam Aiken was absolutely perfect as Klaus  as was Emily Browning for Violet. But even better  was Jude law for the voice of Lemony Snicket. Overall  this was a great movie and recommend it! Thank you for reading  Krista\tI just recently saw this movie. I had hopes for this movie. I really wanted to like it  i really did. But this movie is crap. Boring and sluggish  Jim seems tired of the role  even before he's done playing it. The movie moves at a snails pace  and the baby ruined the movie. The best footage of the movie is(most) of the deleted scenes and outtakes (on the DVD). If the stupid baby & over half of the boring in-movie footage was deleted and replaced with the deleted and alternate stuff  it could be a winner. As it is  the movie should be titled: 'A series of unfortunate editing events'. Movie rating: 1 out of 10. DVD Deleted footage and outtakes rating: 8 out of 10.\tI am an \""outsider\"" in that I have not read the books  so my comments apply to this as a stand-alone movie.To be fair  the DVD cover did warn that this is an unpleasant movie. And they were not exaggerating. What a miserable story - someone trying to kill three children so he can get his hands on their money.Carrey can be absolutely brilliant  but in this case he is completely overwhelming  and quite frankly once one has seen 10 minutes of his performance  the prospect of having to face another hour or so was more than I could bear.The movie was unrelentingly depressing and heavy  with nothing to lighten it with no whimsy. The children were (realistically) passive participants in their circumstances  in counterpoint to Carrey's overacted but single-dimensional character. Coming from a country in which child abuse  domestic violence  murder and poverty are horribly present  I felt that this movie treated crimes against children too lightly by making the perpetrator to be an object of fiction  instead of the very ordinary (but sick) people they are.On the positive side  the sets  camera work and costumes were exceptionally good.\tThis is a very good movie. It was just very awful. Jim Carrey's character is a terrible person. I really did not like him  in this movie  even though he does an excellent Count Olaf. You get to follow three children's terrifying search for someone who can take care of them. You get to see how the three children try to run  but has nowhere to hide. The children has a very frightening destiny  which you pretty much understand from the very beginning  because of the colors of the movie. There's a story-teller throughout the movie  who you never really get to see  which I think is good  because it makes him more mysterious. Have you not yet seen this movie  see it! That's my advice.\tAt best lame and disturbing. At worst a waist of 107 minutes.If this is the best that can be done to attempt to turn a book to film  give up now.The standard of acting was good  the best performance was that of the actor playing the baby  sunny.I was particularly disappointed by Carrey as he simply played Carrey and nothing more.The whole concept seemed a feeble attempt at emulating the Potter movies and failed.Please do not attempt to follow this with another embarrassing flop.\tI remember walking past the movie display for this flick before it was released. The name made me do a double take. Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events? What the hell? It seemed so odd and mysterious and unique. The movie itself? Not as much. But still better than every Harry Potter movie I've ever seen. The Potter books remind me a lot of Lemony Snicket ones.Jim Carrey is good as the evil Count Olaf. But as in most of his performances he suffers from Jim Carrey Syndrome. That is like Robin Williams  Samuel L. Jackson  Jack Nicholson  and Woody Allen  he isn't playing a character. He's playing Jim Carrey  just like Jack plays Jack and Sam plays Sam  and Robin plays Robin and Woody plays Woody. Jim is doing his usual stand-up routine here. The odd Jim Carrey-esquire voices and facial expressions. The bit where Olaf does his dinosaur impression from his acting troupe should have been left on the cutting room floor. That is NOT Olaf. That's a Jim Carrey stand-up routine. It's an amusing bit  I guess. But it detracts from the purity of the Snicket novels and the Olaf character. Perhaps Johnny Depp or Gary Oldman would have been a better casting choice.The story is the tale of the Baudelaire (love that name!) orphans and their psychotic relative Count Olaf trying to bump them off so he can claim their inheritance. The Baudelaire children are perfectly cast  all of them Claus  Violet and Sunny. And this is coming from someone who doesn't like children.Director Brad Silberling does a bang up job along with his set designer showing us beautiful and bleak looking sets. One of the things I like most about the film is its emptiness. That is  the Baudelaires live in world devoid of people. Or a lot people anyway. That would seem to be the ideal childhood. Very few other people around. And being schooled at home by your parents or people hired to raise you. No bullies  no school cliques  no inane peer pressure of fascistic state schooling to turn you into a mindless  left wing or right wing government schooled drone. People are like liquor  all right in small amounts  but too much will ruin your life and make you puke your guts out.The screenplay could have been better and doesn't always capture the magic of the books. And Meryl Streep seems a bit out of place in her role  I found her annoying and wanted her to die. While Billy Connolly was a fine fit for his part (as much as I hate snakes). If you are a fan of dark children's stories that remind one of the Brother's Grimm stories  A Series Of Unfortunate Events is the imperfect modern day Grimm's fairy tale for you.\tFrom my point of view  this movie is a ten  but not all people enjoyed it as much as i have and do. I know some people who think this movie is the worst movie ever  well  ever since titanic. They say it is no good because it is nothing like the books. Sure the Marvelouse Marriage was supposed to be with the first book. I don't think that at all. I think Brad Silberling is a great director  and his decision to put that at the end of the movie and not near the beginning with the first book was a great idea. And Klaus saving Sunny. I hear people slaying that Violet was supposed to save her  and i always respond to them: \"" How could Violet save Sunny if she was acting at the time. If she had left Sunny would ave died.\""Or in Count Olafs words  FFFFWWWWWOOOOO CCCLLLLAAANNNGGGG PPPHHHHFFF EEEEEEEEE! I disagree with these people and I just think that nobody else could have done this movie better than Brad Silberling did.\tFirst  about the acting. Well  I think Jim Carrey is too funny. When I was reading the book  I count Olaf in the film must be cruel and very bad-tempered. *But*  *but*  *but*  Jim Carrey is too funny  not cruel like I always imagine Count Olaf. The book is not really comic (I know  sometimes  there are some details that can help the audiences distress). I was not expecting a comedy. But  after all  the acting is OK  particularly (don't laugh) Sunny. Liam Aiken and Emily Browning is just OK. Their acting has nothing to comment about. And I think their acting is really bad at the scene where the Baudelaire heard about the death of their parents and went back to their house which is completely destroyed.Secondly  and this is what I dislike the most about the film  is the adaptation. This is not what I was expecting. What? It was lacking of so many important detail that make the film become so boring and I felt nearly asleep in the middle of the film. I know  they have to cut some part of the film becos' the film is going to be too long. But they don't even know how to cut  they cut some most important details. For example  why they didn't keep the part when the Baudelaire find out how Count Olaf killed Uncle Monty  disguise and hide the tattoo? I feel really unpleasant while watching the film.So  I highly don't recommend you this film if you have read the book. Don't think that the book is good that the film will be perfect. And by the way  sorry for my English  I'm not professional\t\""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events\"" - a creepy  cringe-inducing hunk of pseudo-Dickensian whimsy - proves  once and for all  that they just don't make good old-fashioned Victorian melodramas the way they used to. Technically speaking  the film isn't actually set in the Victorian Era but rather in a never-never land in which 19th century fashions clash with late 20th Century technology. And  indeed  it is the unique look of the film - achieved through extraordinary art direction and brilliant production and costume design - that is the one element of quality in the movie.The plot is vintage Dickens: three adorable and resourceful youngsters  Violet  Klaus and Sunny  find themselves unexpectedly homeless and orphaned when a mysterious fire kills their parents and incinerates their house. With no last will and testament specifying who is to raise them  the children are carted off to a distant \""relative\"" by the name of Mr. Olof  a creepy  sadistic eccentric who lives in a ramshackle mansion across town and hates children with a seething passion. He also plays host to a troupe of ghoulish cretins (ostensibly fellow actors) who look like punk rock rejects from the dance clubs down in Soho. In no time flat  Mr. Olof has turned the three youngsters into his own personal slaves. He even goes so far as to try to rub them out on the notion that he will then inherit their parents' money. The plot involves the children repeatedly escaping from Olof's diabolical clutches into the protective arms of other \""relatives \"" only to have him show up in various disguises  knock off the competition  and re-establish his primacy over the hapless trio.Although ostensibly a comedy  \""Lemony Snicket's\"" is  in actuality  an extremely dark  depressing movie  definitely not appropriate for young children  but even adults will be made uncomfortable by its obsessive emphasis on cynicism  sadism and death. The movie reaches its nadir in a truly queasy scene in which the middle-aged Olof attempts to marry his 14 year-old ward as a means of inheriting the money. This is supposed to be funny? Beyond that  the movie is boring and episodic  with little narrative thrust to hold the disparate and repetitive \""events\"" (we'll agree that they are quite \""unfortunate\"") together.Normally a big fan of Jim Carrey  I found his performance in this film to be repulsive and unwatchable  a new career low for him (well  his Grinch comes pretty close). Even the normally can-do-no-wrong Meryl Streep falls victim to this film.One can only imagine what a master artist like Dickens would have done with this material  how he would have imbued it with wit and heart and a strong statement about human relationships and societal values. \""Lemony Snickets\"" could have been an imaginative  delightful story about a crazy but engaging old codger who brings magic and fun into the lives of three hurting children. Instead  it's a dismal tale of a twisted old psychopath who spends two hours killing innocent people and terrorizing youngsters with the same fate if they don't do everything he tells them to. I honestly can't imagine what audience these movie makers thought they were appealing to with this movie.If this film  heaven help us  ever spawns a rash of sequels  we'll have to change the title to \""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Movies.\""\tSaw this film on DVD not ever liking the look of it  i had seen many advertisements  trailers  posters you name it on this film and it had never really been a film i had thought of going to see.Yet when my 6 year old sister managed to get the DVD i had really no choice but to sit and watch what i though was going to be another childish film  with children frolicking and playing around. And when the film started what i thought were my worst fears were already starting. I mean that happy little elf really does give you the wrong idea  and then the screeching sound like the end of a tape playing at the end of the little elf part. And all i remember after that sound was watching one of the best films this summer.Jim Carrey was awesome  you cannot fault him at all in this film  well you cant fault him in many of his films. Its just so good to see someone who cant act amazingly well and yet change their face so many times in one film that a some points you forget its Carrey. He played his part awesomely  and he did really overdo his part but i actually think that Count Olaf needed to be overdone  i mean one of my funniest scenes was when he had his acting party round and they were all asleep  then you suddenly hear  'LETS go back to prehistoric times when dinosaurs ruled the earth' lol that was funny his actions were hilarious. but not just that scene every scene he seemed to do it ended in a laugh.Even the 3 little children were great  Violet whom I've only seen in Ghost ship did a remarkable job  she is an upcoming star i think  and then there's Clause who i would much rather like to see in a part such as Harry potter  just by seeing him in this film. He like the other 2 really did a grade A job at acting.The actual story was at times confusing  but even so it really was greatly directed and put together.So please whether you've read the books or not this film is awesome and should be watched by one and all  young and old. It really is a joy to watch!!!\tThe idea of making the series of unfortunate events into a film was a good one.One that was faithful to the books  but honestly at the same time I'm also thinking this was defiantly NOT really faithful to the series for me the movie sort of ruined the books.Count Olaf is supposed to be a creepy and threatening villain correct me if I'm wrong but Jim Carry made him into a goofy and silly character.The filmmakers should have gotten a more serious intense and dark actor with a little bit of humor at the same time which was displayed in the original books.The production design was a little too over the top as well.Parts of it reminded me a bit of a gloomy setting of the cat and the hat or the new Grinch who stole Christmas.All I'm really trying to say is that they took a smart and wonderful series of books and personally changed it into a goofy movie.But i'll give it a few stars for trying.I's not TERRIBLE but it's not great either.\tI saw this blind  having only seen the trailer a couple of times almost a year ago. I was hard-pushed for a film to buy  so I got this.The most gorgeous film I have witnessed in some months. While there are many  many things to admire and enjoy in this film  the most striking aspect is the sumptuous production design and virtually seamless effects work. Every shot is crafted delicately and acutely to perfection and  without having read any of the Lemony Snicket books  you get a tangible sense of the Gothic grandeur which they undoubtedly contain. The design lends the film a very Burton-esquire air  though I fear that is selling the film short  as director Brad Silberling is becoming more confident with each film  defining his own niche in cinema. With his previous films Casper  City of Angels  Moonlight Mile and now this  his work holds together as musings on the impact of death on the living and  having dealt with a loved one's death himself  he is carving an auteur's body of work  balancing adult material and family films expertly.While there is indeed plenty for children to enjoy  not least Carrey's manic and hilarious performance(s) and the overall sense of awe  in many ways it is a children's film for adults  much in the same vein as Roald Dahl's books were bedtime stories adults would enjoy reading and indeed revisiting. This is aided by the uniformly wonderful and offbeat performances of all involved. Carrey  of course  is perfect as Olaf  hamming it up delightfully yet believing he is the world's finest actor. If I had one complaint  it would be that we simply don't see enough of his creations - I was enjoying his one-legged sea captain immensely  but he wasn't on screen long enough. The Baudelaire children are excellent  without a trace of mawkishness or Jake Lloyd-like discomfort. Emily Browning is surely set to become one of Hollywood's most beautiful young actresses and  unlike most of her peers  has talent to back up her looks. Liam Aiken also has a bright future ahead of him  holding his own against a stellar cast.And what a cast  full of famous and familiar faces  from mega-stars - the always reliable Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman - through well-known character actors such as Timothy Spall  Billy Connolly and Luis Guzman  to the cultish faves of Catherine O'Hara  Jennifer Coolidge and Jane Adams. The cast is every bit as finely picked as those of the Harry Potter films  though frankly I would rather sit through one of these each year.While the story is by its nature episodic - the Lemony Snicket novels are very short and this film comprises three of them  each contributing about a half hour of screen time - events move at a fair pace and there is never any boredom thanks to the inventive  witty  often hilarious script. Add to this an interesting and very enjoyable score and some grand set pieces  as well as a mystery running through the film  and this is ideal family fare of the highest order. A sequel would be most welcome  though it seems doubtful at this stage whether we will receive one.Extra mention must be made of the credits and DVD. The end credits surpass even the recent Catch Me If You Can for inventiveness and sheer enjoyment  rounding off the tone of the film and the fantastic world it sets out for itself. You will find yourself watching right til the end of the main credits  just for the gorgeous animation. And for the 2-disc DVD  Dreamworks obviously set out to put Warners' Potter discs to shame  cramming them with pretty much anything you could want to know about the film - including a pair of very good commentaries and hours worth of making of material  highlights being the Jim Carrey featurette and the pieces on making an artificial version of Sunny  the baby. A must for die-hard DVD aficionados and first-rate viewing for the family."""
Alexander (2004),"The story of Alexander the Great's(Colin Farrell) journey across the east  conquering everything in his path. The movie also stars Angelina Jolie  Val Kilmer  Anthony Hopkins  and Rosario Dawson.Although the All-Star cast  the epic story  and the great director  the movie was not any better than average. It could not compare to any similar great historical stories such as Gladiator or Braveheart. The movie was meant to be biographical but focused way too much on the theory that he was homosexuality. It explained very little on his conquests but did a very good job on his childhood(Although Val Kilmer played Colin Farrell's dad). Overall  the movie was very disappointing to me  considering Olvier Stone is a personal favorite and the story of Alexander the Great is also a favorite of mine.I do not recommend this movie.\tSome people speak of how this movie portrays Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion  and how many people dislike the focus on a homosexual relationship in the movie. Commonly  these comments include an assessment that the values in Alexander's day were far different from the values of our day. This is true. The homosexual relationship that existed between Alexander and Hephaestion  however  would not have been the same as a homosexual relationship today. This is one of the movie's great failings. Alexander and Hephaestion are portrayed in a manner more befitting characters on Will and Grace than as the warriors that they were. Apparently  for Oliver Stone  if someone has sex with a man that person will act like a girl.The movie also fails in portraying a commander that could actually inspire soldiers. Alexander cries in front of his men. He begs them instead of commanding them. There is nothing in the character portrayed in the movie that would cause a man to follow him for years on end. The man who would cut the Gordian knot is nowhere to be found in this movie. I guess it's fortunate that that story isn't in the movie.The movie also suffers in an area that could have made it at least mildly entertaining. The huge battle scenes utilize a \shaky camera\"" method to make things seem violent and exciting. The result is that it is next to impossible to make out what exactly is going on in the battles. They also serve to further display Alexander's apparent impotence. No brilliant tactical maneuvers are shown. Alexander also lacks the ability to actually hit an opponent with a thrown weapon. At the end of the movie  Ptolemy reflects on Alexander's greatness. I couldn't find anything great about Alexander. This is quite perturbing for me. Alexander the Great is my favorite historical figure. I was thrilled to find out that a movie about his life was being made. Imagine my disappointment to find nothing of that person in the movie. Oh. Wait. Yeah. He had sex with men. When that became the most important part of his story... I don't know.\tI give it a star for the Battle of Gaugamela and a star for the scenery. The rest of the movie sucked. I couldn't believe how slow it was. Just about nothing happened from Gaugamela to the end. It was incredibly long and as boring as anything could be. The fake accent by Angelina Jolie was appalling and stupid as heck. The worst part of the movie were the narrations by Anthony Hopkins. He explained all the parts of the movie that were too hard to act out on screen  because Oliver Stone wanted to fill up most of the movie with mindless disputes between Alexander and his men. I mean  the whole point of a movie is that you are told the story visually. But in this movie  you see a bunch of guys riding around on horses as Hopkins explains what is happening.A little inaccuracy that just about made me gag from idiocy was in the last battle when that guy gets impaled on the elephant's tusk. Come on! Like that would ever happen. You know how dull those are. That part ruined any emotion I would have felt during the last battle.THIS MOVIE SUCKED!!!\tI really mean it. The story of Alexander the Great is an interesting one to be told. Also  I tend to like movies from the antiquity. My favourite movie  \""The Gladiator\""  got me into it. Even though \""Troy\"" disappointed me  I still had hopes for this one  but it tended to be worse in every aspect. Where \""Troy\"" still was a mediocre movie  \""Alexander\"" sucks on every level. First of all  the action-sequences in movies like this are important. I don't know exactly what it was  but the action in this movie didn't excite me one bit. It was rather dull and uninteresting. One scene in India is rather OK  but that's it. The story is also VERY boring. I know that this is a true story and all  but it actually is possible to make it more exciting. And what about the \""boys wanna be with boys\""-suggestions considering Alexander? That should've been completely removed from the movie. I fully understand that this movie was banned in Greece. Who want their national hero turned in to a rather tragic  femi-like idiot? None. And the actors portraying Alexander and his mother are nearly at the same age. Give me a break  people.\tAlexander is portrayed as heavily homosexual in this movie  somewhat tainting the image of him as a great warrior. Many thematic elements evidence a flamboyance that detracts from the general mood  generating facades that don't match. Such as the helmet that showed a closer resemblance to a head dress than a piece of armor  and music that was more fitting for a frolic in the flowers  than for a conqueror marching victorious. The bizarre twist of feminine beauty that is attributed to such a bloody and ugly thing as war  bloodshed  and dismemberment makes the movie seem heterogeneous  and many parts from the musical score and costumes to the camera work seem out of place. I have never encountered the perception of Alexander as gay in any of my experiences with Greek history  and for such an opinion to erect itself so suddenly leads me to question its historical accuracy.\tAlexander is one of the greatest movies of its kind to ever be produced. He was a pivotal character who helped shape modern civilization  who paved the way for The Way of all ways - Jesus the Christ  King of kings  Who elevated Alexander the Great to prepare the way for the world to hear the Gospel of Everlasting Freedom and Life that no man  nor devil can ever take away from you. You can read a brief mention of The Goat of Grecia in the Old Testament book of Daniel  chapter 8:5-9  21-23  who prophesied Alexander's kingdom and its breakup into four kingdoms that serve as the foundation for the final New World Order Empire of the devil in the man anti-Christ. The film by Oliver Stone simply and beautifully portrays the real life of this young conqueror whose name will always be remembered as well as the name of Colin Farrell who played Alexander so eloquently. His co-actors in Alexander were also extraordinary!!! This film rates far above the highest rating the system can give!\tThe casting of Colin Farrell as Alexander was one of the all time goofs in movie casting. He could not even suppress his Irish accent for all his dialog. He looked so out of place in this role. The movie trailers lead you to believe this was an action movie depicting Alexander's march across the known world and beyond. Unfortunately  we saw most of the action scenes in the trailer. I've never had to endure so much boring endless dialog in my life. What did the Director's Cut add...more boring dialog. And how about those stupid flash backs repeating almost the same boring dialog between Alexander and his \""crazy\"" mother  another miscasting with Angelina Jole. I had to pause this movie 3 times and rest before I could go on watching it  hoping it would have some redeeming quality by the end. It did not. I'm just really grateful I did not go see this bomb at the movie theater. There is no way I could have endured this tripe and would have left. Do not waste your electricity watching this garbage on your home system.\tHaving names such Oliver Stone  Anthony Hopkins  Colin Farrell  Val Kilmer  Angelina Jolie  Christopher Plummer and Rosario Dawson in the cast; a great theme; and a huge budget  I could never expect that \""Alexander\"" could be a boring movie. However  the screenplay is simply awful  showing a long and very confused story that looks like a soap-opera  with many stupid lines. The characters and situations are not well developed  and the viewer is frequently surprised with actions or reactions without any previous explanations. The fight scenes are ridiculously choreographed  being a bloody and messy collection of blurred short images. The camera uses close-up most of the times and countless number of cuts. Angelina Jolie speaks with a ridiculous accent and I do not know what the intention of such behavior is. The free exploitation of gays and homosexual situations shows clearly the intention of raising a polemic theme to get the spots of the media and call the attention of the public in general. The extended running time bothered my family and I  and we were anxiously waiting for the end of this crap. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): \""Alexandre\""\tThe story about the thin line between greatness and evil dictatorship is told in an excellent way surrounded by great action  drama  actors  visuals etc etc etc... Again a masterpiece of a director who knows what movies are mend to be. This 3 hours movie felt as if its duration was about an hour. The fact that most negative reviews refer to the character of Alexander proves that the actor did a great job in playing a narcissistic traumatized stiff-head with great mental power and vision. Kept me thinking for several days and I'm still asking myself why the movie does not gets the credits it deserves. Is it too shocking to see a hero who's taste and value's do not comply with todays archetype of super man?\tI'm here to say that I didn't care if Alexander depicted gayness or not. I know enough of history to know that of the Greek culture. I'm here to say the movie was bad. Even Stone knew it as he edited out scenes for the director's cut. The narrative rambles and jumps around constantly  all the characters stay at arms length  the battle scenes are very few and poorly done  and Alexander comes off as a tyrant conquering the poor ignorant savages for their own good while caring nothing of the lives of his men. His claim to have shared everything with his men comes off cold and his attempts to bolster his men's courage come off as patronizing. It may be just my personal dislike that the characters are all either boring or stiff  but the cut of the movie is horrid. From Alexander's youth to his teens  to the last battle with Darius (for all intents and purposes) then when you think another gorilla war will take the movie Darius is found dead. True to history  yes  dramatic? no! Stone seems to be jumping around trying to cover this and that with no idea how to edit down the movie to a dramatic core. Even when conspiracies are unmasked it rushes ahead to their execution. Every time the scene changes I wonder where we are off too. The past? present? future? Fans of this film need to stop blaming the right wingers for some anti-gay conspiracy. It's just a bad movie from a guy who can often cross the line between brilliant and awful.\tVery impressive on a visual scale. Very grandiose as epics go. Not sure why Val Kilmer seems to speak with a bit of an Irish brogue and the one eye thing is kind of disturbing  though there is another fellow with one eye in the movie  I guess to balance it out. Angelina Jolie sounds like Count Chocula's wife! And the snakes  why all the damn snakes?!!! Sir Anthony seems a bit obese these days. The eyeliner on Alexander's lover what's with that?!! Troy certainly beats it in terms of plot  acting  and overall casting. The young man who plays young Alexander is a good young actor. The visuals are stunning  the battle scenes are epic. Mind you  this is just my personal rant! Please don't be offended. IT'S ONLY A MOVIE FOLKS!!\tI wish either Ridley Scott or Mel Gibsen had directed Alexander rather than Oliver Stone. The movie seemed out of kilter for me most the time with the endless flashbacks and skipping over of most of the history to spend too much time addressing the \""gayness\"" of Alexander. The Homoerotica didn't need to be so blatant in my opinion. I liked the several battle scenes  although  the dust in the battle of Gaugamela took away from the view. I guess this was to hide the CGI deficiencies  but I'm sure some will comment that it could indeed have been that dusty. It would have been good to show the battles of Granicus and Issus or the battle at Tyre with it's causeways and towers that Alexander's army had to build. Even abbreviated to set the scene with the final battle at Gaugamela against Darius. Also  it would have been neat to see that there were Greeks fighting with Darius against this Macadonian. The battle of Hydaspes against the Indians with their elephants was pretty good. Overall  the photography was good  acting pretty good  plot line was not fluid....and we were not let down by Director Stone when he threw in the conspiracy theory surrounding Alexander's death at the end. (Shades of JFK!)\tYou know you've got a stinker of a movie when they won't even release the theatrical cut on DVD... I skipped paying $10 at the theater to see it  so all I have to go on is the \""new and improved\"" version on the DVD... After watching it  and the commentary track version as well  the core problem seems to be that the story of Alexander just isn't well suited to the format of a a 2 and half hour movie... There's just too much story.The only way you could make a good movie about Alexander IMO is to do something similar to Amadeus  and make the lead character an observer of Alexander  that way you can skip the boring parts and focus on one aspect... For instance  Amadeus focused on the \""genius\"" aspect  with a subplot around the Father... But with Stone's Alexander  we get too much... There's the whole Father thing  the whole Mother thing  and then there's a series of battles that takes him all the way to India... In the end  its just WAY too much.\tViewers who expect an epic display of world conquest will be extremely disappointed in Oliver Stone's Alexander  which includes exactly two fairly brief battle sequences in its three hour running time. The film is not about conquest; it is an attempt to create a character study of one of history's most self-contradictory and enigmatic figures.The emphasis  however  should be on the word \""attempt.\"" Alexander fails in three basic ways: in its cast  in its refusal to meet certain character issues head-on  and in a directorial decision that easily ranks among the most serious misfires in recent memory.Alexander the Great was a charismatic  self-contradictory  and enigmatic leader who led and inspired the largest army the world had seen up to that point. He was a battle-tested killing machine by age sixteen  King of Macedonia by twenty  conqueror of the known world by thirty\u0097and above all one of the great military geniuses of his or any other age. Colin Farrell plays the character as a weak-minded  emotionally distraught entity  going through the entire film with a series of facial expressions that would lead to believe he is desperate need of a dose of salts. It is completely impossible to accept him in the role.Although Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie give acceptable if not particularly memorable performances as King Philip and Queen Olympias  the remaining performances are equally impossible. Jared Leto's Hephaistion looks for all the world like a Malibu hooker afflicted by an eyeliner addiction; it is impossible to perceive him as Alexander's military whip. Franciso Bosch's Bagoas could be an ancient-world version of Cher after a particularly thick night  albeit with better cleavage. As for Queen Roxane  history notes that she was an unattractive minor tribal princess that Alexander found annoying but whom he married in order to secure military aid from her father. The role  however  is considerably revised  and while Rosario Dawson gives it all she has the part plays like something out of bondage skin flick.During the film's theatrical release some audiences complained that Alexander was portrayed as a homosexual. Unfortunately  you cannot offer a psychological portrait of Alexander without indicating his general indifference to women and putting him in bed with at least two men: the general Hepaistion and the eunuch and sex slave Bagoas. That is who Alexander was; that was what the ancient world was like. But instead of meeting this issue head-on  the film attempts to \""indicate\"" the relationships through a series of longing gazes  the occasional caress  and some of the most embarrassingly bad dialogue ever written for the screen. The resulting relationships read like something off a television soap opera that has been canceled halfway into the first season.For the sexually insecure  there is a DVD issue that deletes some eight minutes of this footage; although I went with the unedited version  and although the scenes in question are very badly done  I cannot imagine the deletion of these largely cringe-inducing scenes improves the film to any significant degree\u0097largely because virtually everything about the film is no less awkward.The script is at best mediocre and the story line so incoherent that Anthony Hopkins is required to provide constant narration\u0097something that has the effect of telling us what happened rather than allowing us to see it happen. But by far the greatest failing of the script and story line is Oliver Stone's decision to present a chunk of the story  such as it is  out of sequence.In essence  the first half hour of the film establishes the tri-fold conflict between King Philip  Queen Olympias  and the young Alexander and runs up to a major confrontation. At this point the film suddenly jumps eight years ahead to the invasion of Persia  and the jump does not read as intentional but as an outrageous  unexpected  and disastrous flaw in the film. Approximately two hours later the film presents this \""lost time\"" in the form of a flashback\u0097but by this point of the scenes have been lost and we've all figured out the details anyway. Oliver Stone is a master of creating parallel story lines and time lines. One need look no further than JFK to see his skill. It is astonishing  utterly astonishing  that he could do no better than this and  not being able to do better  did not find a better way entirely.When all is said and done  Alexander is presented as an out-of-control weakling  his psychological motivations are hilariously pat at best  and it is utterly impossible to imagine that this person could command such a large force  much less lead it to a single victory  much less conquer the known world. Clearly Stone was attempting to reach a new height in epic cinema  but the Greeks had a word for ill-advised ambition founded on a god-like arrogance: hubris. It was a sin they believed was never left unpunished  and in this instance the punishment is a career-crippling  if not entirely career-killing  film.As noted  there are several DVD versions  including a director's cut that removes approximately fifteen minutes  eight of them dealing with Alexander's sexuality. Bonuses include documentaries on the making of the film and on composer Vangelis  who scored it  as well as an amazingly beside-the-point commentary by director Stone and historian Robin Lane Fox.Gary F. Taylor  aka GFT  Amazon Reviewer\tDon't let the defenders fool you. This movie is atrocious and it has absolutely nothing to do with Alexander's sexuality. His sexuality (questioned by many critics  I happen to believe he was homosexual) is one of the very few things about this movie which is well-written.The battle scenes are few and far between. The scenes we do get (Gaugamela and India) are haphazardly put together at best. The rest of the film seems to rest on the bizarre concept that Alexander is only conquering the world to escape his mother.Angelina Jolie (and why is she cast as Olympias??)  normally the bright spot in any film  doesn't help the picture. She has been given the direction to use some sort of anachronistic \""Transylvanian\"" accent that would do better in a Hammer Dracula movie than in this piece.Val Kilmer looks as if he wants to leave the film as soon as possible and the only real genuine emotion I felt during the film was pity for him.The blonde wigged Colin Farrell is far worse. He seems to jump back and forth from a caricature to an absurdity with great ease and lightning speed.Even Anthony Hopkins could not save this film.I give it a 3 because  after studying ancient history for most of my life  the computer generated scenes of Alexandria and Babylon are one of the few joys to be had in this film.\tAlexander is the most plodding  uneventful historical epic I have ever layed eyes on. Directed by Oliver Stone  he transforms the life of a major historical figure  Alexander the Great  into a muddled mess of a film  teaching us nothing of the man  not to mention his great quests.It had been public knowledge that Alexander the Great had been a pet project of Stone's for a long time  but after viewing the results it's hard to believe that Stone gave much thought to who this person really was. The film meanders from scene to scene  focusing first on Alexander's tempestuous relationships with both his mother and father  moving on to his victory against a superior Persian force at Gaugemela  his travels Eastward  eventually to India  finally his return to the city of Babylon and his undoing. Yet  as much as the above description seems to suggest that Stone covers Alexander's life  in the end I don't really feel as if I know much of anything about Alexander or those around him.Alexander's narrative is revealed via a voice-over by Alexander's associate Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) many years after Alexander's death  recounting the tales of Alexander's exploits. He tells of Alexander's early life with his mother  Olympias (Angelina Jolie)  and his father  King Phillip (Val Kilmer)  who are at each other's throats  although the film is never clear why. Alexander grows to manhood  in the guise of Colin Ferrell  and continues to have a contentious relationship with his father  and seems to start one with his mother  until his father dies  and Alexander sets out on a quest to bring those that he believes are responsible to justice. This leads to the battle with the Persians  and Alexander then moves on to conquer what is the known world  while at the same time  bringing civilization to the world.It is said that when a long movie is good  you never notice. Well  Alexander isn't one of those movies. Alexander seems to go on forever  scene after scene  with little or nothing interesting to offer the audience. Alexander appears to want to tell us the life story of the man  but frankly  he stays undeveloped. Yes  the film pays lip service to Alexander's desire to educate the world and bring civilization to those viewed as barbarians  but these are just words. Alexander features scene after scene where characters argue with each other  which seems like drama  except that these characters aren't really saying anything. The dialogue is just words pouring out because they need to. The characters say nothing of value.There is a lot of attention paid to Alexander's bisexuality  specifically his attraction to Hephastion (Jared Leto)  his longtime companion  but there is no interest to be generated from this relationship  or any other. There is no sense of chemistry or love  and later when Alexander takes a wife in the form of Roxane (Rosario Dawson) she serves as just window- dressing; again  there is no development of the relationship.In any historical epic  you usually expect some epic battle sequences  any while there are some attempted in Alexander  they are woefully inept. With no real interest in the characters  the battle scenes just go through the motions  providing no excitement or energy to the film at all. The second half of the film mostly focuses on Alexander's trip east  but the supporting characters are all undeveloped  ciphers with little or no personality  who are all interchangeable. When the men rise up in mutiny  and some Alexander's associates are implicated and killed  but their deaths mean nothing to us. There is some lip service payed to Alexander's relationship to his father and mother  but it all adds up to nothing  really. There is no sense of why Alexander defends either at any time  as they are both rather unappealing characters  and all Alexander seems to do whine and complain about both at different times  making look like a wimp  not a powerful ruler.The film also passes over major developments in his life  skipping major battles and lightly covering a major misstep when Alexander moves his soldiers through the desert in one scene. One gets the impression that Stone wanted to cram so much into one film that he glosses over many events that should prove instrumental to Alexander's life.When all is said and done  Alexander is a major failure  and an enormously disappointing film. There was a great deal of interesting material here  but it is all wasted on a bloated epic that proves to be pointless.\tHaving seen the Richard Burton version of Alexander's biography  I waited for the \""Director's Cut\"" DVD/VHS release to see what the newer film did.On the plus side: Philip and Olympias. Philip was an alcoholic  and Olympias did dig snakes (\""Keeping real snakes in the house of an alcoholic is not a good idea. It just complicates matters.\"" -- Will Cuppy). (Possible spoiler) That Olympias didn't seem to age could underscore her potential \""supernatural\"" reputation  as presented in the film.On the minus side: historic detail. Not only did we learn little of Alexander's military strategy (rather than seeming to know exactly what he was doing  we just see him as impulsive and headstrong). Further  prior to his battle with Darius  Alexander was overmatched in manpower by Darius  but Darius had troops up all night roaring defiance at the Macedonians to unnerve them. But that also exhausted his own men  leaving them to go into battle sleep-deprived. This was all overlooked in the film.The movie jumped around in time  and thus we're deprived of many of Alexander's conquests  such as Egypt (which explains  as the film doesn't really  how Ptolemy became Pharoah). As a general  Alexander was a military genius  and this isn't clear in the film.The epic of Alexander  as has been noted  included the fact that he could be as brutal as a velociraptor  but only his good side was shown. More's the pity; he was complex.Nonetheless  as historical fiction  the film entertains.\tThere is nothing I can say that hasn't been said a million times over  considering there are now over 90 pages of reviews of 'Alexander'. However  since I lost three hours of life watching this  I feel compelled to add my two cents.I am a lover of film  both bad and good. I had heard the bad reviews of this film  but was curious to see this based on the 'bisexual' controversy  not to mention it being helmed by Mr. Stone....how bad could it be? I think a precedent has been set in the bad movie pantheon. And not bad movie as in 'Showgirls'  but bad movie as in 'The Postman'.My complaints are the same as the others I have read....1. The casting agent should never be allowed to cast another movie EVER. Angelina Jolie as Colin Farrell's mother and sharing scenes with the adult Alexander...who's bright idea was it to cast two actors of the same age as parent and child? The last time we saw this was in 1974's 'Earthquake'  when Lorne Greene tried to pass as Ava Gardner's father. This was so much worse. The CGI crows feet and veins on Ms. Jolie's face did not work.2. Colin Farrell's horrendously bad bleached blonde mullet wig  was Alexander also a fan of bad 80's hair metal bands?? Distracting is too tame a word for his hair do  it should have also had top billing. His character would have looked more at home with a 'Ratt' or 'Skid Row' sleeveless T-shirt on than the little leather mini skirts he kept sporting.3. Angelina Jolie's hilarious Vampira accent made me wonder how many takes it took for the crew to stop cracking up when they filmed the scenes....everyone I watched it with laughed and laughed at every word she spoke. I blame this not on Jolie  but on Stone's lack of common sense when directing her.4. The oft mentioned sex scene with Farrell and Rosario Dawson...if Farrell is ever 'roasted' in later life  this is certainly the scene that will be shown to humiliate him. Was he channeling a lion? An alley cat in heat? It has to be seen to be believed.5. While I give Mr. Stone a lot of credit for including the bisexual aspect to the story  the scenes were uninspired. Jared Leto had more make up on than most of the women  and looked like he was ready to go to a Depeche Mode concert circa 1982  crimped hair and all. I would have preferred one kickarse roll in the hay scene with Farrell and Leto rather than the shots of them staring at each other over and over and over. Also  why did the 'gay' men all look like women? 6. A movie about Greeks with no actual Greeks in the cast? There were so many accents from all nations  I got confused and thought perhaps this was the Olympic games. Why not hire a credible Greek cast to AT LEAST fill in the supporting roles. A Greek historical figure with an Irish Americanaccent  how did Mr. Stone ever sell this to the studio? 7. The battle scenes  what happened there? While it certainly upped the gore quotient  who cares when you can't tell who is doing what to who? And why not have some discussion as to the strategies involved in winning the battles  is that too much to ask? 8. Was it really necessary to make the male child actors wear lipstick? 9. The music  a new low. It was all Hollywood spectacle music  and did not follow the plot in the least. Very generic and sweeping and lots of harps  I can't tell you how many times the group I watched this with rolled their eyes and discussed how bad the music was.10. Alexander's war helmet  what was that all about? It was gold and seemed to have additional room to allow his mullet to breathe  it was out of a bad 50's sci-fi movie.It's a punch in the gut to realize many of these actors all made millions of dollars to be in this movie.I gave it two stars for Colin Farrell's nude scene  which unfortunately is the only good thing I got from the film. I would have preferred to see those five seconds and just get the rest of my life back that I lost to this movie.\tStone's \""Alexander\"" tries to tell the story of one of the great military leaders and conquerors of all time who is to this day "
Alien vs. Predator (2004),"the film was rubbish. Why do they always leave movies like these to brainless idiots? The creator took the idea 'alien vs predator' so literally it hadn't occurred to me  what we saw was just dross. Too many bad things to mention  but this sums the film up well; even its catch phrase was wrong... whoever wins we lose  yet the human wins. Morons. Not only did they ruin aliens and predators just when they needed a new lease of life to recover from alien 4 and predator 2  they killed the entire storyline by setting it on earth present day. Its a shame but there'll be more films  one of them is bound to be good  assuming it gets a good director  instead of a pseudo-school kid.\tAVP is the worst movie I've ever seen. I can't believe it was a mainstream  big-advertisement movie. It was completely horrendous in nearly every aspect: the acting was about the lowest class you can find  the plot was pathetic beyond imagination  and the whole of the movie was riddled with obvious flaws and irrational antics. Here is a list of some of the flaws and antics.The most simple and irritating of the flaws was when they're in Antarctica and they're walking around in a light winter coat and an exposed face. Yeah  pretty sure you'd die in like half an hour.In the pyramid there's alien writing all over the walls and the guys go up and read it. It's an alien language!!!! The Predator goes into the pyramid and he's about to kill the old guy  but then he see's the old guy has a disease or something so he decides not to kill him. That's fine and can be justified. But then as the Predator leaves the old guy  the old guy says \Don't turn your back on me!\"" And then he tries to torch the Predator with a lighter and some spray. COME ON!!! That's got to be the stupidest movie moment of all time! Picture this: You see a huge  hulking alien come up and is just about to kill you  but then he decides not to. So you tough talk the alien and try to burn him to a crisp? NO ONE WOULD EVER DO THAT!!! When the Predator makes the girl that shield and spear  I thought to myself  'Cool  she's gonna go around and impale some aliens and stuff'. But guess what? She never uses the spear! Stupidest thing ever.There are probably some more big  stupid flaws throughout the movie  but I'm going to leave it at that. Even without the flaws  this movie sucked. The plot was just a rambling series of idiotic  gory  slimy action sequences. And the fight scenes weren't even cool! The only cool part was when the Alien impales the Predator's head with his extra mouth. That's about it. A dumb thing that I didn't get about that part was that the one Alien killed two Predators. I thought the Predators were way more powerful than aliens  because in that flashback on the pyramid there are three Predators fighting waves of Aliens. I don't know.The climax of the movie was just a cry for help. I had no idea what was happening. They were all fighting Aliens and stuff  and before I knew it  they were running away and the pyramid blew up for some reason. It was extremely abrupt. And that's pretty much the whole movie in its sucky entirety.\tEverything about this movie is extremely average and the movie doesn't feature one thing that hasn't been done before. Its extremely formulaic simple entertainment with a way too simple story and uninteresting characters.Where did it went wrong? Simple  it went wrong from the moment they hired Paul W.S. Anderson. He hasn't made ONE movie in his career that is interesting  original or simply above average. This movie really is no exception. It has a typical Anderson style  meaning that it's filled with flaws. But Anderson is even worser as a writer  the story he wrote for this movie is incredibly simple and features awful dialog and dull characters.Anderson's directing is truly the weakest thing of the movie. His directing of the actors feels lacking  with as a result that the actors don't have an awful lot to do in this movie and their performances come across as bad. Even Lance Henriksen's role. Also the directing of the action sequences are seriously lacking. Although some of the action does has its moments  it is badly filmed and horribly edited. Halve of the time I couldn't even exactly tell what was happening.The characters are completely uninteresting and of some you don't even get to know their names. Why should you even care for the characters in this movie? None of them is likable or easy to relate with. Also what was with the many accents in this movie? It was quite irritating to be honest.But even worse were some of the sounds that the aliens and predators were making. The predators made the sounds of lions and the aliens that of elephants. It made me seriously laugh when I heard the queen alien trumpet. So thumbs down for the sound department as well.The movie is not as bad as I make it sound now maybe but it's just that this was a movie with so much potential but somehow Anderson turned it into the most formulaic and average movie possible. I mean when you have to concept of making the aliens fight the predators  then surely there is something better they could had come up with.The movie is slightly below average because of the extremely simple and uninteresting story and characters. Still the special effects are good and some of the action is enjoyable enough to make this movie still a watchable one.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/\tNot a bad work. The special effects are thrilling  and the action borderlines intense  but the acting is crap. And the fact that two of the(will not list what species) are killed in the same scene was dumb. It's not very Alien versus Predator  if two of the (will not list what species) die back-to-back.I did like the idea of a pyramid in Antartica  but to have it under the ice blows chunks  and the movie takes to long to pick up. Sure there's a snippet or two here and there of a Predator ship  but other wise  no extraterrestrial action until later on. The plot is mediocre and full of holes  and  as aforementioned  the acting is poor  and when coupled with your aunt's constant jawing about what this person or that person should be doing  you've got yourself a heaping platter of man-speak that will drive you insane. If you know of someone who won't shut up during a movie about the characters and their actions  do not watch this movie with that person.On a positive note  as I have already said  the fight scenes are really cool  and the Predators and Aliens look much better than they used to. The movie also features really nifty camera angles that make for cool shots. And of course  the last battle between Predator and Alien features potentially the coolest action shot ever (but I'll let you see for yourself). So  in short  decent with good special effects but poor acting. 6 outta 10.\tThere's no tension  the plot is simple and nothing is fitting with the great Alien-movie history. For example:the life-cycle of Alien is completed within several hours - not daysthe scientists can read ancient languages as if they where written in English the way or why and how Bishop appears is not explained - much more later in Alien chronology we happen to meet Bishop in flesh and Blood again the characters are easy to see through  you can guess from the first second who will survive and who will not.Disappointing  don't waste your time with it.\ti very nearly left the cinemaits just plain awful and I'm never seeing a film by this director againthere's a guy covered in snow  in the first predator film when hes covered in mud the predator couldn't see him because of the heat sensor not picking anything up ...in this they just turn round and kill him...i thought they were going to walk past him because thats the rules...and they couldn't of had better technology because the first film I'm sure was based into the futureall the stuff that happens takes away the rules of the other filmslike how quickly the aliens burst from the stomachs and so onthe most annoying thing is the how 1 its now a 15 so can't put as much violence into it and 2 the camera angle changes so often you can't tell whats going on anyway...a foot a face was that blood oh hes dead nowand also at the end after the predators have killed without thought one of the women befriends it and almost kisses the predatorjust plain stupid...don't think hes ever made a good film what with mortal kombat and resident evil\tI must preface my comments by first saying that on a purely visceral level  I did like Alien vs Predator. Alexa held her own very well. So well in fact that I would like to see her again. It was a real thrill seeing the predators and the aliens get it on. It was also cool to see humans totally out of their league on a battle field of dueling behemoths. True underdogs. For any of them to survive was a real triumph  yet I totally bought the rationale behind Alexa's survival.Now for the criticisms: What went wrong? The predators have been going through this Right-of-passage training ritual for thousands of years. They built many labyrinthian pyramids  presumably getting better at it as time went on. So again  what went wrong? They are obviously aware of the current stage of human technological development because they lured us their with heat blooms to attract our satellites. Did they think we went there to ritually sacrifice our selves. If so  why did they kill everyone in the whaling station? Why was it so surprising that the team found their way to the predators canons? There were no obstacles. If we can build a satellite we just might be able to read hieroglyphs and figure out their sarcophagus calender lock which was based on our own planet's cycles. The predators boomerang charikons and their spears were made of metal impervious to the alien's acid blood (unlike their wrist bayonets that instantly melt on contact). Why wasn't the mother alien shackled with that stuff? And if the conveyor belt is designed to take her eggs to the sacrificial chamber  how did all of those other eggs get into the aliens incubation room. How was the pyramid designed to stop this? The poor design of the pyramid is inconsistent with the technological sophistication that built their ultra quiet ship with ultra refined controls. One last thing. The mother speared the predator through it's back and out of its chest with her tail and kills it. The tag scene has the predator/alien larvae burst out of the dead predator's chest. Why break out when the mother conveniently supplied a ready made birth canal? And more curiously  why was the alien larvae not killed when mom speared the host through the chest? And even more curiously  why did she kill the last predator. Alien 3 established that they do not kill impregnated hosts. Or was it because in Alien 3 the larvae was a mother alien? Which means that they will kill their young  but that is contrary to their previous behavior  except in Alien Resurrection (which I hated  so I will not go any further with that). Or should I just ignore this fact because very few people like Alien 3. Personally  I liked a lot about that one also.\tWell AvP...It's true enough to say the movie had a lot to live up to  the game had given me a hunger for story driven non-stop action that didn't come at the cost or should i say sacrifice of making a movie look like it had simply been engineered for an audience.the film left questions to be answered and a strange sinking suspicion that what I had watched would have been impossible even had the 2 species existed and had clashed in open confrontation.Putting that a side I was simply glad to see the franchise live on  and no one can deny the excitement and tension of simply thinking about these creatures locked in mortal combat. The fight scenes were impressive enough to excuse a possibly \""wooden\"" plot - but at the end of the day I expected nothing more than edge of my seat action. To be fair the acting was impressive seeing as they had a tough story to bring alive - but pats on the back all round from my camp! I want more aliens and I want more predator - I want more AvP!\tLiterary Appeal - One thing that I'm not surprised about is that I've not heard any critics mention the setting and premise being close to H.P. Lovecraft's 'At the Mountains of Madness'. Lovecraft is considered to be basically the greatest horror writer of the 20th century  often called the 20th century Edgar Allan Poe; 'At the Mountains of Madness'  one of his three novels  is considered to be his masterpiece. The Lovecraftian element of the film is something that will be ignored by almost everyone. In my opinion  this is one of the movie's strong points; the fact that the movie places the two most recognizable hostile ETs of pop culture together within this premise and setting. And the fact that this Lovecraft basis is esoteric.Philosophical / Deeper Meaning Value - Most viewers also don't think about the darker and philosophical side of a movie like 'Alien'  which is just as much Gothic horror as it is science fiction (like Lovecraft's work). In 'Avp'  when the expedition team is standing at the mouth of the cave  no one even dares suggest that maybe ETs created the hole in the ground. I really liked this element  because it seems like real life; people don't want to be considered crazy for suggesting that they believe in the possibility of this reality. Lovecraft's mythos dealt greatly with the theme of mankind's small place in this vast universe  and the fact that most human beings ignore this...most people are probably just interested in the FX / rubber costumes and familiar hero characters. One article I remember reading in a paper  started with whining about how there was no Arnie or Sigourney  so the movie must be terrible.The fact that the premise of the movie is based on a 'Chariots of the Gods' concept with the mixed-culture first civilization  is another strong point. And I've always liked the appeal of the Predator species being an ancient  advanced intelligent species that relies only on a primitive or basic society honor code to hold together their society.Pulp Appeal - Not every movie is 'Citizen Kane' or 'Lawrence of Arabia'. 'AvP' is supposed to be a modern day 'Godzilla vs Mothra'; and it is a great rendition of this concept of film. It is not the most intelligent movie ever made. Part of the basis comes from video games and comic books  not Shakespeare  but it still manages to have some level of depth and intelligence while still appealing to 12-year-olds. Most comic book-based movies are just centered on action  and hero figures with fake values.Production / Design - The flow of action and the storyline do move at a somewhat slow pace; this is one of the negative sides of the movie. But  the first 'Alien' film does too. And 'Predator'  like 'Alien'  does not reveal the creature until toward the end. Both are some of the best creature designs ever created. And the gestation of the Aliens was somewhat rushed; but if you think about it  maybe the Aliens were genetically engineered by the Predators to grow faster; they are certainly an advanced enough species. The eggs that were lying around inside the derelict craft in 'Alien' had been dormant for eons.The set design of the underground ruins I thought was well crafted and designed  along with the awesome queen chamber reminiscent of the comic books. The scenes with the Predator craft descending from the sky were awesome. The action and battle scenes were well-executed and there was some level of unpredictability and suspense; but I agree with some critics who think there should have been a little more fighting between the two creatures. The queen fight sequence at the ending was excellent  and I like the way the female figure's role followed along with the comic series. The strongest horror element I think was the helplessness of the humans being trapped in the middle of the struggle.Overall  I would give the movie about a 7.5 rating. A little bit of a slow and dry beginning. Some great esoteric appeal with the Lovecraftian basis (even though I'm not sure the team behind the movie intended this)  some level of depth and intelligence if you look for it  and a good comic book-based movie.\tOK so i thought when i saw this its a kinda mix between the obvious Aiens and Predator and a dabble of Freddy vs Jason  and when i left the cinema i mean i have to admit i loved the film yes there were so many down points  the actors  why not have Halle Berry instead of what her face or at least someone who could act  i mean that scene you know 'La Luna Del Catchatori' how bored did they sound  when they laughed at they end it was almost 'is it time to leave' kinda laugh  kinda pointless.The fact also that predators seemed at one point in the film stronger in another weaker back and forth they went  and the fact that the scarred one you know second to die the fat one  the fact that he/she/it didn't realise that the Alien had acid blood is quite stupid considering they were meant to be hunting these every 100 years and so i would have thought they would've caught onto the idea that they have acidic blood.There are more bad points  but even so despite all the downers i loved this film  i mean Bishop  Maxwell and Verheiden i loved them 3 really like there acting the rest well utter rubbish quite frankly.But then comes the Aliens  and this time they seemed a lot realer (i know digital advances) AND you could kind of relate to the Aliens  no their need to kill but you actually had an Alien who you remembered you know the one i mean  cross hatch head  again the fact that  that alien survived 1 Predator is amazing but even so the alien no has character.Plus the fight scenes between alien and predator  although so unbalanced at each fight it still was a great sight to see i love every minute of it. OK so really they should have put more time  REAL actors and balanced it out more but even so i still will watch this many times just for those fight scenes  just to see the Predator chop an Aliens head off. Just for that experience\tif you like the predator movies you will like this movie and try to remember its just a movie there is no need to pick it a part piece by piece you cant enjoy a movie if your sitting there pointing out the flaws the fight scenes are bad ass just lots of destruction and violence the first scene that has predators facing off against aliens is hardcore to say the least the story is pretty good too it keeps you wanting to know more about predators and why they come to that spot to hunt so keep in mind what i said earlier if you go looking for something to pick in a movie you wont enjoy it so keep in mind relax its just a movie\tStupid is the word that comes to mind after watching this movie. A group of explorers find a pyramid under the polar cap in Antartica. The rich guy  Weyland  wants to be the first one there to claim it as his find site. So  he rounds up an expert in ice climbing  Alexa  and an expert in Myan pyramids along with others. You'd think they would get a clue something's wrong when they get there and a tunnel from the surface to the pyramid has magically appeared. But no  they go ahead down the tunnel. So  we lean that the Predators lured the humans there. They have an alien in hibernation who is woken up. It starts producing eggs. Some humans get trapped with the eggs  so the alien breeding has started. The predators have hunted aliens for centuries as a sport. So some of the humans get trapped in the pyramid as aliens and predators battle. So  who survives  well who cares since this was so dumb.This was pg-13  so there are no good bloody deaths. It's very mild  another problem with the film. It is a far cry from the original Predator and Alien movies.FINAL VERDICT: Bad  one of those movies so bad it may get a cult following and one day be popular  but not yet. If you liked Aliens or Predator  skip this because it ruins the greatness of its predecessors.\ti saw alien vs. predator. at the theater. and boy was it terrible. but. despite the complete disregard for a plot. scenes where predator should have been whooping some serious alien tail. but instead made friends with some one hundred and ten pound black woman who i could take if i were in a life threatening coma. that would have never survived in the first place. and the persons who edited the film obviously being drunk. it ruled. although i think a rippin soundtrack would have made it way better. maybe even def leppard being in the pyramid when they got there. anyway. i added my own music throughout the movie. all and all it was really fun. making fun of it. and besides it being really bad. it was rated PG-13. and it doesn't take a genius to realize this means no 'f' word. no graphic sex scenes. no horribly brutal deaths. only vague innuendos of potentially brutal deaths.if you have to put 'slime and gore' in the rating to make it sound cool. your movie isn't good.paul w.s. anderson. he also directed resident evil. which was bad. as well as event horizion. which just so happens to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life. seriously.see this movie because it is retarded. but pay no more than a dollar fifty for it. please. god.\tIf you have put this movie on your wish list  then you will be disappointed. However  if you find yourself watching it  without wanting to  you'll find yourself saying 'just what I expected' The prologue was way too long  and the exciting scenes aren't very long. They are  however  exciting and freaky. What I also didn't like was how fast the humans die and the characters picked to explore the place where everything takes place in the first place. So  like I said  if this movie is on your wish list  don't get too excited. If you find yourself watching it  without wanting to  you'll find yourself saying 'just what I expected' rating 4/10\t...they will get it right. Better than many angry fan-boys (myself included) would have you believe  it still isn't as good as it should have been.Satalites pick a heat signature underneath the ice layer in the Antarctic. A research team arrives and accidentally unleashes the alien creatures contained within. Simutamniously  a pack of young predator hunters arrive to begin their initiation hunt into adulthood. 3 species  only one survivor.The first  huge mistake the film makes is it's white-washed PG-13 rating. All four 'Alien' and both 'Preditor' films were pretty hard R-rated; so why ostracize the fans of the films in such a way? Answer: so that kids can't in too  even though it's a horror/action film that kids shouldn't be watching anyways.Next up is the pacing of the film. Every one going to see this knows the deal with the aliens  knows the deal with the predators and knows that they are going to be fighting each other. So why spend the first 57 minutes of a 100 minute movie trying to wrap all the plot details in a mystery? Answer: actually  I don't have anything for that  there was just no reason for it. If you make a film called 'X vs. Y' you better not take 2/3 of the film for X and Y to start scrapping on each other.Which finally brings up what the film does right; once the pointless exposition (which fails to ever explain that the predators are supposed to be teenagers) is over and the action kicks in the film shifts into high gear and zips along at a break neck pace. The first battle between the two malevolent ETs is a great bit of action violence; my only complaint with it is that it makes the dull first hour of the film look all the more dull by comparison. It does finally give you what you want  it just makes you wait a long time for it.For the first hour of the film  it give it a 4  the last 40 minutes get an 8; ergo- 6/10\tAlien vs. Predator is an embarrassment to the state of current American cinema. While I am not a fan of either series  I went into this film expecting something similar to 2003's Freddy vs. Jason. I was gravely disappointed. The overly concerned MPAA has caused films like this to be released with a PG-13 rating  which in turn has caused the filmmakers to get overly sloppy. The editing  pacing  acting  and special effects are simply some of the worst I have ever seen. The director  Anderson  should be ashamed of himself for putting his name on this piece of garbage. What gets me is that people actually went to see this (I rented it on On Demand and want my $2.99 back...seriously). And the ending...I called it before the film even ended.An embarrassment. 1 out of 10\tIt may be our planet but it's their war! The deadliest creatures from the most successful sci-fi/horror movies ever made face off the first time on film. Based on a Dark Horse Comic Book.A Team of Scientist and Adventurers are sent to Antractica  after the scientists have discover an ancient pyramid buried under the ice. When they get close to the frozen continent. The team makes an eerie discovery:Two Alien Races engaged in a ultimate battle. Whoever Wins... the human race will lost.Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Event Horizon  Resident Evil  Soldier) made an silly but enjoyable take off to the Alien and Predator series. The best way to enjoy the film  if you don't the story seriously. Fans of the Alien Series will enjoy Lance Henriksen's role in the film  since he's best known as Bishop from Aliens and Alien 3. Henriksen gets to play the real Charles Bishop Weyland  who is in the film a billionaire industrialist. Sanaa Lathan in the lead role will remind you of Sigourney Weaver from the Alien films.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an terrific-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in DTS). DVD has two enjoyable commentaries by the director  actors:Lathan & Henriksen  visual effects supervisor:John Bruno and creature effects designers/creators Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff  Jr. DVD also has Deleted Scenes  Making of a Featurette  Dark Horse Comics AVP Cover Gallery and more. The DVD also has an alternative version of AVP with an alternate beginning. The latest DVD is the 2 disc set  which it features the original theatrical cut and extended cut. DVD has the same picture quality and sound from the previous transfer. But the extended cut is disappointing  The director added eight minutes of additional footage but DVD cover promises more battles and more violence. That's simply not true  The filmmaker added character development instead and there's more CGI blood than the PG-13 version. But second disc has plenty of featurettes from Pre-Preduction to Post-Production and more. Anderson's film is simple but it has some exciting visual moments  which their are sensational. The film is fun enough to overcome the illogically plotting of Anderson's screenplay. Screen Story by Anderson  Dan O'Bannon (Alien) and Ronald Shusett (Dead & Buried). Although O'Bannon and Shusett had nothing to do with Anderson's original screen story. But Anderson used elements from O'Bannon and Shusett's story from Alien  that they were never filmed from the original 1979 film. Shane Salerno actually co-wrote the screenplay with the director:Anderson. Which is Salerno is uncredited. Super 35. (****/*****).\tI challenge you to find a cooler movie alien/monster. I mean  come on...Godzilla? I don't think so. King Kong? Dude  be real. I will waive my judgment until after I see Peter Jackson's version coming out soon. The concept of the Predator is simply amazing...if you like geeky sci-fi...like I do.Without spoiling anything  the Aliens and Predators...are you sitting down...well  they fight!! This is a great special effects movie  and one that doesn't really flesh out the human characters. This is the kind of crap most people complain about. If I go to a movie called Alien Vs. Predator  chances are very high that I am watching the human characters to see the interesting ways that the Predator will dispose of them.That being said  the guide  an actress who I have never heard of  actually does a good job in the film. She is the only human that does. Enough about humans. The Aliens are generally a grumpy crew  and the Predators are looking to hunt. What follows is a scene almost as grisly as my plate  after eating a 16 oz. Ribeye...rare.If you like the franchises  and want to see a cool action movie  this is a must-see. If you want a sappy movie that captures the human spirit  please never talk to me.\ti saw this film and i kinda likes it but i saw it again and i hated it i thought it was the worst film in the world. the action was kinda cheesy and the acting was terrible. the story was good but could of had a better director. but one thing that got me really mad off was that they made the film pg13. the alien and predator franchise has been rated r. how the hell do u make it pg13.i thought the movie could have been more like the video game. the marines vs the predators vs the aliens.the thing i didn't like was that the predators died to quickly. and also the inferred was kinda lame.i give this movie 3 stars because the story was good but the acting  action and rating was very lame and wasn't really great.\tThis was probably the best movie I have seen all summer!! The only thing that could have made it better would be if the girl and the alien had made out at the end. I mean  this movie had a classic love-story plot  but we never got the inter-species love pay-off. See  the best thing about AVP was that it really broke all the rules of good movie-making. I knew this movie was going to be good when none of the characters had names for the first half hour (or more!). And I was floored that they actually killed off everyone! Such balls! They just took the rules of good film-making and spit on them. And it worked! I don't think the writers even bothered to see if the plot made sense. Because frankly  I couldn't even list all the plot holes  they were so numerous! Amazing!"""
Alone in the Dark (2005),"Tara Reid as an intellectual  Christian Slater(usually great) as a dollar store Constantine and Stephen Dorff as...well it's STEPHEN DORFF FOR Christ SAKE!!!! I personally just want to thank those brilliant casting directors for the hard work and effort. You guys are on. Heres an idea  just my humble lowly opinion as the movie going public but it follows directly with your previous choices a movie about the most brilliant neuro-physicist in history invent one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man and get this  heres the clincher they have to be played by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you guys would love that. Seriously though you owe me $7.50.\tAlone in the Dark is a very good film that has a good cast which includes Christian Slater  Tara Reid  Stephen Dorff  Frank C. Turner  Mathew Walker  Will Sanderson  Mark Acheson  Darren Shahlavi  and Karin Konoval  The acting by all of these actors is very good. Slater  Reid  and Dorff are really excellent in this film. I thought that they performed good. I thought their looks were neat as well! I do not understand why the heck this is on the IMDb Bottom 100 #44? This movie gives you everything! I thought that this was a very cool film! Here's what Alone in the Dark gives you! 1. Incredible action and fights! 2. Long shoot outs rarely seen nowadays in films.3. Awesome creatures that's scary  extremely tough to kill and rips people to shreds!4. Army battles monsters and monsters destroys the army! 5. A great story! So what the heck is bad about this one? Its seems like when there is a film that is really cool and everything happens that is when you people all join together and hate it! As for the scene between Slater and Reid there was nothing there! Just a love scene and not what these people say it is and I saw nothing a wrong with her looks in this film! This is all my opinion! I mean the thrills is really good  the movie is filmed very good  the music is very good  and the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end. If you haven't seen this film and if you like Christian Slater  Tara Reid  Stephen Dorff  Frank C. Turner  Mathew Walker  Will Sanderson  the rest of the cast in the film  Action  Horror  Thrillers  Adventure  Dramas  and interesting films then I strongly recommend you ignore all of the bad comments and see this film today!\tNow 'Alone In The Dark' hasn't received great reviews from the critics  actually if you look on Rotten Tomatoes it get's an all time low score of 1%-it actually scores less than that in theory as it only received one 'good' review out of 101!!!! Can it be that bad? Well.......Thing's start off badly with a ridiculously long Star Wars style scroll which is also spoken in case you can't read.We are then straight into a car chase including box's of vegetables getting hit  how's that for a clich\u00e9? then a fight  with loads of slo-mo camera work  resulting in the death of the bad guy which seems to go un-noticed in the market place! Christian Slater is unfortunate to be the star of this turkey with Tara Reid co-staring as his girlfriend who is an archaeologist  you can tell she's clever as she wears glasses and her hair in a bob  though she does spend most of the movie running around in a naval revealing tank top.She was obviously hired for her looks and not her acting ability as she plainly has none  I can't recall such a wooden performance for some time! The movie meanders on at a snails pace  we get a pointless and utterly gratuitous love scene  then some monster's appear and a SWAT style team lead by the dreadful Stephen Dorff  spend the rest of the movie trying to kill them and the movie turns into a dreadful low grade Aliens style flick-but without the horror and suspense! There are bad movies which are 'good' as they are entertaining  this is just plain bad.\tSeeing these types of movies  makes me wonder  who slept with who to get this film into production?? Second of all  who did Tara sleep with to get this role?? Don't even get me started on her acting \skills\"". Also  I think the director knew this movie was going to be a flop  so out of the blue he just put a sex scene in there. It didn't have anything to do with the plot  it was like he just wanted to see a chunky Tara Reid get naked. Do you know how many movies got ripped off by this film. I saw so many scenes that i have seen from other movies like Aliens  X-Files  and basically every other movie out there. I wish i look at the comments on here before i watched this movie  it is in the bottom 100! Of course! 1 out of 10\tSince I live in Sweden  I wasn't even aware that this movie had been released until my boyfriend so kindly showed me IMDb to then discover all this negative criticism. So I decide to BUY the movie and see it for myself if it actually could be THAT bad. To then discover that it's like any other Video Game movie. Resident Evil and the follower Resident Evil: Apocalypse is video game based movies that has an actress who started her career as a model. Now  Tara Reid has actually worked within commercials. I'm not saying that it makes her a better actor  but please  she is better then Sarah Michelle Gellar who plays Buffy - the big blonde vampire slayer. They even made a follow up and movies out of Buffy. Who wants to see a follow up on her demonic boyfriend Angel who can be compared with Vin Diesel's so called \""acting\"". None of them can act. Angel probably even acts better then Vin Diesel and guess what those two has in common! Bad acting and good looks! So what if we would see a follow up on Aline Cedrac? Alone with Aline? Or Alone with Aline: 2? My point is exactly that no one cares about acting in an \""all action\"" movie or series! They want to see blondes and good-looking guys that kicks some bad guys/girls in a amazing way!So there are a few glitches in the story  but this movie should have been a longer movie with more background. Other from that  I can't see what there is to complain about. All in all  who can make a Vide Game better then this or then Resident Evil? I doubt anyone could do this movie better when it comes to effects and actresses or actors. All that is needed  is someone who could have directed them more. Because to blame the actor to be bad is easy  but this is not one of those movies where they lack in talent. This is a movie where the one to blame is Uwe Boll  because he should have used the actors and the actress to give their full ambition in this movie. So  if any of you out there  is so sure that this movie is bad  I would like to know how you ever could get a Video Game movie as the games. Because I am sure that no one can make a video game movie as good as the video game.So all I can see is a lack of directing and story. Other from that  this movie is completely action! And that what was I expected. Because that's what video games is about  right? And I believe Tara Reid acts better then that character on your video game. So unless your character in the game can give such a pretty face as Tara Reid can then you have nothing on the Alone in the Dark-movie. If you didn't want anyone to put a face on your characters  then you should keep yourself to the video game and not the movie. In which  I doubt you would even play the game if it wouldn't contain action.It's an action movie. What did you expect? What Uwe Boll did  was to make the game into a action movie. A >action< movie. I want to point out that the action movie contains special effects  monsters and a lot of guns and >action<. So if you didn't know  a video game being all action and being made into all action can't be as bad as everyone points out.I like it. Why? Because I bought an action movie and got an action movie.If there were one movie that was the biggest joke in the universe it would be \""Boa vs. Python\"" and not at all \""Alone in the dark\"".\tSpoilers ahead  but does it really matter? Have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions? Could this be it? Why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world? Why is this question never answered? Why was the opening text crawl incoherent? Why would a nun (she sure seemed nice!) hand over 20 orphans to a madman? Has there always been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why does one of the gold mine's shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage? Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly show up at Christian Slater's apartment for sex? (Or did I just answer my own question?) Why would even a non-archaeologist bang open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer? Why would modern computers still display green pre-Tron-era grid outlines of objects  complete with little \""bleeps\""? And must all movie explosive timers have digital displays? Why doesn't ANYTHING in this movie make any sense?\tFirst off I'd like to say that if I had to honestly rate this movie from a 1 to a 10  then I'd give it a -4. It's not that I'm a tough critic  it's just that this movie is THAT bad. Everything from the story  to the directing  to the editing is awful. The story is not even halfway decent to begin with (you can't expect much since it is based on a video game  something I was not aware of going into the movie) but the directing and editing made it even worse. The movie cuts at awkward points and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous ones; some  like a quick sex scene in the middle  don't even make sense being put into the story seeing as how the characters don't show any feelings toward each other. You could go into this movie expecting to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you'd still be disappointed. Honestly  if you pay to watch this movie then you are wasting your money  and if you don't pay anything then you are still wasting an hour and a half of your life. So do yourself a favor and don't watch it.\tThis is a really sad movie. I didn't know what it was about. I was watching it with an open mind and it still was awful. There was one part at the end of the movie that I had to rewind and play over again about 4 times. And even then turn on the subtitles just to find out what Christian Slater was saying. I could not understand him at all when he was saying one of his lines. I give it a 2 simply because I can't give Christian a 1. There was really nothing that I liked about this movie except one thing. The graphics weren't that great. You really don't even get to see the monsters. You only see flashes here and there. I did like the creative ways that some of the people were killed.\tI know that a lot of people have spent a lot of time writing wonderful reviews of this film that really describe in vivid detail how awful this movie truly is. I wanted to do the same thing  but after watching this film  I went to my doctor and he told me that I was now mildly retarded. He didn't know I had seen this movie the night before  so he ran a bunch of tests and kept saying \""I just don't get it...\"" over and over  but that is a story for a different time.All I can say is that whatever this movie is supposed to be  it isn't. Was it supposed to be scary/suspenseful? Maybe  if your idea of scary/suspenseful is coming downstairs as a little kid on Christmas morning to see if you got a brand new bike  and instead you find your father naked and he throws strawberry jelly in your face and punches you in your nutsack. Confused? So was I when I watched this movie.Was this film supposed to be a horror film? Oh  it was a horror. Kind of like if your Mom wanted to scare neighborhood children on Halloween  so she put on a devil mask and painted bullseyes on her nipples and had the kids shoot her in the tits with BB guns. Would that be horrible? Sure would  just not in the way it was intended to be. Kind of like this movie; its not a horror movie  its a horror of a movie.About 3/4 of the way through the movie I inexplicably started beating my girlfriend. That's right. This film was so bad it made me an abuser. It has also been traced as a root cause of alcoholism  epilepsy  dick cancer  and gingivitis. Oh . and Stepehen Dorf is in it  so what did I expect? That guy is a no-talent ass clown.\tAlone in the Dark is proof that people really need to see things for themselves before judging them. I remember the movie lasting barely two weeks at the box office  and getting a 1% rating at Rotten Tomatoes.com. After listening to my friend's rambling about how this was the worst movie ever made  that the director Uwe Boll needed to be be loaded as cargo on a kamikaze plane  I decided to stay clear of it entirely.Well  by some funny accident  I saw it anyway. I rented Shaun of the Dead last night and found a DVD for Alone in the Dark sitting snugly in its place with \""Haha  LOSER \"" written across disk instead. I figured that since this would probably be the only time I would ever be able to see it  because I would have never rented it on my own time.I must admit that having extremely low expectations had something to do with it  but I didn't find this movie to be nearly as bad as most people said it was. Sure folks  it's bad  maybe even Razzie worthy  but it had enough style to stay entertaining. The movie opens up with some painfully slow text that moves up the screen  spoon-feeding you the plot within 60 seconds. One thing to note is that this was actually a bit of a bonus  because without it the actual movie would have been too confusing to stand. The action sets in fast enough  and our main hero does battle with some random character who's role isn't even made clear until HALFWAY through the film. That's the major weakness of Alone in the Dark. The plot and story telling isn't exactly solid gold  it's more like rusted copper. The movie is inept  confusing  hard to follow for the first 30 minutes. There are a lot of things that could have made it much better. A different style of editing  better music  and some proper research on military tactics and protocol could have really done wonders for the whole project.As far as acting  the only thing it has going for it is Christian Slater  who pulls off a great performance. The rest of the cast is mediocre at best  and the line delivery is sometimes clumsy enough to land most of them in a special education school.The score is about twice as messy as the script for the film. It's horrible  and the guy who composed it should be doing music for elevators. The action that goes with it is some of the most stylish and entertaining I've seen  but a lot of it is pointless  and just isn't a part of the story. The monsters themselves are extremely cool  and for the first time since The Lost World we're reminded that shading and atmosphere are just as important as the CGI itself. It's damn good  and the creatures look realistic enough to be put in a zoo.On that note  there's enough in Alone in the Dark for me to enjoy it at least  but it's a mess of mindless action  horrid writing and some of worst music I've heard in a long time.4/10 stars\tThis should be my kind of movie. Even if it sucked  it still should have been right up my alley; hell  I like \""Congo \"" and \""Allan Quatermaine\"" movies. I have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien/demon/adventure movies. Let's go over why I decided to watch this in the first place.1. Horror/Sci-fi almost always intrigues me 2. I'm a big fan of archaeology  and this movie does involve a rare treasure. 3. Super-natural enemies with quality FX. 4. Christian Slater and Dorf I generally enjoy. 5. Tara Reid is hot.So this movie had potential  at least in the cheese-horror section of the video store  but boy did it suck ass. The only redeeming aspects are Slater and Dorf  and not everyone finds them as entertaining as I do...I mean  let's face it  both are melodramatic. But now on to some of the many faults.Tara Reid. Even though the movie as a whole is worse  Reid's performance is truly awful. We're not just talking bad  I'm talking about nominating Tara Reid for worst performance of the year. I don't know if she is capable of acting  but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league...completely. Watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist wasn't much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn. I mean this isn't just bad  it is laughably bad. Oh  and for those of you curious  she doesn't get naked  only down to a bra in a silly  totally unnecessary love scene.Even with Reid's performance  perhaps the movie could have worked  but the plot is what dominates  and the plot seems written by a 10 year old. I hadn't realized this was a video game adaptation until AFTER watching the DVD  otherwise I would have appreciated the stupidity in real-time. The storyline jumps back and forth from Slater's childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened  he has amnesia  of course. In his adult life Slater was recruited by some Unit 713  a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something. Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious  I guess  you never really know unless it was in one of those voice-overs I zoned out during. The movie starts with Slater hunting artifacts  obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a \""Chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities.\"" I may have the exact quote wrong  but you get the idea.There is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth (no reason given)  experiments on children  super demon/alien-human hybrids  \""photonic\"" bullets (the demon things can't stand sunlight) and  of course  Slater and Dorf to try to save everyone.Jesus  I can't even being to wade through the clich\u00e9d elements. The script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide SOME depth. I mean  why is this evil scientist so damn evil? Oh right  humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race. I guess he's infected? How did that happen? Oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself. How the hell did that happen? Why and where did he get the super slugs (oh yes  they use the old sci-fi stand by of parasitic aliens/demons which \""fuse\"" with the spine of their host)Of course  Slater is  like Blade  half super-slug powered  but his slug \""didn't fully fuse due to an electrical shock \"" thank god. Oh  and the people with these \""fused\"" spines  have no idea they're half-alien/demon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies. Yeah we get zombies.So lots of crap that could be entertaining  but none of it is.Also  the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place...at least nothing a little dynamite can't handle.Not the very worst thing you'll see  but a truly bad movie.\twhat an awful movie. the acting was terrible  and tara reid's pants were too small. The costume design was almost as miserable as the camera work. And oxymoronic quotes such as \""once you make it down here alive you're already dead\"" can be found. It really makes very little sense. The special effects are lame. The acting is poor. The plot is pathetic and borderline nonexistent. There was a random part where it switched into hyper-video-game mode and I felt like I was watching a sequence from the game. The score selected did not fit at all with the movie. It was totally lame movie. Don't waste your time on it..................................................................\ti'm the kind of person who can enjoy some pretty bad movies  always finding something in it to make my night enjoyable... but this movie is beyond bad  on so many levels  in so many ways  it's a horror of horrible movie-making... even with some well known names  Christian slater  stephen dorff  and tara reid  i could only feel so bad for them  for they will forever be marked by this massively terrible garbage... the dialogue is so poor  you wonder just how the writers could possibly get work anywhere... a grade school film class would have better dialogue... (no offense to grade school kids)... it's so bad i kept sighing constantly  wondering if i could continue to watch it... it was physically painful to hear lines like  \""check the perimeter\""  or \""looks like a dead end  i'll go check it out\"".. maybe i should just kill myself and end the suffering quickly... the special effects are typical TV sci-fi fare  the creatures are very unoriginal  the background music is incredibly annoying  and the movie is exactly 95 minutes too long  as one minute would be the most any sane person could handle... i guess the only thing this movie could be good for  is at a party  where everyone can take turns making fun of every single bad scene... i sort of got two impressions about this movie.. either  some very young video-gaming pimple faced kid received a huge inheritance from a dead rich uncle  and decided to make their own movie  of which the kid has no movie making skills whatsoever  and will never have.. he just had the money... or  the movie was not created by a human at all  it's the latest AI software  that used mathematical formulas for creating dialogue  music  lighting effects  plot  and casting... if that was true  i'd at least give it that much.. but alas  i was only hoping for an excuse for this mess... this was truly one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my entire life...\tI have to admit the movie isn't good. It's an average movie that is watchable... Being this a game inspired movie  it's not a \""look it's just the same thing as the game\"" movie. Something being inspired by other doesn't necessarily mean it's a by-the-book translation... The important thing in a movie being inspired by a game is to have  at least  the feeling or the story (or both) of the game  in the movie... Having that said...I think the character of edward carnby could have been better accomplished than what it was  and I think that the spirit  the feeling  of the game wasn't truly there... I think this tries to resemble the most with the survival horror/puzzle action feeling of the AitD 4  not grasping some key stuff of the game... I think uwe boll only looked at some of the characteristics of the game like the creatures being afraid of the dark and stuff like that and translated directly to the movie  not thinking of the why it was there and the feeling of the previous aitd games and the background of edward...The acting was poor  not because of the actors I think  but mainly because of stuff like... Putting glasses in a woman doesn't make her a scientist!The story had some good points and the action sequence against the swarm of xenomes was averagly directed. I think that the worst of the story was the way it was directed... And I think that the love scene was completely misplaced/unnecessary... I think that it's one of those \""this has horror in the movie genre name so we must provide a love scene\"" case.It's a movie with poor acting  some good points in the storyline  mostly bad directed  with some good ideas in the action sequences but not well conducted... I still think that the movie is watchable with friends  even with those flaws  being this a completely average movie with no inovation.Also I have a comment to make... I have seen many people bashing on Tara Reid... Sometimes when the acting isn't good or great the fault isn't solely in the actor... If we'd put Kenneth Brannagh in a role of a \""Ed wood film\"" character  than I think must of us would go \""What the hell?\"" and think Kenneth couldn't act to save is life  when that's an false assumption... Not because of the story  but because of the director... It's like a sports team... More than 50% is due to the coach... Also Sean Penn  that's one of today's en vogue and best actors  had the reputation of not being the best of actors  being an average actor  and with roles in movies such as \""The mystic river\"" that image shifted a much higher level. I think that tara reid has room for improvement and we shouldn't bash and actor/actress in a general case... Each movie is different... Just like Silvester Stallone... His role in Rocky I and Copland were  IMHO  played well...\tThere should be a rule that states quite clearly that movies like Resident Evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game  not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible. RE was a survival horror game  and a damn effective one at that  yet Paul WS Anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie to come along. Alone in the Dark is essentially the same kind of a spirit as Resident Evil  so of course  there is the slight hope the director will manage to have some piece of a brain enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie. Instead  Alone in the Dark just proves that there is no longer hope for video games becoming movies.The plot  despite the fact that it obviously isn't supposed to matter  is the largest of many problems with the movie. The movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important  as after a minute passes  the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest hitting the object closest to them. Then there's something about an orphanage  some artefacts  an ancient tribe  some bureaucracy and some demons  all of which get so jumbled together that the viewers really can't follow with what is going on. Characters move in and out of the plot like candy  some having huge build-ups for meaningless deaths. Basically  what I can understand is that some demons got released  and Edward Carnby (Slater) has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him. He finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an ex-girlfriend anthropologist (Reid)  who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason. Then  out of nowhere  all hell breaks loose  and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander (Dorff)  who apparently has a mutual hatred for Carnby.It's all ridiculous  and the reason I don't really understand it isn't just because it's complicated and jumbled  but it leaves no room for anyone to really care. Instead  I highly recommend that  if you must see this film  bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion.The action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little  right? Too bad  this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made  with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens. Considering that this is based on a horror game  not an action game  it is especially annoying.The first action scene involving a man chasing Cranby from a taxi is among the worst I have ever had to witness  and the rest isn't all that great either. The demons look somewhat cool  though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect. Scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict. It's all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night.The acting is what I like to call taking actors and making them do nothing. Slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie  though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on. The same is true of Dorff  who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent (something that has happened to him a lot). Reid is pretty much exactly what she should be  background sex appeal  as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster (as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning).In all  this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies. If they keep ruining the spirit like this  it's only a matter of time before Samus Aran is killing Middle-Easterns with an AK-47 and Tommy Vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens. Unlike Resident Evil  however  this one doesn't deserve a second chance  as I don't think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is. It's bland  uninteresting and unexciting. This is the movie equivalent of diarrhea; it's all thrown together  nothing really fits and  in the end  you're just glad it's over.TOTAL: 4%\tAlone in The Dark is one of my favorite role-playing-games of all time. I remember spending whole nights facing the PC screen  trying to escape that mansion and actually being startled at times when monsters came surprisingly charging in. Now  mind you - I am weary of \""computer-game-generated\"" movies. I don't remember a single success story in this new Hollywood genre  although some are entertaining enough to be watchable. And yet  I am such a big fan of the game that I couldn't resist. My rationale was that if the movie had a plot that so much as resembled the game's  it would be OK. Man  those were 90 minutes (which seemed like 300) of my life that I'll never get back. If I had that chance  I would have gladly spent them rearranging my sock drawer instead. This isn't even in the \""so bad it's funny\"" category. You would think even Christian Slater had a bit more sense than joining this stink bomb. Now  Tara Reid... I'm not complaining about her presence. However  if the purpose of putting this chick in a starring role is to have a sex scene  - which I totally understand and support (hey  I'm a guy!) - I've seen more of her body on press conferences.There is no plot to speak of. Won't waste your time pitching it to you. The credibility of the story sinks below 'I did not have sex with Ms. Lewinski'. The acting is but a few notches above 'Street Fighter'  which  by the way  being one of the worst movies I've seen  I would recommend OVER this one.Kids  I recommend the Video Game. It has far better story  acting and much more thrills. As for the movie  here's a spoiler - it STINKS! Wait for the porno version.\tI give this movie a full ten stars due to the hilarity of its directors commentary  not because of any quality in the film (for there is none). When my brother rented House of the Dead  after his appalled viewing he watched it with the directors commentary to see \""what the hell the director was thinking\"". And the commentary was better than the movie. So now we rent this guy's stuff just to laugh our asses off with his idiotic musings.He actually believes that his movies are works of art!! You'll giggle uncontrollably when you watch Alone in the Dark (and any other Uwe Boll movie) with the commentary. He refers to his ending as \""Lynchian\"" (for a reason that the viewer--nor  apparently  the director--can explain. He constantly makes fun of Tara Reid and complains that she doesn't take off her bra. He refers to every shamelessly ripped off sce"
Bad News Bears (2005),"Billy Bob Thornton pulled off what no one other then the late Walter matthau could do  and that's play failed baseball player Morris Buttermaker to a bunch of rag tag kids. The script does great service to it's much needed updates from the 70's(including Amanda going from selling maps to working in a vintage clothing store)  to modern times work great  with out losing the effects of the original. The barbs trading back between Amanda and Buttermaker are funny  as THornton has a great screen chemistry with his younger co star. Not suing Kelly Leak in the original  and not having the classic Rudy Stein characters are a few of the drawbacks as is not using Amhad's hank Arron loving character (this time around Admand's favorite player is Mark McGwire  who the producers decided correctly to make a punchline) but the biggest drawback is Greg Kinnear as the Yankee's coach. Years removed from battling Ben Stiller to pull off the worst performance in the 1998 crapfest Mystery Men  Kinnear is stiff  not believable  and pretty much close to effeminate. kinnear almost pulls the whole movie down by himself with his wooden performance. While no one can even touch the late Vic Morrow's portrayal in 76  Kinnear's performance in terrible  and him being casted in the role is outright unacceptable. Tanner Boyle was thankful toned down from the 1976 classic  and is no longer spoutting racist words. He still manages   however  to be the team's badass with a mouth that would make sailor's blush. And he's absolutely funny at it as well  and is perhaps acting talent on the Bears roster. Worth the price of admission  and don't buy the hype  the girl that plays Amanda does a fine job in her own right.\tIf you saw and enjoyed the original  don't waste your time with this fair re-make. Other than Billy Bob in the lead role  there wasn't much else in this one to make it worth seeing. If there were no original  I probably would have thought more of this one......trouble is  there was.Tatum O'Neal was more likable than Sammi Kraft in the role of Amanda Whurlitzer. Vic Morrow was more believable than Greg Kinnear and so on and so forth. In the original  I actually found myself rooting for the Bears but in this one  they weren't a group of kids that I cared anything about.Just rent Bad Santa and you'll pretty much get the role that Thornton plays.\tBAD NEWS BEARS (2005) **1/2 Billy Bob Thornton  Greg Kinnear  Marcia Gay Harden.Serviceable \u0096 yet play-by-play \u0096 remake of the '70s comedy classic.Remakes are such a tricky creature in the cinematic world. Why bother remaking something that has an audience that loves the original in the first place is the $64 000 question most average filmgoers would be saying aloud and I'm hard-pressed to disagree? If it ain't broke  why fix it? But if you are going to do it  perhaps you should I dunno make it better?In the latest Hollywood misgivings about damn-to-hell-what-the-audience-wants-let's simply-recycle-a-hit-from-the-past-and-worry-about-the-conseque nces-later offering the result is a practically serviceable yet play-by-play 'safe' remaking of the comedy classic that starred the lovably gruff  messed-bed persona of the beleaguered Walter Matthau in all his schlumpy glory as the grizzled  beer-drinking never-was of a big-league ballplayer reduced to cleaning swimming pools in sunny Southern California musing about his one time only appearance in the majors while managing a ragtag little league ball team of misfits  losers and foul-language spewing tykes which unearthed a new sports themed subgenre: the pathetic team of misfits  losers and foul-language spewing tykes which have been seen in everything from THE MIGHTY DUCKS to the recent REBOUND with its pedestrian scripts and bathroom humor that has run stale since the original BEARS' first unworthy sequel!Well now indie cum Hollywood darling Richard Linklater (SCHOOL OF ROCK  DAZED AND CONFUSED) comes equipped with a faithful yet raunchy enough screenplay by BAD SANTA scribes Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who manage to update the Bill Lancaster script and Michael Ritchie's direction with enough pallid political incorrectness (except for one glaring omission in one of the lines spoken by the most foul player  Tanner Boyle (which I'm going to do likewise in fear of rebuttal; yeah  that's the times we live in folks  but dammit the line is funny and it's a JOKE!) and sexual humor to make the most hardened go-figure curmudgeon chuckle.Thornton fills Matthau's shoes as Morris Buttermaker  a drunken ex-ball player who is now an exterminator here but still a souse with a lousy demeanor  who is coerced by an attorney child-rights activist named Liz Whitehood (the sexy Harden) and an undisclosed check to coach the Bears  the worst team ever assembled (thanks to the political correctness we know have an Indian nerd and a chubby kid in a wheelchair rounding out the token black kid  two Mexican brothers and the fat kid whose on Atkins and not a junk food junkie).Buttermaker enlists the aid of Amanda Whurlitzer (Sammi Kraft)  a tweener pitching sensation he knew from his ill-fated relationship with her mom  when he realizes the kids really deserve more than the shellacking they received in their debut to the much-hated rivals  the Yankees led by Roy Bullock (Kinnear substituting yuppie weaseldom from Vic Morrow's gruff general bullying) who wants Buttermaker to take a hike.Also tacked on is grungy trouble making Kelly Leak (Jeff Davies) who Bullock can't stomach but proves to be a true athlete in power-hitting and displaying a keen touch for the outfield to boot as Buttermaker suddenly realizes the Bears may actually have a shot at the championship title.The film pretty much stays fast and loose but connect-the-dots similar to its original (even in an uncanny shot-by-shot of Leak's batting practice homer gliding into an actual game!) Not necessarily a bad thing but even though the screenwriters give Buttermaker a more active sexual life (sporting a bodacious babe here and there and even taking the kids to Hooters for a post-game celebration is inspired) it makes one wonder where it could've gone had they gone the R-rated route (which frankly the original came close to skirting as well). Thornton's sardonic Southern fried delivery is priceless \u0096 he's more chicken-fried steak than Matthau's salisbury and elicits enough contempt to distill the easily found treacle bubbling below (making the kids into winners) and Linklater  a personal fave of mine  seems to have found a unique niche: making kid films adult friendly.While it isn't an instant classic like the first flick \u0096 I blame that for the frankly carbon copies of the kids shown here \u0096 to wit  Tatum O'Neal actually emoted as Amanda in the '76 version! - (hell the Tanner kid looks and sounds just like the first one's! it's scary!) but they seem to be having a ball. Not a homer but more like a ground rule double that had triple written all over it.\tI think everyone who has seen this movie would agree with me  Billy Bob was the only good aspect to this film. The kids were terrible at acting  they made it seem like they were reading off a teleprompter the whole time. There were very few funny lines  and the kids seemed like nothing but potty mouth little brats.The original is way better  the performance I saw by Walter Matthau in the original got me very excited because Billy Bob always plays a good drunk  but in this film Billy Bob was just too nice most of the time  so his character was a little too dull. If you enjoy baseball films then you might enjoy this  but I doubt even the biggest Billy Bob fan would give this 2 thumbs up...\tThe \Bad News Bears\"" remake serves its purpose but don't think that it's any improvement over the original. Thornton is excellent and some of the new additions (such as the crippled Matt Hooper) add some new elements to the movie. However  some of the best parts of the original are either toned down or left out  including the classic \""Kelly Leak's one bad mother\"" scene (which is one area where the original script should have been followed 100%). The worst part of the movie in comparison with the 1976 version are the parts of Amanda Wurlitzer and Kelly Leak. These two characters are not performed nearly as well as in the original  especially the pivotal role of Amanda. However  the movie is still very enjoyable and worth seeing if you're a fan of the 1976 film.\tSo many laughs  so much fun to watch. The audience applauded once. Theater was packed.Didn't want the movie to end. It was TERRIFIC!!!!!Billy Bob and comedy fit like a glove. Subplots galore. Raunchy but riotous.A must see . . . Again and again.Ready for Bad News Bears 3. Bring it on!!The kids tried to steal the show from Billy Bob but he held his ground.The running joke about Greg Kinear's tight pants was great.Marsha Gay's character added just enough sex and not too much.\tThe original is sooooooooo much better! The jokes were better  the kids were better actors  Walter Mauthau is a much better Buttermaker...Billy Bob just made the role sleazy and unsympathetic. It was much more shocking back in the 70's also...now the humor just seems crass and sleazy. All the magic from the first one was absent in this one. It seems like they were trying way too hard to copy the original and somehow got lost  ending up with a dud of a movie. Why mess with a good movie anyway? It's like trying to remake Grease...you just can't do it. Just an overall BAD remake. 1/10.Skip this one; see the original instead.\tThe movie was a remake  so I went in there expecting a letdown. I am the kind of guy that wants some things to remain the same  forget the times. I thought they did some good things by not having Roy (the Yankees manager)smack Joey (his kid) on the mound. It IS 2005  and you just can't show something like that. Or the Bears drinking REAL beer at the end...I accept that too. But there are some things that didn't ring true to me.Why did they make Kelly #5 in the movie? That stole something important away from me and all the other fans. That final inning  he comes up and is announced  that's one of the great moments of anticipation in sports movie history. You KNOW he is swinging away anyway  and that announcement makes you realize who he is...How good he is...How IMPORTANT this at-bat is...But they get the number wrong. Several numbers were wrong  but this one is the most glaring.Tanner Boyle  as expected  doesn't use the same colorful curses as in the original. In a PC world  it's expected that he would be a little more tame...But ANYONE that saw the original and Bears II knows that Tanner can NOT be tame because he is the epitome of attitude. To \""water-him-down\"" is a gross injustice  and he should have been a foul-mouthed little bastard that fought more people than just Engleberg. He kept going after him  and not the whole team. They could not have let him be the original  agreed  but why did he play second base? Tanner is the SHORTSTOP  which is the perfect irony because he is terrible and his position is the most vital in the infield for a team that faces so many right-handed batters.There is no Albert/Alfred Ogilvie. The brain of the team  the scout  the first one to get on base with 2-outs in the last inning of the championship. That weird Armenian kid played a sort-of-afterthought role  but it is BS. The little speech of being \""0-14 and next to Timmy Lupus  probably the worst player in the league\"" was gone from the movie. The time it was delivered in the original was DETRIMENTAL to the plot  and showed the comeback with the proper perspective. Ahmed didn't bunt  some weird new kid did...Little Miguel is supposed to walk because of his size...Um  where was that? Kelly is supposed to bat last  with the bases juiced and 2 away. Why is that Armenian kid hitting there? Kelly slapping a hit earlier in inning and being on-base is like the end of Bears II  but that Armenian kid is no Carmen Ronzonni  let alone Kelly Leak. The Armenian  Aztec  Argentinian  African  whatever he is kid should be on the cutting room floor.Timmy Lupus making stupid statements...He eats poop I think I heard...What have they DONE to the underdog hero? He was a quiet  shy kid that had a moment. He isn't even a boogie-eating moron now  he eats poop and is too weird to be a factor in the hearts of any viewers. If I were Quinn Smith  I'd try to sue BIG TIME. Anyways  he doesn't even get to make the catch to redeem himself. He misses that too  and this WHEELCHAIR kid Hooper makes it. I get it  Hooper=Looper  Gay for the pun...Yank  yank on my lower extremity. A wheelchair...OK  it was funny...But you stole the glory from Lupus. He has no respect from the viewing public now.Hooper should have been named Ogilvie  and played that role. Let him bat in the sixth  and get walked when a ball hits his chair or something...Then he hits super-speed on his chair or something and scores on Ahmed's bunt after stealing a base or two...The girl that played Amanda has boobs. Couldn't they cast a flat girl with some ANGER in her acting to play the Bears ace? This kid had no spunk  no attitude  no talent for acting. And the bra line was lost because of her body. Period line? Cheap replacement.I did like the ending parts between Buttermaker and Amanda  them being friendly and maybe a bit tender. Better way to see them ride into sunset...Although the dugout scene with her arm in ice was lacking  considering what they couldn't or wouldn't say in this day and age. Kelly and Amanda kiss...BULL. A terrible thing. Since she won't be in a sequel (BETTER NOT BE  DON'T MESS THE SERIES UP MORE )why tease us? There are so many other problems I have with this movie  but there is not enough time or space to list them all. Yeah  I'll buy it on DVD when it comes out to add to my COMPLETE sports movie collection...But I guarantee it will remain sealed. I wouldn't let anyone that saw the original poison their eyes with it.The thing that makes me most angry though  is the fact that in 10 years or so  I'll be telling my kid or some kid (I coach baseball actually) about how anyone can make a great play. I'll bring up the Bears and say Timmy Lupus or something  and the kid will say \""the kid in the wheelchair?\"" Or after a loss  I'll say that some calls are just wrong...Like Kelly in the last at-bat  and they will argue and say it was some Armenian kid. I hate that most kids growing up today won't see or know about the original movie. This piece of crap is all they will know  and it is just WRONG to pass this off as the same. It misses a lot of detrimental parts that shaped the movie  and lines that should never be forgotten. RESCREEN the original in theaters for us  that would be fair. The movie would kick ass these days  and great ratings. Do it and make a fortune  as well as cool me off.\tthis movie had a lot going for it  Billy Bob Thorton and Richard Linklater. But the lame jokes and the recycled plot made it just another dumb remake. Billy Bob's performance was so strained it looked like he was doing a bad impression of himself from \""Bad Santa. There was a few funny moments but not from the main star  but from his younger supporting cast. The young cast managed to upstage Thorton by spinning out vulgar and disgusting jokes that actually make you laugh. There's a good side plot with Thorton and his daughter that brings a dramatic side to the film. Overall  unless you want to spend money to watch a so so comedy go watch Wedding Crashers instead.\tI gave the remake a 6. I consider the original a 9 or 10. As a kid the original BNB was as close to the actual Little League experience one could get. Growing up in the 70's and seeing the original as a kid has over the years  made me appreciate the original BNB more and more over the years. Tanner is one of my favorite characters in moviedom.The new version while staying very close to the original  has none of the spirit of the old classic. All of the actors fail to live up to any of the original's grit and toughness. The new Tanner is a joke. He looks like Tanner  speaks like Tanner  acts like Tanner  but he is not Tanner. Same goes for everyone except for maybe the Timmy Lupis character. He was passable. Billy Bob was and still is the only choice to play Buttermaker  but even he can't pull this one off. There is just no reason for remaking this classic.The kid in the wheel chair was just ridiculous.Why?\tI seem to be the only one (on IMDb  at least) who thinks so  but I felt that this film was a minor masterpiece. Granted  I haven't seen the original version  so  you know  everything I say is suspect  blah blah blah. I just thought that the film was astonishingly well-directed  that they didn't wuss out on the cursing or the sexual stuff  that it had a good message  and that the film was painfully realistic. I mean  have you ever been to a Little League game? It's horrifying.If you will permit me to digress a little  I once saw a man at a Little League game holding an umbrella. It was raining  obviously  but the players were still playing  including the umbrella man's presumably older son  since the fellow was sitting next to his younger one. The tinier kid tried to grab the umbrella from Daddy  or possibly just move it closer to his own body; I'm not entirely sure (I was sitting behind them). Anyway  Kid grabs the umbrella  and Pa  apparently mad at something  grabs the kid's hand and SLOSHES ALL THE DAMN WATER OFF THE UMBRELLA AND ONTO THE KID'S FACE! Kid starts crying  and POPS SAYS IT'S HIS FAULT! What a horrid jerk!Anyway  the Bad News Bears is a damn good movie regardless of its remake status  and I encourage everyone to go see it  because it really is a superlative example of American popular film-making.\tI really hope that the production crew fired the boom operator for raiding Buttermaker's beer box. Nearly every scene has the boom mike visible in it and one scene even had part of the other equipment (camera lens/shadow box) visible for the entire scene. And if it's not bad enough to see the black mike hanging overhead like the sword of Damocles  they dropped the mike with the sheepskin on it into one scene  reminding me of someone holding Albert Einstein by his ankles over the scene. One close up scene of one of the kids had the mike just inches from his head...I would have been nervous  myself. And in reference to the filthy mouths of the kids (and realizing that not everyone has my sense of values) I personally think the parents of these little sailors should have been punished for child abuse  as well as the crew who made them talk that way. And someone please--get a sheep-shearer in here for Tanner's 'hair'...that was the worst wig I've EVER seen on a human.\tOn the \""shot-by-shot-remake-o-meter \"" on which the Vince Vaughn \""Psycho\"" is a 10  I'd rate this about a 7.5  somewhere around \""Point of No Return\""/\""La Femme Nikita.\"" I thought Billy Bob Thornton was well-cast  and all the kids did great jobs. But in revisiting this classic  I think the filmmakers missed an opportunity  especially considering that original screenwriter Bill Lancaster got to pen this version.The charm of the original movie  for me  was the unvarnished realism with which it depicted childhood. I was about the age of the original Bears kids  and scene after scene rang true -- especially the fight at the hot dog stand. Even with the dramatic flourishes that distinguish every film from real life  that movie really conveyed what it felt like to be a grade school kid in 1976.The remake also does a good job... of conveying what it's like to be a 1976 grade-school kid. I've got nephews that age who play ball  and their lives are different from my own childhood in countless ways. But the new movie settles for superficial updates: Amanda bets Kelly over a skateboard maneuver  not air hockey. The bookish kid has a laptop instead of a scorebook. One of the kids is Armenian  and another is disabled  so the \""motley bunch\"" construct is a little more au courant. Swell. But Tanner still has his 1976 hair  and the presence of two Spanish-speaking kids in southern California is still presented as a notable occurrence.More importantly  all the themes are the same. If they had really cracked this one open and reworked it on a deeper level  they could have come up with new approaches that would resonate for years with the kids of today  like the original did for me. I don't know if today's kids will see themselves in this movie.The most substantive update -- Marcia Gay Harden as the adult Whitewood character  instead of a man -- leads to a subplot that involves the adults almost exclusively  and is completely abandoned.The remake is watered down in ways that are not surprising  in terms of Tanner's invective and Roy Bullock's treatment of his son on the mound. But the power of those original elements isn't replaced by anything; it's just missing.Finally  a little generational boosterism. Jackie Earle Haley was a waaayy badder badass as the original Kelly Leak.I don't have the blanket disdain for remakes that I'm seeing elsewhere on IMDb  and I did find this film to be entertaining and enjoyable. But it could have been so much more than it was. Perhaps the best thing about its release is that it has stimulated showings of the original on cable TV.\tI think I'm going to go shopping for a file cabinet this weekend. I've been meaning to get my life more organized  and I figured it'd be a good idea to start filing things. I'll pick up several folders as well  and I'll be sure to label one \""Unnecessary Wastes of my Time.\"" Under \""U\"" of course. And while I'm at it  I think I'll go ahead and make \""Remake of The Bad News Bears\"" the first entry I file.I actually expected to be fairly entertained by this movie  so I was quite shocked by how pedestrian it is. Billy Bob Thornton as an alcoholic Little League baseball coach? Come on  that's gotta be pretty funny  right? Well  you'd think. But strangely enough  Thornton is quite subdued  and apparently the writers thought it'd be absolutely hilarious if they made the kids raunchier than Thornton. Perhaps the writers could use a course on how to more effectively think things through.I never dismiss a movie immediately just because it's a remake. I always give it a chance to stand on its own merits. Unfortunately  this is a remake that seems content with touching all the main plot points from the original  and then just making the kids cuss more. Sorry  but I fail to see the humor in 11 year olds running around saying God-d**n and the like. Har har har  yeah  there's some crisp screen writing there. If I see an 11 or 12 year old using that kind of language in real life I can't help but think it's a punk who hasn't been taken to the woodshed enough. I certainly don't cheer them on. Same thing with the kids in this movie.I'm all for a good underdog story  but this is one of the least inspiring underdog movies I've ever seen. I was actually rooting against the Bears. Talk about the biggest collection of annoying kid actors I've seen in a long time  especially Tanner (Timmy Deters). It's bad enough that his stupid girly hair makes him look like a young Natalie Maines  but his taste for the profane and penchant for getting into fights indicate to me that he's just going to be another drain on taxpayer money when he's sitting in a jail cell in a few years. He's a prime example of why you shouldn't spare the rod.The movie also tries way too hard to attempt to be controversial without being all that offensive. For example  the uniforms are sponsored by Bo Beeps strip club. This doesn't offend me so much as it insults my intellect due to the fact that it's just not very funny. \""Haha  look at how irreverent we are! This is edgy stuff! We have now thusly taken the kids to dine at Hooters! Bow at our over-the-top vulgarity!\"" Um  I'm not too impressed. \""Well you should be! Fine  we will henceforth throw in another instance of a child using a curse word! That shall surely induce fits of laughter!\"" Not really.\""Oh  well  then we shall have Billy Bob say such taboo things as  'This is not a democracy! It's a dictatorship  and I'm Hitler!\"" Woo  yeah  that's really crossing the line there. Nice try. Maybe if you have a sequel you can replace \""Hitler\"" with \""Stalin\"" or \""Hussein\"" and REALLY cross the line. Good job  guys  you've got some ready-made quotes just sitting in the queue.Give me a break. Billy Bob does have his moments  and he's obviously the funniest thing the movie has going for it  but at times the movie seems like an awkward attempt at letting him just monologue in an effort to come up with a memorable one-liner. After each failed attempt he's allowed to keep going  as if we're being treated to a deleted rehearsal scene or something. \""The audience didn't laugh? OK  let's try another...\"" Oh  and let me get back to the kids for a second - for the most part they're all really bad actors. Especially Sammi Kraft and Jeff Davies. I know they didn't have previous acting experience  but sheesh  it sticks out like Paris Hilton at a virgin convention. I started to feel embarrassed watching Ms. Kraft trying to spit out a simple line like  \""You. are. a. lazy. drunk.\"" My sister thought she recognized the girl and asked me  \""Where else have I seen her?\"" I responded with  \""Not acting school.\"" And poor Jeff Davies - sure  he can hit a baseball  but he looks like Corey Feldman going through an awkward stage of puberty  and his line delivery is just as unemotional as Ms. Kraft's. I just didn't buy him as the bad boy that Jackie Earle Haley portrayed so well in the original. It's not often that I'm actually shocked by truly bad acting in a big screen release  so congrats  Bad News Bears! You've got that going for you! After about 35 minutes  when I realized this just wasn't going to be a very funny movie  I decided to start counting how many times we were expected to laugh at dropped fly balls  booted grounders  turd jokes  and the kids insulting each other and getting into fights. After I had exhausted all 10 fingers within the course of about 5 minutes I decided to just give up  lean back in my seat  and ride it out. T'wasn't easy  especially since this inexplicably lasts almost two hours  but I survived.Whenever Billy Bob announces who the Bears will be playing next he asks them what that means for the opposing team. The players yell out  \""Bad news!\"" How ironic that the same mantra can be applied to what you can expect if you fork out your hard-earned dough to see this on the big screen.\tIf you think that bad taste is funny...be ready to laugh your butt off. This is not to be confused with the Walter Matthau Bad News Bears of 1976. Watching this team of misfits is somehow refreshing. Morris Buttermaker(Billy Bob Thornton)  a former major league pitcher who saw 2/3 of an inning in the big leagues  is hired by Liz Whitewood(Marsha Gay Harden)to coach her son and a group of little league rejects. Butterworth  currently working as an exterminator; drinks beer constantly  chain smokes cigars and doesn't particularly like children; but reluctantly takes on the job of coaching these talent-challenged kids. A thorn in Buttermaker's side is the coach(Greg Kinnear) of the returning champions. To the rescue comes his estranged daughter(Sammi Kraft)and a neighborhood tough guy(Jeff Davies). Thornton is hilarious as the grousing coach. Nobody could play this role any better. And impressive is Kraft  who was discovered in a public park and reportedly can throw a 72 mph fastball. Crude  rude and a whole lot of fun to watch.\tThe Bad News Bears  is a remake of the 1976 film of the same name. The film is about an alcoholic exterminator named Morris Buttermaker  who agrees to coach a youth baseball team basically for the money. When he first meets the team he realizes that they do not know how to play baseball at all so he tries to get them into shape to win the championship game. To help him do this he recruits his daughter Amanda (from a previous marriage)  who he has not seen in years and a troublesome motorcycle rider named Kelly. Coaching one of the rival teams is Roy Bullock  a coach who is obsessed about winning. With the bursts of anger and alcohol problem the kids will have to get used to Morris  and he will have to get used to the troublesome kids as well. This remake of The Bad News Bears  is by Richard Linklater  who is one of my favourite modern day directors and after a bunch of cult and independent films this is his third mainstream film after The Newton Boys (which I have never seen)  and The School Of Rock. The film also stars Billy Bob Thornton  who I thought was very good in such films as Sling Blade  and Bad Santa. With a good director and good actor I thought this film would be pretty good but it isn't. The character of Morris Buttermaker  is very similar to Billy Bob Thornton's character Willie in the film Bad Santa  and in some ways the film is a lot like Bad Santa (so seeing as two of the screen writers did Bad Santa  is not surprising). The film tries to deliver the same type of rude and profane jokes that worked wonderfully in Bad Santa  but makes the jokes a lot tamer for a PG-13 audience and they just don't work. They almost feel like rejected jokes from Bad Santa. And the film didn't do a whole lot for me and it was fairly predictable and in a lot of ways you could see where the movie was going. I have not seen the original 1976 version of The Bad News Bears  but I'am a person who strongly dislikes remakes and does not think that they are necessary at all. This is a remake that probably didn't have to be made because it falls flat soon and not even the talent of Richard Linklater  or Billy Bob Thornton can bring it back to life. A big disappointment from both these talents.\tI don't know about the rest of you  but I found the New Bad News Bears to be absolutely hysterical. Yeah  there were some spots that were funnier than others  but I still left the theater with pains in my stomach and hips from laughing so hard.Many people lately have been complaining over this summer of Remakes  and I have sometimes been one of them  but I found that this Bad News Bears did what a remake should do: update a classic to reach a new audience without insulting the integrity of the original. Many of the same characters are included in this film  and several scenes from the original Bears have simply been reinserted into the remake.Billy Bob is great  once again channeling is Bad Santa attitude as Coach Buttermaker  and easily steals the beginning of the picture. Soon  much like the original  the bad attitudes of the kids come into play  and the humor comes directly from the various Bears. Tanner is still the funniest  and many of the characters are different from the original  including a whe"
Batman Begins (2005),"Well  maybe not so much a prequel as it is \the way things should have been\"". While most fans of the \""Bat-Man\"" (as the original comic was titled) know about how his parents were killed  this film finally shows how Bruce Wayne evolved into the Caped Crusader  complete with his own version of \""Q\"" (I always wondered if he created his gadgets himself; now we know that they came from Lucius Fox). Casting was excellent; Michael Caine as Alfred was inspired  and he plays the part both with charismatic charm and with a deep empathy for Bruce Wayne and his demons. I didn't check out the cast list fully before seeing the movie  and I kept telling myself that the actor playing the young James Gordon looked really familiar... has Gary Oldman ever played a good guy before this? Hopefully they will continue to use him in the sequels (of course there will be those!) so we can see his eventual rise to police commissioner.It was great to see how human the man behind the mask is... that is something that Val Kilmer and George Clooney could not come across with (Michael Keaton did a better job of portraying Bruce Wayne as a tortured soul  but not was well as Bale did).And while I'm not a Bat addict  wasn't one of the villains named \""Scarecrow\"" in the comic? Wonder if using that in this movie is an indication of things to come.\tBATMAN BEGINS The title of this film proves to be an interesting choice. It encompasses in two words the full intentions of the film's developers  whose ultimate goal was to revive a potentially lucrative franchise that audiences left for dead years ago. Unfortunately  it also foreshadows an aimless  lackluster narrative that manages a few  fresh breathes during its otherwise mediocre  two-and-a-half hour journey. Ultimately  the film fails to entertain.This failure is most apparent in its attempt to bring the two worlds of its hero together. On the one hand is Bruce Wayne's world  which occupies the daylight hours of society; the other world  of course  is assigned to Batman  who occupies the night. These two identities make up the overall identity of the film's hero  who really deserves the overall name of Batman  as that character is what interests us most.The makers of this film must know this themselves: this is  after all  a Batman film  and this is what the audience expects to see. The film they made  however  does not reflect this knowledge. True  the film spends a sizable amount of its time \u0096 and budget \u0096 covering the background of everything associated with the Batman mythos  such as how he fights  what inventions he uses  and how he develops his reputation as a caped crusader. Yet through it all  the character of Batman eludes us  even when he is obviously present on-screen.Something is missing from this film  and its lack is sorely felt throughout. Perhaps it's a sense of the majestic  of the truly heroic. For so much time is spent dissecting the various inventions and techniques that Bruce Wayne \u0096 not Batman yet  because the cowl is off \u0096 plans to employ  that once we see them in action  their use  and the way it all looks  is a matter of course. It is hard to be astounded by the result  because the method has been fully explained.This almost neurotic emphasis on the realism of Batman's kit is strange  especially when one considers that the principal character was conceived of decades ago  well before any of this technology even existed. Somehow  Batman managed to chase down villains  break crime syndicates  and even save the entire globe  without the use the film's high-tech gadgetry that would feel more at home in a James Bond effort.This reliance on contemporary technology is so acute  the actual character of Batman is left ill-defined. Thus  while we can understand how he jumps from a tall building  and floats to one a few stories below  we have no idea what kind of mettle a man has to made of to even consider making that leap. Nor do we know what truly drives him to stay up every night  risking his life in the pursuit of criminals  only to leave them at the mercy of a system that will most likely free them in a short time.A few answers are offered  and these are revenge for the death of his family; a wounded sense of injustice; and some dimes-store psychology about childhood fears. Yet these are only partial answers  and hardly suffice as explanations of Batman's character. Most people experience a sense of injustice at some point in their lives; but what is it about Batman's beliefs that distinguishes him from us  to the extent that he wears a costume  and chases down some of the most dangerous people in the city? Most people understand the concept of revenge; yet what is it about how is Batman's desire for revenge is so intense that he dedicates his entire life to fighting crime? The remaining characters in the film are equally offered half-baked  and hollow. The lower goons and villains Batman encounters in the film are scared witless by the merest hint of his presence  while the major antagonists of the film muster no greater reputation than that of a bully. Once Batman appears on the scene  they lose the tough coolness they exhibited in front of secondary characters  and revert to laughing  cackling crackpots that know little of strategy  and probably couldn't reason through the theft of a single candy bar. Gotham city is only briefly referred to  and even then  our knowledge is limited to that of dark  grimy streets  and a lot of pouring rain.With few likable  genuinely heroic characters  the film offers little purchase for the viewer to grab on to during its long-winded ride. The fact that  during this ride  very little happens  only adds to the sense of ennui. The flashback scene that occupies almost a full hour passes by in a montage of scenes that could have been taken from a mediocre kung fu flick; while the rest of the movie involves a hefty amount of the aforementioned gadgetry  and an ambitious  villainous plot that is introduced in a decidedly clumsy fashion.Perhaps that is a good term to describe the film's overall mood: it is clumsy. The film attempts to be a thoughtful  genre-defining origin story  for a character that has fascinated many for over half a century. In this effort it fails  instead attaining a mediocre status that is entirely due to an earnest cast  and an inflated  Hollywood budget.Does it Entertain? In a word  no. The film is long  and the story uneventful. The narrative is uninspired  and played out by actors who work their hardest  in roles that might as well be straitjackets. The heavy-handed exposition behind every gadget is tiresome  and succeeds only in tarnishing whatever lustre the action might have brought. This is a Batman movie in name  and look  only.\tI have to admit that I had really high expectations of this movie  Christian Bale was the perfect candidate to revive the Bat franchise  Christopher Nolan surely had something fresh to bring to the prequel (Joel Schumacher we will never forgive you).Overall this film looks great  if a tad bit depressing in places. Nolan does a perfect job of the performances  (Michael Caine  on excellent form  though a little underused....I thought). Sadly Nolan fails in the action department  and this lets the whole film down for me. When Batman kicks ass the fight scenes are poorly framed choppily edited and annoying to watch.A decent second unit director should have definitely been considered  I'm not asking for Yeun Wo Ping to bring in the strings  but having someone who knows how to frame a fight sequence would have helped.Many of the blockbusters have suffered this year because of poor action choreography. Revenge of the Syth looked great  but again George Lucas can not direct a decent lightsaber duel to save his life. The ultimate face off between Annakin and Obe would have been outstanding if George had of brought someone in who knew what they were doing  poor camera angles  missed opportunities  no sense of danger or struggle  (Samuel J we will forgive you  but you did look like a muppet  and yeeees!!! you did go out like a sucker!!!) To get back to Batman  I'm not slogging this movie off  I will be definitely adding this to my DVD collection  but why spend all that money on a good looking movie when the fight scenes look like they where done by the numbers. If this where my movie  I would be gutted pass off action sequences like that.8 out of 10  might have got 9.5 had the action delivered!!! Well done to everyone involved none the less Afterthought: what would this have been like had Tarrantino got his hands on it....we can only dream....\tyet again we have been treated to a true tour-De-force powerhouse movie that stands very tall with its head held high!!!!!! the only movies that have really got hold of me and given me a real sense of enjoyment (comic strip adaptations this is) is this and the x-men movies.BATMAN BEGINS the movie....the film starts with a young and innocent Bruce Wayne and its not long until you see why he ended up fearing bats they way he did and as the film progresses you get to see the reason why his parents are murdered and what affect this has on Bruce as he grows up full of hate and unforgivingness  as a result Bruce travels the globe in the hope that he will learn to understand the common criminal and therefore know how to combat them  and this is where he bumps into Liam Neeson who teaches him the ways of the ninja and other ways also in combating \""evil\"" and you can guess the rest. the trick to this film is that you don't get to see batman at all for about an hour and the wait is really worth it  you get the lot in this movie... humour  sharp serious dialogue  great action  great actors and acting... but again the only down side to this movie is that pesky camera work in the fight scenes and it really annoyed me and made me feel a little dizzy at times  but when you look at the film as a whole you do tend to forgive this one and only discrepancy!!! he he..................9/10 for the film and would have been 10 but for the camera work.BATMAN/BRUCE WAYNE...where has this man been hiding he he  been a fan of bales for a wee while now and i was looking forward to him playing this  but i didn't realise how effective he would be  as the educated and mega rich teenager/business man he pulls this off with such a grizzly swagger and realistic charm you just have to love the guy...i am so glad that Christian bale was aloud to play the character as dark as he did  with so much conviction and because of this you really feel the hate/confusion that runs very deep through him........awesome! 10/10 for me!ALFRED the butler..... has Michael Caine ever been more suited to a character than Alfred??? i find it very hard to find any that come close  the only other one is probably peachy from \""the man who would be king) with Sean Connery  the humour is bang on and really delivers the dialogue with real exuberance and is a delight to watch  witty  sentimental  and has the look of a real butler you could believe to be......10/10 again.COMISSIONER GORDON.....it is very rare when you get a Gary Oldman performance so perfectly played down as this  if you are a regular at the cinema then you will have no problems identifying him but if you're not you could very easily miss him altogether. Gary plays Gordon as the typical family orientated policeman who is just trying to survive in what is a real crap hole of a city in \""Gotham city\"" where most of the cops are corrupt and the quality of people living there a quite unnerving to say the least.....you don't get the usual Gary Oldman here and just occasionally i would like to have seen just a little bit more of the actor i know and though i didn't get it i loved his character all the same......9/10 HENRI DUCARD/RHA'S AL GHUL.......Liam Neeson is consistently showing some REAL heavyweight performances in Hollywood at the moment and this is just another feather in that bow  for the first hour of the movie nearly all the best scenes had him in them  and was by far a better villain than any of the other batman villains in previous movies put together....this was a man with real issues and real hatred for corruption and lawlessness and his conviction in this movie made me go WOW on more than 1 occasion he he.....what a towering impression he gives when he is being forceful especially during the sword fighting scenes....awesome....apart from sounding a bit like Qui-Gon Jinn in some spots ( still sounded cool just too familiar if thats the right way of putting it) he was cock-on!! 9/10 MORGAN FREEMAN... though this guy is always Mr reliable he was never allowed to shine as much as you hope for in this  purely because his character isn't that big but what you do get you just know you like... he he.CHRIS NOLAN/ director....well  well  well! this is excellent directing  the pace of the movie is spot on  the feel he gives you with both the scenery and the dark harsh Gotham city is quite exquisite. you do get lots of shots at like side profile and the use of these angles with shadows over the faces and body positions give you the sense of that you are watching a very dark and gritty movie and right from the get go you know that this is never gonna be like the originals as we know them! the only gripe i have is the use of extreme close up camera work when you get the fights on the go  i know they want you to feel like you're in e the fight but by doing this you lose the beauty of the the action scene and choreography between the actors. because of this i will go 9/10 i hope this is useful to some people and i URGE YOU ALL TO SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE ITS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT......its much better!!\twho is batman? from now on it is without a doubt in my mind that Christian bale is the ultimate batman. i know this is shocking to hear as Micheal Keaton was moody  dark and superb but bale has something that no other screen batman had  the sense of rage  anger and the actually possibility of snapping emotionally like the original DC comics. Batman always seemed he could snap  and bale  an expert at psychological roles (american psycho  the machinist) actually looks like breaking down in parts of the film. but this film is not just about bale. Bow down to the king of creepy  Cillian Murphy. what a change from the scruffy git in 28 days later to the smirking and outright shocking scarecrow. the first time scarecrow appeared on screen the cinema sounds near threw me from my seat. personally  i can't wait to see him in red eye.then there is Micheal Caine  humorous  confident  great acting (as always) and for the first time relaxed. Alfred is not some posh pompous servant but a helper  an essential part of the team which was neglected in some of the earlier films. there are too many good performances in this film to mention  so i'll leave it with this  marvel have got their work cut out!!!! BALE!!!!\tI recently saw the movie and I was very satisfied with the result of Mr. Nolans work. Batman is one of the superheros which many people have a relationship to  and the expectations was(and still is) quite high. I think the producers and the directors have suceeded with the creation of a Batman who is up to date but at the same time the Batman we all know(dark minded and lonely). Further I will pay a huge tribute to the performance of Christian Bale. I have been fortunate to see this great actor in the past and my conclusion  after seeing Batman Begins  is that he is one of the best around. His ability to express different emotions is just great acting and with the costarring of Michael Caine  Liam Neeson  Gary Oldman  Morgan Freeman and Katie Holmes this has become one of the best superhero movies of all time. We can just hope for more.....\tI mostly wanted to see this movie because I wanted to see Katie Holmes  since I've never seen her before. She was very beautiful and pretty convincing in her role  though not enormously so. I don't think she's one of our top actresses  but she isn't terrible either.I thought the guy who played Batman wasn't very good looking. He has this peculiar  overly narrow nose & flattish face. Why him? His acting was pretty good  though.There was an awful lot of racing around in the movie  particularly in the bat-mobile. I found watching this a bit fatiguing.There were some positive parts of the movie. I particularly liked the guy who played the only executive at Wayne's company who is actually loyal to him. I also liked the Ninja training scenes.Overall it wasn't abysmal  but I don't know if it was the best way to spend a couple of hours of my time.\tBatman Begins is starting a new generation of Batman movies. This one if the best and it gave such a great beginning story to what happened to Bruce.Christian Bale gave a very good performance. He is a good Batman and I hope to see him continue with other Batman movies because he has proved himself to be one of the next leading Hollywood men in this time.The supporting cast was excellent too. Michael Caine gave a great performance as always as the Butler. He really brings energy to a movie.Morgan Freeman too is good as always but his part needed to be bigger. He is one of my favorite actors and I thought he was good in this movie too.Kate Holmes. She is another cute and sweet actress that I personally love to see in films. The not so good reviews First Daughter I thought was a good movie. She really has a potential too.Batman Begins is not to be missed. It is a good film and I am waiting for the next one! :)\tWhatever you think of Batman Begins  you kind of have to give more credit to X-Men and Spiderman for getting it right the first time. The execs at Warner Brothers have changed their minds over what they want to do with this superhero franchise of theirs that they go and retool it every two movies. So it's kind of disorienting watching this one  in ways good and bad. For one  I feel a little disappointed in the batmobile: it's more like a bat tank. Mainly  though  the story's a lot more complicated with its humongous cast of characters. If I didn't know any better  I'd guess there's a rule that anyone who's ever been nominated for an Oscar gets a coupon for a free role in a Batman movie that everyone's cashing in on (if you want to know the exact stats  which I hope you do because I spent 10 minutes researching this  5 actors in this movie have earned 12 Oscar nominations between them)  and they had to try extra hard to find parts for everyone.  which led to some characters who just didn't need to be there. Like Morgan Freeman  for example  is a scientist who designs Batman's gadgets. I love Morgan Freeman but what exactly is he doing there? Doesn't Q belong with James Bond? Also  who's the real villain? Aside from making the story confusing  I think part of the fun of Batman is that you have this whacked hero dressed up as a bat and then you have even wackier villains with themes of their own  like a guy who dresses like a Penguin or the Riddler. With the exception of the Scarecrow  this movie doesn't really have that here. Unfortunately  I didn't really see the scarecrow that much  anyway. I think the reason for adding someone like crime boss Carmone Falcone was to show us how bad of a place Gotham is. Now Tim Burton didn't ever need to resort to that. He created such a dark tone that he could show us what Gotham was just by showing us a frame of it. I will add  though  that most people who see this movie will probably agree that Commissioner Gordon and Alfred are both two really strong characters in this movie and they add a lot  unlike the other movies where they kind of stand around and look like idiots next to Batman. So  as I say  the story's different but as it stands on its own  it really works well. It had the same piecing-together-of-the-puzzle element that the Star Wars III prequels had  which is real cool. If you've watched any Batman TV episode or watched any Batman movie  then you can't help but be intrigued by a movie that answers the questions  where did Batman get the idea for Batman  how did he get the batmobile or the batcave  where did he learn to fight?  etc.\tWhere is Gotham City? I only ask because this movie makes you feel as if you could actually go there  as if it actually exists somewhere. I liked Tim Burton's Batman  but Christopher Nolan's vision is so well paced and so real  that it is  in my humble opinion  the first REAL Batman movie. Christian Bale brings Batman to life with all of the emotion of a real person  I guess it takes a real actor to do so. The supporting cast is a group of actors with so much character that they could have had there own movies. Alfred is awesome. So many great movies stumble some during their running time  but this one did not miss a step. 10 out of 10. I wonder if Bruce Wayne would give me a loan?\tThis Batman has a strong script and is very well directed while still dark it is also not as dark as the original by Tim Burton don't get me wrong Tim Burton has good moments even the new Willy Wonka is good but personally I like Christopher Nolan's version much more. While the stars Chritian Bale and Katie Holmes were one-sided even Liam Neeson was not as good as usual but the co-stars Michael Cane and Morgan Freeman were very good. But when Christian Bale put on the mask he looked like Batman but when it was off he was one-sided. The reason I give it an 8 is because of the acting besides that it was very well made. I hope this helpful or fun for you to read.I really enjoyed the movie I hope you like it. God Bless You p.s. if you do see it you should see it on the big screen.\tThis is one of the best movies of the year because there wasn't any corny action like in all the other Batman movies. The characters were more real than in the other movies  except for the Scarecrow. The other Batman movies had make-believe characters like the Penguin  Bane  Harvey Two-Face and all of those characters. This movie had a lot of action and it was the first movie with Batman flying. I thought the movie was exciting and also funny and it really deserves an Oscar for something since it was a decent movie. I think it will at least get nominated. This is the best movie of the year because it had good acting  directing  writing  and visual effects. I hope they make a Batman Continues with Harley Ouinn as the Joker.\tFirst of all  I want to tell you that I have been one of Batman's greatest fans since I started reading the comic books. Actually I discovered Batman before I started reading the comic books  which is not that strange because I was born in the year of 1989. When I was about eight years old  I watched the first Batman movie starring Michael Keaton. And yeah  I liked the humor in that movie a lot. I didn't like the second movie as much as I liked the first  but it was yet a great movie. But when I watched the third and fourth movies  which was after I started reading the comic books  I really disliked it. I couldn't understand why they wanted to make such two bad movies when Burton did good with the two first movies. Although Batman & Robin was a bit fun  I yet disliked it.And now  the fifth movie has finally arrived and come to the cinemas anywhere. This is the movie that tells the background story of how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman... And it has never been that good. It is darker than ever  but the mind of humor is still there  and is noticed sometimes throughout the movie. You notice a few known faces - whose names are such like Gary Oldman  Morgan Freeman  Michael Caine  Katie Holmes  Cillian Murphy  Liam Neeson and Rutger Hauer. And of course  not to be forgotten  the star of this movie - Christian Bale. Honestly  I think Bale is perfectly characterized as Bruce Wayne alias Batman  probably also better than Michael Keaton  who I couldn't really like in the first two movies.. But in here  I really feel Bale is the right one as Batman... He gives a mix of feelings with fear  power  charisma and revenge. But I have to admit that Michael Caine really is great besides Batman as his butler  and he is also the first who gets to know Bruce's intentions of becoming Batman... and helps him in all ways  being like a sort of uncle for him. Caine is really an excellent actor and he gives a proof of him being one of the movie's greatest actors throughout the movie's history in this movie.It starts with Bruce as a little boy being attacked by a lot of bats and how he is getting nightmares of it. Some days later  interrupting a Opera show because of his fear of bats  Bruce sees his parents being murdered of a thief. He becomes powerless  making it his life purpose to revenge the one who killed his parents. But some incident 14 years later gets him to hide himself  taking him to the criminal way... and to a prison and finally to a mountain  where he meets a mystic man who teaches him to accept his fear and to fight. Back to Gotham City  Alfred becomes Bruce's truths worthy assistant and soon Bruce is able to characterize himself as Batman  Gotham City's rescuer from falling in decline. With help of a police (Oldman) and an employer of Wayne Tower (Freeman) who knew his father   Bruce tries to save the city and surprise the villains and give them what they deserve. But it becomes a hard fight against decline.A great movie that is thrilling  amazing and magnificent as well as masterful. Gotham City looks like a darker version of Chicago  Manhattan and Chinatown  and is greatly illustrated and dark toned. The stars are great and Holmes is fitting as Rachel  her serious charisma making it realistic. But even though it is great  the background story takes much time but it is yet great to know the background story of Batman  when you only experienced a few minutes of it in the first Batman movie with Keaton. This time it is different  modern  darker and more spectacular than ever  but I can't say if it is better than the two first movies - but one thing is true and it is that the background story is greatly made and that the stars have never been better. Actually  everything is great and I can't complain of anything bad in this movie  but I feel it is yet not enough to give this movie full grade... something is missing. It is the third movie this half year that is based on a comic book - first it was Sin City  then it was Fantastic Four and now this... Still Sin City is the best.\tI walked out of the theater thinking just two words...Tim...who? Stellar job...consistent with the spirit and letter of key features of the Batman legends critical to the character  and too easily brushed aside by the over-the-top renditions of the Burton/Schumacher franchise.Character  dialogue  story...outstanding in all respects (enough to draw some of the most talented and seasoned actors in the industry).Parting thoughts: keep Clooney  Schumacher and Burton as far away from this version as is conceivable...and no cameos by Adam West  please for the love of God! :)\tOkay  Katie Holmes looks like her eyes are going to slide off her face  but everything else in the movie was great. Who would have thought that Micheal Keaton would be supplanted as \""the\"" Batman? Christian Bale was fantastic. He has the build  the brooding brow  the spark of mischief Batman seriously needed. Keaton had it all but the build. Casting is everything in a movie  and obviously they went all out on this one. From Gary Oldman(on the side of the light  this time)and Micheal Caine (who works in any movie and usually makes them better than they were before) to Liam Neeson and even a small part by Ken Watanebe who shined in \""The Last Samurai\""  the cast truly made the movie. (Even Katie). And apparently Katie makes much better choices in work than her boyfriend. The plot was simple  yet elegant. We all know the story of Batman  where he came from  why he does what he does  and his backdrop  Gotham  and the crime within the city. We are given reasons for the crime  another good performance by Linus Roache (Riddick)as Bruce's father  and some great performances by the villains  especially Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow. The plot is simple but seamless. There are beginnings and endings which flow smoothly. The action is great  the cinematography is excellent  with Gothom stark and dark at the same time. Truly a great experience of a long movie which could have been longer.\tI try to avoid superhero movies because they are usually formulaic garbage  but not this one. The casting was superb  the story was superb  the sets were spectacular as were the special effects. Christian Bale as Batman was charismatic and realistic for a fictional character. Dare I say Oscar? The Movie is necessarily violent but not overdone. This is dark adult fun. It is also about overcoming fear and knowing the difference between revenge and justice. This is a smart movie with a man in a superhero costume. You know a movie is good when you leave the theater and you want to become the protagonist! Quick to the batcave!\tThis is the Batman I have been waiting for! Tim Burton's Batman (Batman  Batman Returns) movies were good Tim Burton movies  but not great Batman movies. Joel Schumucher's (Batman Forever  Batman and Robin) I'm convinced were made to mock the Dark knight and destroy his good name. But this new one is everything Batman should be and needs to be. And the villains are all played to perfection! Christopher Nolan is my favorite director and this (along with Memento) is his best work. If you see no other movie this year  see Batman Begins.Note: This is not a prequel to Tim Burton's Batman. This is a completely new Batman movie series.\tThe best batman movie with some minor flaws but overly enjoyable. One point that didn't make sense was the water vapourising machines - how come it only vaporised water in the pipes and not in the people? Thankfully I could suspend my disbelief on that point to enjoy there rest of the film. The Batmobile  for example  was a classic big of film hardware design and the acting was consistently enjoyable all the way through (altough drafting in Morgan Freeman and Micheal Cane was cheating).Well worth the money to watch - well worthy of a Batman continues  or what ever it's called and makes the Fantastic Four look like a ikea flat pack compared to this towering Gothic construction.Good plot  excellent build up and ending that doesn't fall totally flat (increasingly rare these days).\tI am a fantasy fan  first and foremost. While I've read my share of comic books  I'm certainly not a big fan. So you can believe me when I say it came as a surprise that Batman Begins went right up there into the top 3-5 list of the best movies I've seen in my life. Something even LoTR couldn't do  even if they too are near-perfect.Everything about the movie is top-notch. Acting is superb. Although I was sceptical of Katie \""the ever-teen\"" Holmes  she actually performe"
Bewitched (2005),"Movie is not as bad as reviews make it. If your expecting the TV show you'll be disappointed. But if not-it's an OK movie not fantastic but pretty good. The 1164 house does not appear  neither does Larry Tate. But 'Endora' and 'Gladys Kravitz' do as well as 'Aunt Clara' and 'Uncle Arthur'. Brief clips of the old TV show are at the beginning. And surprising appearance of the Googie coffee shop 'Pann's' at the beginning. Good and appropriate music including Frank Sinatra (or a sound alike) singing the TV series theme. Funny clip of the remade animated opening sequence. Movie was not as bad as I expected. Grade C+/B-\tI finally saw \Bewitched\"" and I was bewitched and charmed by the movie! The film is perfectly cast! Nicole Kidman  Will Farrell  Shirley MacLaine  and Michael Caine deliver marvelously and complete a wonderful  impressive  charismatic ensemble. Like the wonderful romantic comedies of bygone years  \""Bewitched\"" gives me a feeling that movies gave me when I was very young--I wanted it to be absolutely true! I enjoy thrillers and action movies  but I'm also a sucker for a good romance. This one fills me up with those sighs  lightness of being in the chest  and wishing the story would happen to me. I fell in love with the lead female character  and I secretly fantasize about being the man Isabel finds irresistible. It's not surprising that this is a wonderful romantic comedy because of the touch of Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron. I have enormous respect for the Ephron sisters. Nora  often in co-writing with her sister Delia  has written and directed some of the best romantic comedies in modern theatrical release. It shows that romantic stories are alive and loved as much as ever--wonderful news for the romantics of the world. I love Nora Ephron's style of directing comedy  with its romantic tension and tug-of-war obstacles between the romantic leads  with an ideal happy  feel-good endings. It may be predictable  but I'm also a sucker for happy endings. I sometimes feel cheated if things turn out badly for the lead characters. The Ephron touch that is experienced in \""Sleeping in Seattle \"" \""When Harry Met Sally \"" and \""You've Got Mail \"" to name three  is very apparent in \""Bewitched.\"" If anyone does not like this film  then they should go see a movie where they blow something up.This movie is not a fast-buck caricature of the original television series  and yet cleverly incorporates the original series as part of the story. It's a beautiful and respectful homage to Elizabeth Montgomery! Instead of ending or attempting to replace the legacy of the original Samantha  this film renews Montgomery's memory. Will Ferrell is a gifted comedic actor. He knows how far to push the envelope without losing the sympathy of the audience. He knows how to play a perfect jerk (as he did in \""Anchorman\"")  and yet he cleverly comes full circle and we can't help liking him when he reveals the vulnerable and remorseful side of his character. He is the obvious pivot upon which many of the laughs come in this film. Often I can imagine different actors playing a certain part  but I cannot think of anyone who would have done as good a job in the role of Isabel/Samantha than Nicole Kidman. She is absolutely perfect and nails the pixieish expressions and bewitching charms that Montgomery was so good at portraying  and yet Kidman makes them refreshingly her own. Kidman continues to amaze me and holds my admiration after many wonderful film roles. Isabel's vulnerability  naivit\u00e9  with a dash of witch's fire in her eyes is a lesson to any Acting 101 student. Cute also is Kidman's innocence in portraying Isabel's claim that she cannot act. That's like Fred Astaire's character in \""The Towering Inferno\"" claiming he can't dance.WARNING: SPOILER IN THIS PARAGRAPH! Shirely MacLaine is perfect as Iris playing Endora. I mean that in the sense that Shirley exudes the perfect amount of attitude that Endora requires and I think that it was a great touch to make Iris a witch. But  it makes sense to blend the old Endora with the new and come up with allowing MacLaine to make the role her own. I wonder if Shirley would think that perhaps Iris is sort of a way of making light of her more serious spiritual side. MacLaine does have that wonderful twinkle in her eye as she pretends to be mortal although Iris chooses not to fully come out of the broom closet. I do believe  however  that I would have had Iris causing even more trouble and show that even a witch with Iris's years in Hollywood cannot always resist the temptation of a little mischievous dabbling. With giant talents like MacLaine and Michael Caine as Nigel on the screen  and all those many film credits to their names  there was missed opportunity to have more comedy  romantic tension  and comedic plotting against one another  with a subplot to highlight these two talented actors.I also enjoyed the Paul Lynde / Uncle Arthur impression by Steve Carell who nearly stole the scene. I see where Carell will be the next Maxwell Smart in a 2006 film release and his performance here has suddenly perked my interest. The only other comment I would make  if constructive criticism is welcomed  is that I thought there were at least two scenes that should have been re-shot because I thought the audio quality was not what it should have been. That's certainly not anything that for which actors are at fault and perhaps that will not be a problem once the film gets digitally encoded on DVD. Hopefully  DVD production also allows opportunity to tweak the technical aspects of the film. One of the scenes in this regard I noticed in the theater is the first encounter and dialogue between Iris and Isabel. Overall this movie exceeded my expectations. Often  films based on TV shows  or remakes of past ideas are disappointing. \""Bewitched\"" is an \""A\"" movie  not a \""B\"" remake. If any movie does not have an earth-shaking philosophical message  challenges the intellect  is action packed drama  or tells an amazing true story  then it must in other ways be outstandingly entertaining. When I walk out of a theater and say I'd like to see it again  which for me does not happen often no matter how much I enjoyed it  then I know the film struck my imagination in a very positive way. \""Bewitched\"" enchants.\tScore out of 5 stars:Zero stars.The TV show wasn't that classy  but it was a lot better then this drivel. At least it was not as boring and as seat numbing as this mess of a film. In this film  there is not any connection between the characters. In fact  there does not seem to be anything that made the TV show so wonderful; actual jokes. I saw this film during this afternoon and there were many times when I felt like walking out but did not because I thought the film would improve. How wrong was I. I did try to find some good in it  but I'm sorry I just could not recommend this to anyone  even when available on DVD.\t\""A film by Nora Ephron.\"" Words to chill the blood of any macho American male. When I saw these words appear on the screen all I could think of was how this woman was responsible for about 17 Meg Ryan/Tom Hanks romantic comedies (I think Tom must've been unavailable for When Harry Met Sally)  including You've Got Mail  Sleepless in Seattle  and A Sleepless Harry Met Sally in Seattle After Getting His Mail. In fact  I think Meg Ryan has appeared in so much sap that she actually has a syrup named after her. If she doesn't  then I say we start up the petition right now! But you know what? This movie ended up entertaining me way more than I should be willing to admit. It does get pretty silly and goofy  and at times the jokes start to gag on their own cuteness. After all  we're expected to laugh at the fact that Nicole Kidman gets absolutely excited over sprinklers and microwave popcorn because hey  she's a witch  and to a witch this kind of stuff is cool! And I suppose we're expected to howl in laughter every time an actress auditions for the role of Samantha by crinkling her nose really badly. The stone cold silence that I introduced to these scenes probably wasn't what Ms. Ephron was shooting for. But every now and then the goofiness is charming enough to work - that is if you're willing to laugh at such things as Will Ferrell singing a cheesy song he wrote for Kidman  complete with him mouthing the guitar solo.I know Hollywood is on a massive remake trend right now  but this is just clever enough to make it feel slightly different  slightly original. But it's Kidman and Ferrell  rather than the screenplay  that really raise the watchability factor. Kidman redeems herself from the horrid The Stepford Wives  showing that she can handle comedy  and Will Ferrell is  well  Will Ferrell. That basically means that he can be both annoying and funny at the same time  and he's at his best when it looks like he's being allowed to ad-lib  and when he's really putting huge doses of arrogance into his character  demanding  \""Make me 20 cappuccinos and bring me the best one.\"" It's nothing really worth the oxygen to try to convince you that it's a definite must-see at the theater  nor did it excite me enough to reel off more than four paragraphs for this review  but it's a light  silly little comedy that generated quite a few chuckles and a handful of laugh-out-loud moments. I'd say trust your instinct on this one. If you're dying to see it then catch a matin\u00e9e  if you're on the fence then save it for a rental  and if you have no desire to see it then just skip it. I don't care. I ain't making any money off it.\tThis movie was not trying to be the end all of films  so I don't recommend it for hardcore Bewitched fans who desire an entire revival. However  it was a cute movie. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It was like they did not try too hard to make it any one particular thing. It was about 95 minutes of some humor  some drama  and some love  combining for the perfect potion of success. Don't have high expectations  because this is definitely not an Oscar hit  but the movie fulfilled what it set out to do: make a romantic comedy with a touch of magic. If you are looking for a simple comedy with a little bit of love  go see this movie. I definitely recommend it.\tThere would not be much of a debate about whether it is a wise proposition to attempt to create a respectable movie from a successful television series. Notwithstanding a handful of flukes (Charlie's Angels  M*A*S*H  Peewee's Playhouse (the first one)  The Fugitive (the first one)  Mission Impossible  and Batman (the first and last one)  most attempts have fallen by the wayside as so much fluff or really bad stuff. There is something about bringing the small screen to the big that stymies even the most talented of directors/writers. Such is the case with Bewitched. Nora Ephron has been responsible for a couple of the most endearing movies of the past ten years. Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail are hands down two of the most memorable movies of their kind to come along in many years. In both films  Ephron combined heart  soul  and a deep sense of character to create ast0nishingly insightful and watch- able films. In her present endeavor  however  she somehow abandons the previous successful formula and fails miserably. Sometimes I just can't imagine how movies with such a wealth \u0096 a literal goldmine \u0096 of talent can fail. But this one does and does so grandly.The twist is cute. A production within a production was probably a good idea to start with. We follow the has-been character of Jack Wyatt (Will Farrell) as he makes an attempt to resuscitate his bombed out movie career by recreating the character of Darrin in the famous sit-com of the 60's/70's. Ironically  the funniest line in the movie is when Jack laments the fact that he is playing Darren  a character that they replaced mid series  and NO ONE NOTICED. This is unfortunately a bit of unintended foreshadowing of things to come. The usually infectious Ferrell is flat as a pancake in his bid to give this pompous ass some life. Along the same lines  Nicole Kidman really stinks up the place as Samantha. Playing the \""nobody\"" the Jack insists be cast opposite his \""star \"" Kidman is all wrong. The only thing she does right is the nose twitch  and she does do it well  but she uses a Marilyn Monroe whispish accent that is nothing short of annoying and for some god forsaken reason abandons all the depth of character she ordinarily exhibits for a white-washed and infantile characterization that is dreadfully shallow. Whew! Needless to say  we don't care about the characters in the least. A great part of the charm of the original series was the \""star crossed lovers\"" aspect and the societal allegory involving the union of \""different\"" types of people. None of that is even touched on here  and if it were we wouldn't care anyway. The most disturbing thing of all is that Ephron's style was perfect for this movie. There is so much potential here it literally makes you sick. Not even the incredible talents of Shirley Mac Laine and the indomitable Michael Caine can salvage this erstwhile piece of claptrap.The bottom line is  avoid this flick. It might me a good one to find while flipping through the channels after a few Bud Lights at the end of a long weekend  but even then I doubt it would keep ones attention for long. It is so sad to waste all the talent associated with Bewitched. Poor  poor Elizabeth Montgomery  wherever she is  having to have her legacy blemished in such a foul way; shame on them all. And you all thought I liked everything!\tBEWITCHED gets off to a very bad start. The plot is known in advance: a real witch  almost accidentally  gets hired to star in a new TV series based on the old TV series \""Bewitched.\"" What little drama the plot offers is how she hides and then reveals her magical powers. But the film begins with Nicole Kidman's Isabel Bigelow revealing her little secret to the audience almost immediately; she rents a house and uses her magic spells to make herself at home. Even though we know in advance that Isabel is a witch  from a dramatic and comic point of view  that little secret should be revealed little by little. Just like THE TRUMAN SHOW  this film has but one real plot twist and the filmmakers blow it before the theme music has stopped echoing on the soundtrack. The idea to make a big screen version of \""Bewitched\"" had been bouncing around Hollywood for over a decade and obviously it passed through too many hands -- all of whom must have added their own little touches. The result is a project that certainly isn't short on inspiration  but is woefully short on purpose. What surely began as a straightforward remake of the series (witch marries mortal and tries to live the normal life of a suburban housewife)  somehow took a surreal twist into a story about remaking the TV show. Not an altogether bad idea; but having taken the leap of faith of moving the material from sitcom to Hollywood satire  the filmmakers don't run with the idea. If real witchcraft became a part of a real TV show  how would it be used? To cast a spell so that everyone in the country would watch? Or not watch? To make people laugh at every joke  no matter how unfunny the material? To take control of the network? But what does Isabel do? She makes a trained dog come to her during a scene so she can steal a punchline. Oh wow  all the power in the world and she uses it to upstage her fellow actors. Other than bits of passing trivia  little of the original TV series remains a part of the movie  especially the central concept. On TV  Elizabeth Montgomery's Samantha vows to renounce witchcraft in order to conform to Darrin's work ethic; it is  in essence  the story of royalty abdicating for the love of a commoner. And yet  it is also the story of a mixed marriage: Dick York's Darrin marries into a family with a different ethnic background and becomes the target of their bigotry. The subtexts of class distinction and racial confrontation had resonance in the turbulent 1960's. The strength of the Stephen's marriage was measured by Samantha's commitment to sacrifice and Darrin's defiant defense of his class  culture and mortality. Both had something to fight for and to protect. In the movie  instead of being kept apart by \""religious\"" differences and interfering family members  the plot resorts to the usual contrived romantic comedy misunderstandings. Worse  Kidman and her would-be Darrin (Will Ferrell) have no chemistry; she's doing faux Marilyn Monroe and he's mugging for the camera like Jerry Lewis. And it is hard to respect any movie that teams up Shirley MacLaine and Michael Caine and reduces their roles to barely memorable cameos. The unfulfilled promise of having MacLaine step into Agnes Moorehead's iconic role as Endora  the ultimate in meddling mother-in-laws  is particularly galling. And while Steve Carell and Carole Shelley do fine homages to Paul Lynde's Uncle Arthur and Marion Lorne's Aunt Clara  their appearances as fictional characters in the film's \""real\"" world makes no sense. The film doesn't even have the convoluted logic of a supernatural sitcom. I suppose the film should be given credit for not going overboard on the special effects  but so little is done with the whole idea of witchcraft that it hardly plays any role in the actual story. Given a project where flamboyant special effects actually make sense for a change  the filmmakers inexplicably balk  settling for parlor tricks rather than eye-popping wizardry. And a film about magic offers precious little -- in its special effects  its screenplay  its direction or its performances. Instead of being bewitched it seems de-witched.\tBewitched starring Will Ferrel and Nicole Kidman is about an actor Jack Wyatt (Will Ferrell) who wants to create a new version of the movie Bewitched. Having problems finding a good witch  Jack Wyatt comes across Isabel Bigelow (Nicole Kidman)  and wants her to play as Samantha in the new movie. Not to Jack Wyatt's knowledge  Isabel Bigelow really was a witch.Bewitched was amazing thanks to Will Ferell. Will Ferell can make any line funny  and he proves it in this film. Some parts of the movie is very dull though. When Isabel Bigelow's father Nigel Bigelow (Michael Caine) appears  it becomes very dull and worthless.I would rate this movie 7 out of 10 because it was very funny  though some part were extremely dull.\tNora Ephron has written some very funny romantic comedies in her time (When Harry met Sally/Sleepless In Seattle/You've Got Mail)  but one has to wonder why she chose to put her magical spin on a rehash of the old TV show \""Betwitched\"". She wisely decides to update the story  by making a movie about a remake of the old TV show  turning some of the laughs on Hollywood stereotypes  BUT... it still doesn't quite work.I will say that Nicole Kidman deserves major kudos for coming off cute and adorable amidst this mishmesh of homage to the old show and quips at modern Hollywood. Her performance is stellar considering what she is given to work with and she balances \""over the top\"" Will Ferrell's (less is more Will. Less is more!) pound for pound with her turn as Ephron's new Meg Ryan. Also noteworthy is Michael Caine strutting through it all  as her warlock father and the delightful Shirley McClain who as a grand Hollywood madam  is playing... well... a grand Hollywood madam who is making her comeback playing Endora on the new Bewitched TV show. Michael Baldalucci also gives a funny cameo as a frustrated animal/props guy who wonders why none of his sure-fire stuff doesn't work (The magic interferes with it).Ferrels' improvisational dialogue is funny at times and grating at others. He has always been hit or miss in my book since his early SNL days  and frankly  someone needs to stop telling him that everything out of his mouth is hysterical... It's not. As a romantic lead  uh... No. Folks  you get Dick Sargent Darren in this and not Dick York.One wonders what kind of film this would have been if Jim Carrey had followed through with the original deal. We certainly would have had some broader physical and sight-gag comedy. Something that I was hoping for in this and in my opinion  it wasn't delivered. As Darren  I feel he would have been a better romantic interest and a funnier Darren. Dick York  not Dick Sargent.Lastly  I had a huge problem with dropping in characters from the original TV show. OK  if Nicole Kidman's character just happens to have an aunt who is also named Clara  fine. I'll buy that. She's also a bungling witch. Fine  I'm still with you. Throwing in Uncle Arthur at the end was a big MISTAKE. Showing clips of the delightful Paul Lynd playing the real Uncle Arthur was a BIGGER MISTAKE. Two coincidences is TOO MUCH. If you were going to do that  then at least throw in a side story that this new witch is the reason the old show was written. All of the characters were based on her family back in the fifties. But you did not do that. You changed our new witches name as well as her father's  then decided to throw in real characters named for the old show's characters. CONFUSING! Steve Carrel is usually very funny. I loved him on the ill fated Dana Carvey show  I love him on the Daily show  But he does a terrible impression of Uncle Arthur  ugh. and that phony nose. Ugh!\tThis is one awful movie. The script is boring lacking any humor  must have been editing it a hurry. If this is the best they could come up with I would hate to see the deleted scenes. Nicole is cute but almost embarrassing with Will Farrell. His character is obnoxious as is the actor as well. Would not bother even on DVD. Could have done better with a stronger co-star  no need for an idiot to play this part. try Michael Caine is good in his role as Samantha's father in fact given his lines does an honorable job. Again  don't waste the popcorn on this one  if you are in a multiplex get up and watch something else  anything is better than this.\tSamatha certainly has a nose problem and it ain't her twitch  this movie stinks! When will Hollywood stop tampering and \""improving\"" upon beloved TV shows? Give us what we want  not some confusing premise about a movie redoing a classic TV show with a new TV show...in other words  huh? Or better yet  when will we the public  demand to stop being treated like chumps by keeping our hard earned money in our wallets? After Nicole Kidman appeared in the awful \""Stepford Wives\"" (again another 'take' on a great novel)  I didn't think she could sink any lower but she has. Greed wins out again! Now that Hollywood has bulldozed through the TV graveyards of the 1960's and 1970's with inane remakes it's on to the 1980's. I can't wait to see \""The Facts of Life\"" on the big screen with a dope smoking Tootie!\tIt is never a good thing to sit in a theater watching a comedy and hearing no noise -- not laughing  not giggles  not even smiles. I sat and watched this film with about 100 other people in dead silence. The air was still and that could describe the movie -- just still and flat.I can't say the people involved didn't try  you can tell they did. It just failed. You can see Nicole Kidman working as hard as she can to breathe some life into the film -- alas  to no avail.I usually can find something good to say about most movies  in this case I really can't. I guess that Kristen Chenoweth and Shirley MacLaine were entertaining  but in the end  wasted in parts that go nowhere.\tWill Ferrel is a tool. Yes  Will. Not Jack Wyatt. Will Ferrel. Much like Adam Sandler or Rob Schneider  Will stars in another self-serving vehicle where he gets to spazz out and act like an obnoxious A-hole and then get paid a couple million dollars for it.A handful of one-dimensional characters stuck in a four-dimensional film that drags on for two hours makes for a lot of time that you wished you could get back. Ferrel and Kidman's romantic involvement felt tacked on like a huge \""Kick Me\"" sign on the back of this movie... and boy  do you ever feel like kicking the living &^%$ out of it. The only thing that felt more forced that the romance was Ferrel trying to make you laugh and instead making you wonder \""what time is it?\""2 stars because at least Nicole didn't act like a tool.\tI honestly want to cry. I have never seen I film I have sat through as unwillingly. I was prepared for it to be at least semi decent. I ended up bored and really  desperately wanting to leave. The scrooge in me made me remember the money I'd paid to get in  though looking back I'd rather that I'd wasted \u00a34.80 than 2 hours of my life. It was the first time I've ever applauded the credits appearing. There was one bit that was funny  with Will Ferrell at the dinner table  but that may just have been good in contrast with the rest of the film.I really really want to forget everything about this film.However there were people behind me laughing their heads off  so who knows  you may like it.\tAaaahhh...it was sort of a waste of time. I really loved the show  and that show was made before I was born! So imagine the disappointment.Well  I'm a fan  so I really wanted like a story about Samantha and Darrin  but it wasn't quite what I thought. Then the plot was too simple  I thought it was dumbed down for children  maybe the children would feel insulted. Shirley Maclaine's and Michael Caine's talents were not put to good use  their characters were haphazardly developed  if at all. Will Ferrel was good  kinda amazed he held his own with Nicole Kidman. Kidman was cute  too cute  like a child  but maybe they meant that.I'll give them one thing: the movie was charming. It's a feel good movie. BUt the ending was a bit twisted  won't spoil it for you folks  but Bewitched fans  I'm sure you'll find the ending a bit twisted...Good enough to be marketable  but ultimately a waste of time. I'd rather watch the original show  but it's not so bad that you'd want to see Jeannie...\tWe've seen it all before - a once-brilliant actor is trying to re-boost his career using a previously unheard of woman whom he falls in love with. Only this time the woman just happens to be a witch - exactly what she has been cast as. What are the odds? Kidman whispers her way through what seems like four hours of corny jokes and tacky romantic lines  whilst Ferrel is just himself - a complete moron. The plot is more obvious that a kid's cartoon  and no amount of magical spells could disguise the lack of skill that has been put into making this film. Before I saw the film  I thought it might have potential. Bewitched was a good show  and it might have been good to give it a makeover. It looks like they've totally messed that up  though  as the new  unoriginal  tacky \""rom-com\"" (if it could ever be called a comedy)'s only connections with the original are its name and the characters that seem to have been tangled up with each.\tNot the Bewitched I remember  or were they trying to make us forget the original. Seriously  I have seen good movie remakes of old TV shows  but this was NOT one of them. This movie could have been a tribute to Elizabeth Montgomery  Dick York  Agnes Moorehead  Dick Sargeant  and the rest of the old cast and guest stars both living and not. Instead  we got a movie that was relying on the title and a couple of big name stars alone to sell tickets. I felt I was robbed of what could have been a good move. Not a great movie  just a good movie  but I never expected it to be as bad as this movie is. Kidman  Caine  McClaine were all good choices  but the script was bad. Ferrell did nothing for me.\tWith less than stellar reviews  I did not expect much. Instead I found the movie quite enjoyable. Nicole Kidman was wonderful as always and Will Ferrell at least suitable. The original Darrin was  although often nervous  a mellow character compared to Will  but this role needed him to be several different personalities and he delivered admirably.As a huge fan of the original Bewitched show  I would have been satisfied with a remake following the original plot lines. Again  I was pleasantly surprised by the storyline with its interesting twists and creative introduction of all the familiar characters. Not everything worked perfectly  but it was certainly a good effort.Finally  Nicole Kidman was sensational. When I first heard she was going to be Samantha (or in this case  Isabel)  it was immediately obvious that she would be perfect  and she was. She has been remarkable this year. The Stepford Wives was not a brilliant remake  but without Nicole  it would have been unimaginably horrible.Without comparing Nicole to other actresses  current or past  I can easily say that she is on top of her game and among my favorites all time. I don't know if I would have liked this movie without Nicole  but I'm glad I didn't have to try.\tAm I missing something here.For after reading some of the reviews from IMDb and the media and after having now watched the film  well I thought that I mustn't be switched on. All in all I enjoyed this film and will probably buy it on DVD. This movie was never going to live up to the high expectations by hardened fans of the original 1960's hysterical comedy. Indeed there really aren't all that many belly laughs. This film  with it's clever script  is every nice little romantic comedy. The performances were very good and how any one can call Nicole Kidman a poor actress is beyond me - She is just great. I don't believe in getting too analytical about these sorts of movies and I urge everyone too watch it and enjoy!! 7 out of 10\tI heard they were making a remake of the movie \""Bewitched\"". I loved that show so I decided to see the movie with a bunch of friends. I was so wrong to ever purchase that movie ticket. First of all  remakes do suck but I thought I would give it a try. Here is 5 reasons the movie was bad.1.To LONG!!!!!!!!!! 2.The acting.....terrible.... 3.THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SERIES!!!!!!!! 4.It was like the same thing repeating over and over again. 5.Did I say to long??I was very disappointed in this movie. Even a few of my friends walked out but of course I thought the movie would get better but it din't. And all the funny parts were in the preview. I give this movie 1/10. DO NOT SEE IT!"""
Broken Flowers (2005),"This movie was excellent. I loved Jeffrey Wright and Heather Alicia Simms. My daughter plays the couples youngest daughter. I laughed through out the film. Sharon Stone was marvelous as she is in all her movies. Bill Murray a gem  has out done himself again. I only wish they come out with a second part. This movie had me wanting more and thats a good thing. I loved the part when he met up with Sharon Stone and her funny daughter  the rough bicycle women who's brothers gave Bill a roughen up and left him in the middle of no where. I will watch this movie again  and of course buy the DVD. I actually got to meet this marvelous man they call Bill Murray he is a wonderful man.\tA fine acting job by the actors/actresses were ruined by the s-l-o-w pace of the movie. It took forever for things to happen. At many points in the movie you are just watching Bill Murray gaze off into space for what seems like eternity. No dialogue  no movement. Just nothing. I know this happens in real life  but in 105 minute movie; 20-30 minutes shouldn't be spent on absolutely nothing. Bill Murray  playing his role brilliantly  adds to this slow paced feeling. He speaks very little  letting his expressions do his talking and when he does talk he shows no affect. The one person who added a little life to the movie was Jeffrey Wright  who turned in a credible role as the friend/neighbor. The bottom line is don't see the movie if you are tired. The pacing may put you to right to sleep.\tObviously the director was more interested in having Murray show how empty his life was at 50. Unfortunately  without some kind of back story  I found it really hard to believe he had Sharon Stone  Jessica Lange  and Tilda Swinton hot for him in a 5-6 month period when he was 30. I expected to see some spark of something that made him attractive to these fabulous women (he wasn't rich at 30)  but I didn't see it. What exactly did Delpy and Lolita girl (and even the flower girl at the cemetery) see in him at 50? I first thought maybe the references to Don Juan and Don Johnson were supposed to gentle put downs against a guy that obviously did not fit the bill. But every character did think Murray was quite the stud with a big rep. Maybe that's the look for 2005: a balding  graying slug in a polyester sweat suit.\tI guess it's more fun making some movies than watching them. You get to go on location  eat and drink at the producer's expense  have a great time. I don't know if Bill Murray liked just sitting and staring  but he's paid to do it.The viewers  on the other hand  didn't get the money  travel  eat  drink and fun. In fact  we had to pay  which is painful. So we would like something back for our nickle (hah!). Paying to watch these egotists dish out crap with no intention of entertaining  educating  elucidating or doing anything for the viewers is a joke  on us  the viewers. All this thing did was bore us.Well  they had their fun at our expense. Will there be a consequence? Doesn't seem like it. They'll just go ahead and make another \art film\"" and the reviewers will hype it to death  and we'll go see it and complain again. Why? Because we're stupid? No  because we have more faith in the goodness of human nature than these con artists have.\tEccentric and episodic filmmaker Jim Jarmusch (\""Dead Man \"" \""Mystery Train \"" \""Down By Law\"") teams up with the master of the deadpan  Bill Murray (\""The Life Aquatic\"")  for one of the most thoughtful and meaningful movies of the year. As his current girlfriend  Sherry (Julia Delpy  \""Before Sunset\"") is leaving him  confirmed bachelor  Don Johnston (Murray)  receives a pink letter informing him that he has a son approaching 20 years of age. Shocked by this revelation  he tells wacky Ethiopian neighbor  Winston (Jeffrey Wright  \""Ali \"" \""The Manchurian Candidate\"")  who plans an entire travel itinerary for Johnston to seek out past lovers and try find his son. Winston  who loves detective novels  goes about solving the mystery like a budget Sherlock Homes  examining and re-examining the pink envelope and its contents for any clue whatsoever. Johnston wants no part of this  however  believing the entire thing is a joke. Still  he takes the trip  not only discovering what several past girlfriends (Sharon Stone  Francis Conroy  Jesseca Lange and Tilda Swinton) are doing now  but just how shallow and manliness's his Don Juan lifestyle has been. The film is sort of like \""Sideways\"" for the manically-depressed  and Jarmusch's quirky style and long pauses may take some getting used to  but it's well worth the time. There are also some classic comedy moments  such as when Stone's teenage nymphet of a daughter (appropriately named \""Lolita\"") puts the moves on him; and when he is forced to have a really uptight dinner with real estate agent Conroy and her uptight husband (Christopher McDonald  \""Happy Gilmore\""). Murray doesn't run the gamut of emotions he did in his Oscar-nominated turn in \""Lost In Translation \"" but he can communicate a feeling with a smirk or frown better than most actors today can with five pages of dialogue. It's an excellent performance. On the other side of the acting coin is Wright  who soars with enthusiasm for Johnston's journey  planning everything down to the letter. It's fun and he balances Murray perfectly. despite the fine acting all around  one of my favorite aspects of the film was the terrific original African jazz soundtrack by Mulate Astatke  which was as much a part of the motion picture as the dialogue.\tWent into D.C. on Saturday to see Broken Flowers at the Landmark Theatre there. It was such an excellent movie. Bill Murray played his role of Don Johnston flawlessly. Sharon Stone was pretty damn good for the short time she was in the film. And they both actually played off of each other pretty well.The movie was totally a Jim Jarmusch movie though. I think a lot of people were worried that he was going \""mainstream\"" with this movie. But all worries are put to rest after seeing the movie  it is a Jarmusch film all the way. Everything about it screams Jim Jarmusch; the story  characters  humor  cinematography  editing  music  and pacing are all Jarmusch. I love it.I am sure some people who see it  might find the pacing a bit slow. As my girlfriend put it  \""It's paced like a french film.\"" But that is high praise coming from her. All of Jarmusch's films are paced a bit slow though. They aren't about the big events in life that most movies center around. They are usually about the small things  that most of us don't even bother thinking about. I think that gives his movies a bit more realism than most movies though. And that is part of these reason I love his films.Spoilers Below - This movie is also much more about the journey than it is about the destination. I love how the ending is left very open to interpretation. The one kid he met could be his son  but probably not. Or his son could still be out there somewhere  anywhere. He could be any kid that Don sees on the street. Or he may not have a son at all  the letter could be a Hoax  done by a couple different people.The evidence is put forth for a couple theories  but a definite answer is never given. We never know for sure. But it also doesn't matter  the movie isn't about who or where his son is. It is about him looking back at his life  and seeing what was  what could have been  and what is. Such an awesome movie.\tI love Jarmusch's style - there are very few directors today who approach film-making in such a unique way (maybe Todd Solondz). This movie was incredible. I like Murray and he excels in his role as a retired computer businessman? who is well-retired and believes he has a son from a lover 20 years earlier. If you have a Short-Attention-Span than this movie and Jarmusch are not for you. The pacing fits the character development and the silence-as-script approach that is pure Jarmusch. As he visits each of his lovers in turn to surreptitiously detect his sons' mother (and the writer of the letter that starts his quest)  he encounters women who are the same as he remembers and at the same time very different. His journey raises more questions about all concerned than it answers and he does not know which way to turn  so he turns in all directions. I highly recommend this and hope it gets a wider distribution.\tFilms this restrained can only be made by an experienced filmmaker  a guy who knows what he wants to say and how to say it and doesn't have to worry about impressing everyone with witty banter or fancy camera tricks. Broken Flowers is so restrained  I'm sure it will elicit some of the same responses Bill Murray's last two films (The Life Aquatic  Lost in Translation) received  mainly \u0097 what's the big fuss about? The big fuss is that like Jim Jarmusch  Murray's an experienced craftsman  who understands that true talent lies in how much you give to your supporting actors  not in how much spotlight you take. Movie acting is all in the eyes and subtle body language  not in bombast. but mostly it's in being able to listen to your fellow actors. It's counterintuitive  that a visual medium relies so much on quiet  but it's what separates the great performances from the over-hyped. Let's hope that a subtle movie like this one avoids massive media attention  as that would be missing its point. And what  many may ask  is the point of Broken Flowers. At the screening I attended many were confused  others disappointed by the ending. Indeed  if there is one niggling detail that separates this film from perfection  it is the ending. Of course  Indian rugmakers intentionally weave mistakes into their wares  because they believe only God is perfect  my point being that the theme of this film is that in a quest for meaning  sometimes we learn there is no answer or that the answer is complex. In this case  Jarmusch seems to be saying that meaning is already present  but you might only glean it if you are prepared. Murray's character  Don Johnston (with a \""T\"")  only went on the road trip at his neighbour's urging  and clearly felt the whole thing was nonsense. His attitude may have caused him to miss the mystery  but discover new truths. Similarly  the audience may become too fixated with solving the mystery of who the mother of his son is and miss the other truths  namely that Johnston already has a family with his next-door neighbours  and he already has a relationship as good as he would have had with any of his past flames. The pink typewritten letter  the long-lost son  they are not the point of his life. As Johnston himself says  \""The past is gone  the future's not here yet. All there is is now.\""\tWithin the hierarchy of bad movies is your standard mundane crap  then below that is your steaming crap which is overshadowed only by the category of vile steaming crap. The only thing that saved \""Broken Flowers\"" from exceeding vile steaming crap was about 5 seconds of totally gratuitous nudity.It was one of those films where I seriously considered checking with the people in line to buy tickets so I could talk someone out of seeing this.This is officially the film that inaugurates Bill Murry into the Woody Allen genre of overstaying ones welcome. Had the film been as bad as \""Lost In Translation\"" it would have at least been an interesting failure  but here it seems Murry revisits the level of vile steamingness of \""The Razor's Edge\"" and succeeds in surpassing it.Jarmusch is an extremely boring director. If the film  which felt like it was two hours  but was only a little over an hour and a half  was edited down to remove all of the car driving scenes  the Murry staring into the camera scenes  the plane and airport scenes  it's actual narrative content would not have amounted to much more than 15 minutes.Bill  I think it's time you took up golf full time. . .\tThere has been a lot of talk that \""Broken Flowers\"" is Jim Jarmusch's most commercially accessible film to date. One can almost hear Jarmusch muttering something reactionary like \""commercial? That's just a label.\"" It's a label that some Jarmusch fans might associate with \""selling out\"". But selling out does not apply to Jim Jarmusch. He still has complete control of his work and is still the only American filmmaker who owns his own negatives. If \""Broken Flowers\"" does break into the mainstream  it is nothing overly deliberate. Jarmusch makes familiar films that seem intimate in their tone. He toys with old themes while still leaving his films open to interpretation. \""Broken Flowers\"" is a travelogue and like most Jarmusch films  the story is more concerned with the journey but not so much about the destination. Bill Murray plays Don Johnston  a man who we know little about. We know he's single and we know he's had some flame's in the past. The last one just walked out on him. When Don receives an anonymous letter from one of these old flames  he learns that he has a twenty year old son who might be looking for him.\"" Don thinks this is a joke but takes the advice from a friend to unfold the mystery by tracking down his past flings. He flies somewhere to a generic American place  rents a car and begins his investigation. Each ex has an individual personality but most of them share something similar. They are content and have moved on from the past. One of the ex's we meet works in real estate and decides it would be a good idea for her to get into the water business because \""one day in the near future it will be more valuable then oil.\"" The atmosphere is awkward and rather then care whether this woman is responsible for the anonymous letter  we just feel like getting out of there. The film's journey is absurd in many ways because we are never sure what the real point is. What is Don going to do if he does find his son? This where Bill Murray's credit as an actor shines through. We see from his small facial gestures that he is empty  and sad. There is a sense of longing as if life took a wrong turn somewhere and it is only now that he is realizing it. The ending of \""Broken Flowers\"" is what really makes the film special. Don't expect too much or too little. Just see it. Its inspiring  hopeful and better then any other movie this year. The film also has a great soundtrack by Ethiopian musician  Mulatu Astatke. And we see in the credits that Jarmusch dedicated the film to French filmmaker Jean Eustache. Jean Eustache made a phenomenal film in the 1960's titled  \""The Mother and The Whore\"". He had an influence on John Cassavetes and likewise both had an influence on Jim Jarmusch.\tThis is a fine movie with some wonderful moments within it. However  it doesn't have enough of those wonderful moments to fully flesh it out. It's a good thing they had those moments though  because they saved the movie for me.Bill Murray is indeed wonderful and a true pleasure to watch. The few moments that allowed him to go deep within this character were amazing. He deserved more of those moments.It's great to see Jessica Lange in true form. She plays her part wonderfully  as does the always likable Christopher MacDonald.All in all  the movie is a nice attempt at being a brilliant movie. But it's \""moments\"" are too far between. The ending which should have been a moment  was a miss for me. It's worth seeing though.\tI can't say I'm a Jim Jarmish fan. However  this collaboration with Bill Murray brought the best out of both of them. Bill is just amazing anyway. His acting draws the viewer in to his world. The saying \"" less is more\"" Murray epitomizes. Jarmish plays with the same idea and allows silence to act in this film. The mood the stark film quality and story give all the actors room to breath. Every scene is an evolution into unfolding feeling. Basically  this film seemed written for Murray's effortlessness acting style. Yet Murray's character is played at first with almost totally non-vulnerability\u0085 you want him to open up. But all the time you see glimmers of him doing just that and then you even appreciate his stuck-ness. All the other actors are wonderful as well. I have seen Sharon Stone's acting as someone trying to hard  but people  she was just crazy and alive in her role in this film. She changed my mind. Jessica Lange's performance is just perfect. What a woman. All in all I must give this film 2 thumbs up and my big toes are saluting it as well. Funny  thoughtful and very entertaining. Bravo.\tThe film opens with Don John...ston (get it?) watching what appears to be a version of Don Juan (sorry  I don't know which one...) as his sad girlfriend breaks it off. Adrift in anomie  this aging Don Juan watches his black and white counterpart.All the Jarmusch deadpan meets the Murray deadpan. A delight to watch.A letter launches Murray on a series of encounters that are reminiscent of the tape loop of his earlier movie. He is stuck in his narcissism. Although superficially the encounters with exes are different from one another  they all play the same theme of sadness  dissatisfaction  drift. Like the pink flowers that he brings each woman  the encounters are variations composed of the same motifs. Each offers successively less entre to this face from the past  throwing him back more and more on himself.At the very moment he is convinced the letter is a hoax  he also comes to believe in the son. The possibility leads to his rebirth. For the first time he becomes emotionally open  achieving a contact that has eluded him through the transcendent narcissism of parenthood  even if only imagined.Film maker and actor both just get better and better. A very sweet movie.\t\""Broken Flowers \"" I guess  is supposed to be this long  contemplative film about a man's journey into his past to discover how his life and history of loves has added up. Initially  the film is structured as a mystery - as Bill Murray's character tries to find the old girlfriend who bore his son  but it's more about the journey than the destination.But  to me  this movie was one of the most boring things I've ever sat through. There are an endless number of minutes-long takes of Bill Murray driving a car by himself. There are several scenes of him sitting alone in his living room  listening to the stereo and thinking. A couple of these scenes  where the silences could be meaningful and carry depth  would be fine in a film like this  if the film carried more weight or gave Murray's character more of a background than \""a bemused  aging Don Juan.\"" Instead  once the movie ends  I felt like it contained several good scenes where Murray interacted with the old girlfriends and about 30 minutes of dead air. Why  why  WHY were there four editing cuts done as Murray drove a Taurus down a country road? Wouldn't one shot establish the plot point as much as is necessary? I get it. He's driving.Oh  and I figured out that Murray's character was an aging Don Juan within the first five minutes  when he's watching the movie about Don Juan. I didn't need to have Julie Delpy call him \""Don Juan \"" then have Jeffrey Wright call him \""Don Juan \"" then have everyone comment on how his name is Don Johnston. I get the point. Don't hammer it into the ground.This is not a good movie. If it gets across-the-board good reviews  I'll be baffled. It's pretentious  meaningless and doesn't go very far. It doesn't function as a mystery. It doesn't function successfully as an illustration of a character. Good actors  like Jessica Lange  Frances Conroy and Sharon Stone  are given little to do in episodic scenes.All in all  the emperor's not wearing any clothes.\tI was lucky enough to get a sneak preview through the Traverse City Film Festival last night. Overall  I thoroughly enjoyed it. I particularly appreciated that each new family that Don met was neurotic and different in its own way  but the filmmaker didn't feel the need to explain everything--just let the audience absorb it and come to their own conclusions. My favorite interaction was between Don and his neighbor's wife--\""Do you know you're the perfect woman?\"" made me smile from ear to ear.The only thing I felt the movie was lacking was in the ending. I understand what the director was going for  but the unresolved conflict left a bad taste in my mouth.I'd highly recommend.\tI'm more of fan of Jim Jarmusch than Bill Murray  but I think his performance in Broken Flowers is the highlight of the movie. His ubiquitous deadpan never carried so much weight as in this role as the aging Don Juan character  Don Johnston. A strong rebuff to those that thought Lost in Translation was his one-of-a-kind-role-of-a-lifetime etc. Broken Flowers is a Jim Jarmusch film that belongs with the best of his work (Down By Law  Mystery Train  Dead Man  Ghost Dog) - films that entertain and provoke thought in equal measure  that keep the sense of auteur vision without sacrificing accessibility. I was disappointed by Coffee and Cigarettes  but this film restored my faith in Mr. Jarmusch. It's especially good to see him using a format which retains elements of anthology but stays together as a single story  albeit one which ultimately chooses character study over a perfectly sewn-up plot. Some viewers may be frustrated by the inconclusiveness of the ending. I don't think the film could end any other way and remain true to the character  the tone  or the vision. It's a little downbeat from start to finish  and you either buy it or you don't. I bought it. Jeffrey Wright was very funny and warm  Sharon Stone plays trailer trash perfectly  fine cameos by Jessica Lange (as an 'animal communicator')  Julie Delpy  Chloe Sevigny  and Tilda Swinton (cast against type as a biker chick.) Plus Alexis Dziena as the Lolita to end all Lolitas  whom I would gladly see more of (in a manner of speaking).\tThis is the kind of movie critics love  film majors swoon over  and the rest of us can't get too excited about.I see it as an exercise in minimalism. Given a talented star and supporting cast  a known director  cool soundtrack music  and a green light from the studio  can you make a successful movie with a minimalist script? A script that doesn't contain much? That gives the star precious few lines and instructs him to show as little emotion as possible? That gives the next-door neighbor a much more interesting character? After seeing it  I'm thinking  well  it's different  it's OK  but I don't consider it a great movie  or a successful movie  or even one I'll want to see again. I don't recommend that you go out and pay $9.00 to see it.\tSpare me. This movie is well directed and well paced. The inner core of a man's soul  a man's feelings  and what it will take for that man to reach these. But this movie  with all it's awkward silences  awkward moments and awkward characters........just leads you to an awkward ending. So the man can feel again  so the man thinks every young man is his son now. So what ? I was subdued for the ride in this movie. I loved the scene where he is standing outside his motel room in the early morning......listening and watching the world go by around him. Busy.......but peaceful. The director reaches the audience in so many ways with this film  but then falls flat on his face with an ending that is one of those \""thought provoking\"" or \"" making his point\"". Just shut up already. End the movie with just that. An ending!! You develop likable and intriguing characters  don't utilize them  and then end it with hokey pokey.Come on Bill  great acting  great story.........but no direction. Slap the director next time and tell him to have some backbone and finish his movie the right way.\tBill Murray changed his facial expression only once that I can remember during the entire movie. He moves like a robot. Like Lost in Translation  his character moves from scene to scene  place to place  apparently only because his friend Winston tells him to  and then he comes home  gets back in his jogging suit and goes back to his apparently pointless life. It is not ever clear  and possibly only barely suggested  that anything at all is changing in his mind or his heart. I take that back. Heart is barely suggested. He seems like someone who has been injected with Novocaine throughout his body. An extremely boring movie.\tAm I the only one who judges a movie by how I feel when I leave the theater. The movie itself might be imperfect  might have a few sections that drag on a tad  or are cut a bit short  but all in all the sharp reflections on life color my own life when I leave the theater and stop and get an ice cream; blueberry swirl on a regular cone perhaps  maybe some jimmies.We meet Don  Winston and his family and the women Don has \""known\"" (real estate saleswoman  animal communicator  closet reorganizer and biker chick in sticks)and mentally dissect the patterns in which their individual lives are constructed. It makes one think of their own life (me at least) and how we have a choice in the direction our lives are going and how it can lead to happiness  unhappiness or ennui. (Some people might disagree with me and think the couple who sell real estate in the Mcmansion are happy  but they would be a little fruity now wouldn't they.) And then we meet the hungry young man in front of the diner  with his sad angry eyes and gruff manner  and I really want to get to know the guy  where he's been  what's he's been through. We don't get to  and neither does Don  and I think that is sort of the point.It was great to see Don come alive at the end  running after the kid that might be his son. Even if he didn't get himself an instant Mcfamily on his road trip  at least he achieved a desire to rethink the patterns in his life  and direction he is going in.All in all a great film  a nice walk home  and some great ice cream:)"""
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),"If you are going to see this movie and looking for a recreation of \Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\"" then stop now. Time Burton phenomenally directs this movie with amazing sets and design. The world of the chocolate factory is breath-taking. The amazing contrast between the drab city and the vibrant factory is one of the many stunning visual effects.The children in this movie are back with just as terrible  if not more so  personalities. Charlie is also extremely well played and fully portrays the Charlie from before.The main difference in Tim Burton's version is Depp's idea of Wonka. Wilder makes Wonka out to be a cynical and tormented man. Depp describes Wonka as a child who only grew in physical size. He constantly swings from a serious tone to bitterly sarcastic to completely delusional. His character mirrors that of a child forced to live as an adult. Many people have compared this portrayal of Wonka to Michael Jackson. This comparison has some merit as both seem to be trapped in their childhood  but this does not demerit the performance at all. Just because such a likeness exist does not mean the Willy Wonka should not have been played as such.Tim Burton also fleshes out the movie by adding the background of Wonka and a short segment about the history behind the Oompa Loompas. Wonka's twisted beginnings truly demonstrate why he has turned into such a clash between childhood and adulthood.Another addition of Tim Burton are the new songs for the Oompa Loompas. Instead of the stagnant tunes from \""Willy Wonka and the Chocalate Factory\""  multiple short songs from various genres are played. All completely choreographed to fit with the genre  these scenes are a great laugh for those who have seen the original.*SPOILIER START* Tim Burton even injects a very funny exchange of dialogue criticizing who the dance and song by the Oompa Loompas seems setup and planned.*SPOILER END*This movie is an excellent view and I completely recommend seeing it. It provides a much fuller movie experience and covers the background and explains the future of Charlie; this is a large bonus as the original lacked any background or future. If I could I would give the movie 9.5 out of 10 because there were only a few points where the movie could have been slightly tweaked. The scene where Charly brings home the ticket just seemed to have some awkward dialogue. But by these ratings I will give it a 9  because 10 is reserved for perfection.To reiterate  this movie is a great new experience even for those who have seen the original. But if you are just looking for a new version with revamped visuals  don't waste your money. Compared to the original  \""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\"" is an amazing experience  surpassing the original as an entire movie.\tWow!!!! What a phenomenally amazing movie!!! I have long been a fan of the book  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  and the first \""Willy Wonka\"" movie. That being said  I must say that I enjoyed \""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\"" twice as much as the 1971 version. To begin with  the current version is more visually appealing. The sets were bright and colorful  and more in line with what you might expect from a reclusive genius' workplace. I loved the back story explaining Willy's great love for chocolate and why he was so determined to make it big in the chocolate business. But all of that would be meaningless if the acting was less than great. Fortunately  all of the performances were tremendous!!!! No kidding!!!! Every single one  from Charlie's bed-ridden grandparents to the chocolate master himself. Most notably  Freddie Highmore was cute as a button from his mud spattered high-water pants to his adorable dimpled cheeks. He brought a purity and innocence to his role that was very genuine. All of the other kids were deliciously annoying  as were their parents  which made you realize why the kids were so disgustingly bratty. The oompa-loompas were a scream  and I thought replicating one person to portray lots of oompa-loompas was a very clever and creative touch. The musical numbers were hilarious  without the in your face moralism of the 1971 variety. But I save my greatest praise for Willy Wonka himself  the truly great Johnny Depp. I know he seemed a little creepy  but wouldn't anyone be after being alone in a chocolate factory for 15 years with nothing but oompa-loompas for company?!!? Johnny Depp provided just the right amount of weirdness and sensitivity to the role and has proved himself again to be one of the greatest actors of our time. Mr. Depp never disappoints!!! This movie was a treat for so many reasons. I was very happy to see that Tim Burton toned down the tunnel ride. Fans of the '71 version will know what I mean. \""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\"" was pure pleasure from beginning to end! I will see it again in the theater and be the first in line to purchase the DVD!!! Excellent movie  all the way around!!!\tUnnecessary  redundant  pointless. I don't know what's the deal with Hollywood  but remakes aren't cutting it. Burton already has the equally mediocre and equally pointless \""Planet of the Apes\"" remake on his resume. This movie premieres in a summer where other 70s movies like \""The Bad News Bear\"" \""The Amityville Horror\"" and \""The Longest Yard\"" are being brought back for no reason other than Hollywood seems to have run out of ideas.Doesn't mean \""Charlie\"" is a total disaster. It has many things that are possibly better than \""Willie\"". But  if you have seen both  you can imagine anyone asking this question: \""Why bother?\"". Honestly  I was bored in the middle of the movie. I didn't leave the theater because I try to watch a complete film no matter what  but nothing could fix the feeling.I can tell Hollywood that I read  and there are plenty of good stories out there yet to be told. If they have the courage to go for the next original hit  instead of giving people the same old stuff because it is already proved successful  they'll see the audiences erode. I am one who has bowed not to see remakes anymore after the release of the (second!) remake of \""King Kong\"".\tthis has to be one of the worst movies i have seen this year (maybe ever). it seems that lately johnny depp has been exploring his feminine side (see 'pirates') but this is ridiculous! 'willy' could have easily passed for 'wilma'. it was a terrible 'take' on this character. the movie just wasn't funny. i didn't laugh once. i could hear the audience's fake chuckling during all of the 'gee  they meant this to be funny so i better laugh' parts. it was sad. the flashbacks to willy's upbringing were idiotic and added nothing to the story. it was what it was - filler. i could go on and on about this stinker but i won't due to time constraints. the saddest thing about this mess was the total disregard for the main idea in the book (and the first movie). that willy was in search of a child pure of heart to run his company. remember slugworth offering a reward for any 'gob stopper' that the children would give him (against willy's orders)? then charlie gives the gob stopper back to willy instead of slugworth  giving up untold riches - and proving he was honest and had the utmost integrity. it was the best part of the book and it still brings a tear to my eye. the new movie doesn't even touch upon this all-so-important life lesson. that honesty and integrity bring the biggest riches. but i will give credit where credit is due  and there was one thing i did like about the movie. the final credits - as this was the sign that i could finally leave the theater.\tI knew the reviews on this flick were going to be split 50/50 love/hate. So I'll try to stick one in the middle.For lovers of the original  do not go into this movie expecting the Wilder version. You WILL be disappointed. The similarities will make you expect the same warm feelings  but for some reason  you might leave the theater cold  and maybe angry.It was a colorful film  and there was some good acting  but the menacing  mysterious Wonka is definitely missing. Maybe it wasn't Depp's fault  but with the combination of makeup  script  and character development  we end up with what everyone else is calling a androgynous Jacko-Wonka. Depp doesn't have that semi-psychotic explosiveness that Wilder's Wonka had. Depp's character is more true to the book  but let's face it  Wilder's Wonka makes the audience fear and love him at the same time. With Depp  you have a non threatening wise cracking  high pitched Wonka. Adults will make the connection to Michael Jackson  but it is doubtful that the kiddies will. Highmore does an excellent job with Charlie  and isn't as annoying as the original Charlie. His family also has more interaction. As far as the kids: Augustus was improved  much funnier; Veruca ..well  honestly the original Veruca definitely seemed more like a spoiled little brat  so you were happier to see her go; Mike TV is annoying in both films  however  I kinda liked the original's Jay Leno-ish lisp. The implementation of video games for the new Mike will probably connect better with kids though; Violet was definitely improved  and her mom was just creepy  but thats good.The beloved familiar songs are gone  and while the lyrics of the new soundtrack might be clever and humorous  the accompanying music is too loud and cluttered to hear it. While I was watching  I noticed that most songs ended without a chuckle from the audience  and I attribute that to them being inaudible. The effects were well done  a nice surprise in this era of crap CGI laziness in Hollywood. The Oompas are all the same character  which honestly doesn't really bug me that much. The music is what let me down. I like the background on the Oompas  it added a little fresh air to the movie  and gave you something new  and not redone.You definitely get a little more knowledge of Wonka's background as well as Charlie's family  including a dad that was not present in the first flick. I thought the background story was good  however  it was not presented in a timely fashion. It's hard for this film to compete with the original  just on nostalgic value alone. The original is a bona fide classic  and even though technology has changed  it is not the most important factor. Especially in a movie that is supposed to tug at your heart strings  as well as dazzle your eyes.Children will love it  and maybe cherish it when they are older  as the older generations now cherish the '71 version. But us older folks might leave the theater disappointed  noticing Hollywood's greedy hands as they stick their hands in our pockets while trying to distract us with 'amazing' CGI. Don't get me wrong  like I said before  the CGI was good  and the sets were great  but there was something missing  something needed to draw you in and captivate your imagination. I went into this with a solid confidence that if anyone could or should redo the original  the Burton/Elfman/Depp crew were the ones to do it. I've been a huge fan of the trio since I can remember  and have had  and will continue to have faith in their creativity and vision. Corpse Bride looks awesome  and I'm sure Burton will redeem himself with that one.This is a delicate anomaly of a movie to review  so I'll end with this: Don't see it if you want to see a new  improved original. See it if you are taking your kids and family. The joy that they will get from it might stir up the joy you got from the original  just in case the new one doesn't tickle your fancy.\tComparing this to the first movie is like comparing Grape Juice and Wine. Though similar completely different.You would have thought Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was written specifically for Tim Burton to make it. Not sugar coated and Happy and Cheerful as the first one. This delves into more of Why Willy Wonka is the way he is. Explains why Charlie takes his grandfather rather than anyone else. Over all an excellent movie good for kids better for Adults in the humor department. Very Visually stimulating. The problem with the first movie is it explained nothing. It was more of this is just the way it is  the only scene that didn't make since was the boat scene  that was the only real glimpse into Willy Wonka.Highly recommend if you want to know more of the actual story.\tI am not a huge fan of Depp  but when I saw that Freddie Highmore was in it  I decided it might as well be worth a try. Highmore performed magnificently in this film  as I knew he would due to his performance in \""Finding Neverland.\"" I thought that there was no way that Depp could beat Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka  but boy did he come close. The one disappointment I had was the oompa loompas. Deep Roy is creepy  and the oompa loompas look nothing like the original! The music they sung was awful compared to the first movie. The surreal make up and sets were like a dream. I loved the airbrush look of Willy Wonka and a few of the children. This movie has almost exceeded its successor.\tI was actually excited to see this movie  I wasn't expecting anything  I was just intrigued to see another Tim Burton film. The pictures in the film and the factory were spectacular and mesmerizing. Without even paying attention to the story line it was clear this was a Tim Burton film  truly fantastic. But Like watching a model trying to ponder physics  the beauty is only skin deep. Where was the heart in this movie? The acting  the dialog  the people all fell short of human behavior. Small example: A child spoiled all her life only taunts her father with the resounding demand: \""I want it Daddy.\"" Where's the yelling  the screams  has no one EVER SEEN a tantrum?? Additional Example: The parents seemed hardly upset with their children's misfortune. As a parent would you not run out and help your daughter if she were attacked by ANYTHING much less squirrels?!The Ompa Loompa problem: I loved them actually. Tiny  creepy  and what a great story on how they were found. They were great until they broke into a bad Britney spears song and dance. What the #*!$*#& was that?!Flashback problem: I loved johnny's character  quirky and fun. Nevertheless  the flashbacks didn't add much at all to anything. And they were executed in the WORST WAYS i've ever seen. \""sorry I was having a flashback.\"" They are far better ways to have had those worked honestly.The T.V. kid: was he really so horrible? I mean yes  he was obnoxious  but it doesn't take t.v. to do that. In fact  didn't t.v. just make him smart? Is it so awful that he figured out how to find the bar with the ticket? T.V. didn't turn his mind to mush  it made him the smartest kid who was just annoying and stubborn.The ending: Horrible  horrible  horrible. I don't even want to talk about it.\tCharlie And The Chocolate Factory will be labeled and looked at as (what most movie fans fear) a remake. However it's not. It's not even close to the original which starred Gene Wilder and is one of my top 100 favorite films of all time. Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory was so far off form the book which was written by Rohl Dahl that Dahl (Who was rumored to detest the original) refused to sign off for a sequel. If Dahl was alive today he would have been very happy with Burton's version. It is practically word for word  scene for scene just like the book of the same name. The plot is simple. Willy Wonka is a candy god. The world worships him. Then for reasons which I will not explain because that would spoil the movie for you he closes his candy factory forever. Then out of the clear blue he decides that he is not only going to open the doors again but he is going to allow five lucky children to tour his factory  something that has never been allowed before. He runs this contest by putting five golden tickets in his Wonka Bars. The five lucky kids are Augustis Gloop a heavy kid from Germany who lives  breathes  and sleeps for chocolate. Tehn we have Violet Borogard. A little girl from Atlanta Georgia who's motto is winning is everything. She hates finishing any place but the top. Then we have Veruca Salt. A spoiled little rich girl from Birmingham  England. She has a father who's opinion on the world is money can buy everything. There's also Mike Tevee who's life revolves video games. He's a snot nosed punk who will stop at nothing to insult  cut down  or humiliate anyone in his path. Then finally we have Charlie Bucket. A bright little boy who has the heart of gold. He lives in a shack with his parents and his four grandparents. They barely have any money to put food on the table. Charlie is extremely tight with his Grandpa Joe. Who fascinates Charlie with his stories of Willy Wonka. Charlie is the one child who wants this prize more than anybody and deserves it because unlike all the other spoiled brats in the film Charlie is a working class blue collar kid who you just can't help but feel bad for. After the tickets are found the children meet the man who is their hero. Willy Wonka himself played by Tin Burton alumni Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands  Ed Wood  Sleepy Hollow  and the upcoming animated Burton film The Corpse Bride)who holds his own as Mr. Wonka. Milly is nothing what these kids think he's going to be. He's rude  brash  and a complete wise ass. In one scene when Violet throws her arms around him and says \""I'm Violet Borogard\"" Wonka looks down at her with an uncomfortable expression and replies \""I don't care\"". The chocolate factory is a child's imagination come to life and no one has an eye for eye candy the way Tim Burton does. If you've never seen a Burton film then check out Beetle Juice  Edward Scissorhands  Sleepy Hollow  or The Nightmare Before Christmas and you'll see what I mean. This movie has restored my faith in Burton when \""remaking\"" a classic (although as i said before this film is not a remake) but I'm a Burton junkie and have loved all his movies  yes even Planet of the Apes (yes I'm the one). After the debacle that was Planet Of The Apes (2000) it looked like Burton's career was over. The movie was a bomb and loathed by most fans that saw it basically giving a lot of heat about the ending (although P.O.T.A. has a better ending than the recent War Of The Worlds remake I've been told)but Burton bounced back with the masterpiece Big Fish. He hasn't dropped the ball since. Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is one of Tim Burton's best films and has great eye candy as well as laugh's with Depp's Wonka and the Oompa Loompa's (all played by one man who's been CGI'd to make millions of Oompa Loompa's) and the songs in the films are funny as hell. As for Depp  he hold's his own as Willy Wonka. Believe me he has some big shoes to fill from Gene Wilder's Wonka. However as I said before this movie is so different from the original it falls into the apples and oranges category. It's hard to compare which one is better. The original is still a great film that I will always love. Burton's version ranks right up there with it. Burton's version is almost scene for scene  word for word just like the book. The original is not even close. Which is why I can't even compare the two as well as tell you who was the better Willy Wonka. Again apples and oranges. If you want a good time at the movies where you can just leave your brain at the door and get lost in a weird  wonderful world then i highly recommend Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. Burton fans will love it. It ranks up there with Sleepy Hollow  Mars Attacks  Beetle Juice  Edward Scissorhands  and Big Fish. Even people that have never seen a Burton film (Pee-Wee's Big Adventure  Beetle Juice  Batman  Edward Scissorhands  Batman Returns  The Nightmare Before Christmas  Ed Wood  Mars Attacks  Sleepy Hollow  Planet Of The Apes  Big Fish and the upcoming Corpse Bride) will have a tough time not enjoying Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. It's a great time at the movies. Heck you'll find yourself wanting to go by candy as soon as the credits begin to roll. On a scale of 10 I give Charlie And The Chocolate Factory a 10. Go and enjoy. You won't regret it.\tWell.I've heard so many bad remarks about this movie.so I'm gunna say what i think. I've had the pleasure of reading the book and the displeasure of seeing the original. In my opinion this version totally out does the crappy Gene wilder version. the oompalompas actually all look alike their not any freakish colors there's no creepy tunnel scene.and not nearly as much singing *thank god* singing is OK but to much is a bad thing.and the songs they do have in this version are much much better.This movie also tells things that the original doesn't.i mean jeez. It explains why willy is such a recluse why he has no family.explains what happens after they get into the elevator.the original...it was like all that happens is they get in the elevator and thats that. I find this movie one of Burtons Best films yet. also compared to the last movie...this one is way more heartfelt.in my opinion anyways.... and plus johnny depp is a much better actor then gene wilder.\tSorry Johnny but that was awful....Boring  shallow and Depp's Wonka was very  very weird to coin a phrase.From the burning dolls at the start of the tour right through to the strange inability to say 'parents' this film has lost all the charm  wit and guile of Dahl's book.The Oompa Loompa's did not work at all  the songs were dreadful and as others have said very hard to understand lyrically. The boat ride was poor and could have been done much better - even the special effects over 30 years ago did a better job. Should have cut out the Wonka family moments and spent more time developing the characters in my opinion. I know the '71 Wilder Willy Wonka was not true to the book  however  at least he had 'character' unlike Depp's two dimensional portrayal.Please save your dosh  buy the book and the '71 version instead.\tDirector Tim Burton brings his vividly imaginative style to the beloved Roald Dahl classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  about eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka (JOHNNY DEPP) and Charlie Bucket (FREDDIE HIGHMORE)  a good-hearted boy from a poor family who lives in the shadow of Wonka's extraordinary factory.Most nights in the Bucket home  dinner is a watered-down bowl of cabbage soup  which young Charlie gladly shares with his mother and father and both pairs of grandparents. Theirs is a tiny  tumbledown  drafty old house but it is filled with love. Every night  the last thing Charlie sees from his window is the great factory  and he drifts off to sleep dreaming about what might be inside.For nearly fifteen years  no one has seen a single worker going in or coming out of the factory  or caught a glimpse of Willy Wonka himself  yet  mysteriously  great quantities of chocolate are still being made and shipped to shops all over the world.One day Willy Wonka makes an announcement. He will open his famous factory and reveal \""all of its secrets and magic\"" to five lucky children who find golden tickets hidden inside five randomly selected Wonka chocolate bars. Of course  Charlie finds one of the tickets  and the surprises awaiting him within the factory give Charlie a certain glow inside.Tim Burton has done it again.This 'Charlie' is a considerable improvement on the film it remakes  'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'. Tim Burton's imagination gives the film a splashy look to it anf filling it with remarkable sights. Actor Johnny Depp is fantastic as offbeat and eccentric kid-at-heart Willy Wonka. Freddie Highmore gives a magical performance as the generous  curious Charlie  the poor boy eager to win a trip into Willy Wonka's factory.The remarkable thing about this 'Factory' is how visually stunning it is. Tim Burton lusciously imagined the film  and it's a feast for the eyes... and the imagination. Screenwriter John August fills the film with a subverse sense of humor and wit  and creates a number of hilarious characters. Overall: A Fantastic Effort.4 from 4 PG: quirky situations  brief language and some mild action.\tI've seen it a couple of days ago and I loved it!!!! I thought Johnny D could never play Willy Wonka as good as Gene Wilder did in the old version. Actually i thought it would be a rip-off of some kind that it would be just the same as the old one but with new actors. I was wrong. I went because a friend and I wanted to go to a movie but there wasn't something really exciting in the cinema close by so alright  why not  it's a nice day for a movie so we'll just go. We laughed a lot because it was pretty funny. I think Johnny D did great. It's not like the old version  they've changed a lot. I saw it in dutch because it didn't play in English yet  normally I don't like movies spoken in dutch but this time i did. Good movie. An 8 at least!!!!!\tI couldn't stand the first film adaptation of Dahl's book  so I was a bit reluctant to see the newer one. I ended up loving every second of it. It's hardly disturbing at all  and crazily fun to watch. Even the Oompah Loompahs were cool. I totally recommend this movie and give it nine out of ten stars (the missing star is for the continuity mistakes  which thankfully aren't very noticeable). Johnny Depp does a great performance as Willy Wonka  and I was very pleased overall with the \""dark atmosphere\"" that Tim Burton's directing gave to it. Dark  but not disturbing or scary--that's the way to do it! There's even some humorous scenes to lighten the mood. Needless to say I walked out with a craving for chocolate.\tI wasn't too happy when I heard that Tim Burton was remaking WILLY WONKA  or should I say  re-adapting Roald Dahl's book CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY  and the initial previews didn't make me feel any better. But  I went to see it with an open mind  and was pleasantly surprised.At first.The first twenty minutes are great. The introduction of all the characters is often hilarious  even surpassing the original movie at times. Violet and Mike are somewhat re-vamped  while Augustus and Veruca are basically identical  but the kids who play them are all very funny.But when we finally get to the Chocolate Factory  things immediately go downhill. There are some amusing effects and cool set design  but the spirit of the original movie  and Dahl's original story  are absent. The movie just moves from one bigger  more elaborate version of the original set-pieces to the next  with no inspiration and no new spin.Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka is mind-boggling. What is this character supposed to be? An adult child? A clueless shut-in? Or just a generic weirdo? Depp brings nothing to the character  he just talks like Mr. Rogers' psycho cousin and makes a lot of funny faces  somehow managing to come off as wooden. Gene Wilder played the character like a mysterious genius who knew more than he was telling his guests. Depp plays the character like a goofy buffoon who's simply a poor host.The actor who plays all of the Oompa-Loompas is funny for about one minute  then that joke grows increasingly tiresome. By the time he's dressed up like a rock star doing pinwheels  it's just plain stupid.The screenplay is very lazily written. Situations pop up in the story which then go nowhere  such as Violet and Veruca sharing a private glance at the mention of Ever-Lasting Gobstoppers  but then nothing coming of it. It's as though the writer decided to get rid of anything he felt was extraneous to the plot; in other words  he wanted to get to the next special effects sequence quickly  and keep that pesky plot as bare-to-the-bones as possible. It's obvious the filmmakers feel that their audience wants flashing lights and pretty colors  not an interesting story.And that is the problem with CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. There's no shortage of things to look at  but once the novelty of that wears off  there's nothing more to it. Even a subplot involving Chirstopher Lee as Wonka's father is thrown in almost as an afterthought  then tossed aside as soon as it's served its purpose. Like so many Hollywood extravaganzas  there's a lot of CGI pizazz and mumbo-jumbo  but no soul.The best I can say for CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is that it is better than Burton's PLANET OF THE APES. Then again  so was PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.\tTim Burton misses the mark... again. Here is a story that it seems to me would be difficult to ruin: a kid's movie about magical chocolate. The movie starts off well enough. We are introduced to Charlie's family and town and learn about the Chocolate factory. The finding of Charlie's ticket to visit the factory slowly lumbers towards its inevitable conclusion. This is my first complaint that the finding of the ticket was not serendipitous but treated as if desire can influence reality (remember kids  you can win the lottery so long as if you really  really want to win). OK. So what. It's forgivable. The story moves on and we find ourselves on a tour of the factory. For a while things are fine and then with one new plot device -- the elevator -- things go completely downhill. Now effects rather than character take over the story (I don't call them special effects because it's not often anymore that they 'wow' us... they are ordinary effects). The characters also act completely unnatural during some of these scenes (i.e.  the parents and Wonka just sit back and watch barely concerned as their children do dangerous things). Anyway  the movie goes on until the end. There's no point about it except the most clich\u00e9 of moral lessons \""your family is important\"".The kids in the theater laughed a few times (but not as much as they have the potential for). As an adult  I laughed twice. Once was at a pretty good joke  I must admit  about what's edible. The other was at something that wasn't intended to get a laugh.Oh  regarding Wonka  what a strange dude! He's got problems... real problems.\tFirst I must start out by saying \""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\"" is my all time favorite movie. There I said it  now lets talk about this Luke warm attempt at a re-make.Loved Johnny Depp  the trailers don't do him justice  but he does give Willy a creepy Michael Jackson quality.The movie starts off really wonderfully  I was excited to hear the kids reactions when there was no golden ticket and when there was. It gives me a warm fuzzy to hear those innocent reactions to story they haven't heard yet. So that said....The factory. Tim Burton can not tell a story or convey the magic of the original. He even said in an interview he never liked the original and also wanted to remake the story. He needs to go back and read the book and find the story. His transitions are boring and uneventful. His characters are lost and unlikeable. Unlikeable  but we really don't care what happens whether their good or bad.A friend summed up this movie in a nutshell. \""Image visiting a house you grew up in  it's been remodeled and new"
Cinderella Man (2005),"Ron Howard and Russell Crowe have something going on. As Kauffman and Hart were to the screwball comedy  as Rogers and Hammerstein were to the Broadway musical  and as Burns and Allen were to banter comedy  Howard and Crowe should go down in entertainment history as the team that perfected the biographical movie. As an encore to their amazing collaboration in \A Beautiful Mind\"" the actor/director team has created a brooding  harrowing  and soulful journey through a slice of the life of boxer Jimmy Braddock  an unlikely heavyweight champ of the depression wracked 1930's. Given the success of \""Cinderella Man\"" it seems apparent that this is a franchise in the making. The movie itself is simple. It follows a relatively short time in the life of boxer Braddock and his family and does not rely on an entire lifetime to make its point. No study of childhood psychological baggage here. It is very simply the gritty nature of Braddock's quest  the interplay between him  his wife  his kids and his always supportive manager  and the oppression of the era that are the recipe that makes this move a compelling work. Set during a period in our history where the real consequences of the Great Depression are oftentimes either ignored or caricaturized  Howard pulls no punches in depicting the inhumanity of that slice of our history. Using an almost sepiaesque tone to the color  an era of gloom and doom is aptly created  throwing the viewer into a realistic reality of calamity. We are even taken on a not so pretty tour of \""Hoover Ville\"" in 1930's Central Park that cannot help but move even the most stalwart of movie goers. Effectively using this as his backdrop  Howard paces the film so that the last hour is literally breathtaking as we follow Braddock through his final trek toward and into the title fight. The fight scenes themselves are remarkable in their ability to get the audience involved in each. Even with full knowledge of the outcome  Braddock's journey is exciting and suspenseful. This is great film-making. Crowe is quite simply a great actor. His chameleon like ability to \""become\"" is a joy to experience. Together with his character we feel his frustration  his angst  and almost overwhelmingly  his pain  both physically and emotionally. When he has to ask for public assistance and is forced to \""beg\"" from boxing fat cats so as not to break a promise to his little boy that he would never send him away to live in their desperate times  it is almost excruciating to watch. We feel what he feels  we know what he knows  and we hurt like he hurts. This is great acting.The supporting cast is great also. Rene' Zellweger is understated as ever in her long suffering support of the title character. She has the ability to pull us equally into the story and creates a great role out of a weakly written part. She is truly the great woman behind this man. Equally effective in his role is Paul Giamatti as Braddock's manger. He is always there for Braddock. He seems almost like a guardian angel in his \""never say die\"" demeanor  and his quest to continue Braddock's career. When he tells Braddock that they are revoking his license  we feel all the pain associated with having to break bad news to those we care about. His exuberance during the final fight is contagious. Craig Bierko as killer fighter Max Baer and Paddy Considine as Braddock's friend on the docks also turn in excellent performances.As Howard continues to prove himself a truly great director  Crowe continues to pad his resume' with meaty and heartfelt performances in the vein of the best movie actors like Brando  Bogart  and Stewart. Mr. Crowe's ability to re-create himself in the context of every character he tackles puts him in a very small class with a very high caliber of movie actor. Howard just might be the consummate \""actor's\"" director. His ability to glean stellar performances out of every actor in his movies from the smallest walk across to his biggest stars is nothing short of phenomenal  and certainly no fluke. Over and over again  Howard has proved himself. \""Cinderella Man\"" will take it's place on his already prestigious resume' as one of his best  and hopefully this will not be the last we see of these two working together.\tWashed up boxer Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) is longing for another chance at the glory he once had. With the help of his manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) he is given one more shot at the belt. He goes up against Max Baer. Baer has already killed two men in the ring. Will Jim be the third? \""Cinderella Man\"" is a truly spectacular picture with supporting roles from Renee Zellwegger and Craig Bierko. Films like this show us that a second chance is possible. All you need is hope. Someone deserves and Oscar.\""Cinderella Man\"" is rated PG-13 for Intense Boxing Violence and Some Language.10/10\tGreat Ren\u00e9e performance. This is her best performance in all her career. She is his supportive wife  but not like the other ones. She really is fantastic! The Movie is not like the other boxing movies. I really love it. I'm not a huge fan of the cast  but they really did it. Ron Howard make his best work on it. But I'm still thinking that Zellweger and Giammatti are the best in the movie. I think this is the BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR! Can you imagine two consecutive boxing Oscars! Ren\u00e9e Zellweger gives realism to the movie and her role is very compasive  strong and beautiful. Giammatti is fantastic too  making his best performance. i think he deserve the nomination  just like Ren\u00e9e.\tMaybe it is because I am an avid fan of the sport  but these past few years have really been fun for me at the box office. Two huge boxing box office pictures(try and say that three times fast). As seen in Cinderella Man  this is a sport that can either make or break a human. Jim Braddock was the epitome of what this magnificent sport means. You may be standing in your local supermarket and the man standing next to you could be the welterweight champion of the world. You wouldn't even know. That is the beauty of boxing. It lacks all of the glamour and glitter of all the other major sports(for the most part). This is and always will be a blue collar sport  as illustrated in the movie.O.K- Now to talk about the movie. Jim Braddock was a fighter during the Great Depression. He not only had to fight in the ring  but to feed his wife and children as well. I wont go on about all of the magnificent dialogue and very well choreographed fight scenes(they put a punching bag on the lower part of the camera for Crowe to punch to give a more realistic affect). I will. however  leave you with one of my personal favorite scenes in the movie. After Braddock(Crowe) hits rock bottom financially  he goes back to the boxing commission and has to literally beg for money. Boxing fan or not  this movie is a must see for anyone.\t(watched in Toronto)Based on the life of heavyweight champion James Braddock (Russell Crowe)  Cinderella Man is a semi-fictional tale told in simple  good old fashion narrative form  a story on courage and human dignity in face of adversity. After a brief opening scene of Braddock at the height of fame and fortune  the movie losses no time is plunging him right into the vicissitudes during the Depression era  when  suffering from a broken hand  he can hardly bring in enough to feed his family  working as a longshoreman. Director Ron Howard does not shy away from taking us very slowly  in this 2-and-a-half-hour movie  through the most desperate struggles of James and Mae (Renee Zellweger) Braddock. The second half of the movie is on Braddock's miraculous comeback  \""from the breadline to contesting for the heavyweight championship title within a year\"" thereby becoming the inspiration for people losing all hope during the depression.One could look at this movie as a period piece  against the backdrop of the American Depression era (and many have compared it to \""Seabiscuit\""). Cinderella Man however can be appreciated without any period reference. Poverty is universal. Not wanting to part with one's family is universal. Courage and human dignity are universal.With so many pugilistic movies that have gone on before (even Elvis Presley had \""Kid Galahad\"") you would really wonder what Ron Howard could do to make his finale memorable. Well  he did it by going all out  pulling all the plugs. In addition to what is happening in the ring  we see Braddock's children huddled in a basement cell listening to the radio broadcast of the match  against their mother's explicit prohibition (but soon joined by aunts and grannies  and a resigning mother). We also see Braddock's fans gathered around the radio in pubs as well as in church  and in the latter case the priest shadow-boxing at the critical moments  completely absorbed in the match. These cross cuttings have a multiplier effect (pardon an economic term) on what we see happening in the ring  pushing the audience to one emotional height after another  culminating in a gloriously uplifting finale.But the fight is actually over at around the middle of the movie. When Braddock stoops so low as to go  cap-in-hand  to the plush club where his former acquaintances have gathered to beg for nineteen dollars so that his kids do not have to be sent away to live with relatives  he has ironically reached the pinnacle of his dignity. The movie clearly shows this  as we see after this scene a changed man in Braddock  confident  truly cheerful but gentle and loving as ever. He has already won the fight.Crowe is not among my favourite male leads but this all-goodness persona he has adopted for this movie is truly likable. Inimitable Zellweger provides solid support and has good chemistry with Crowe. Better still is the spark between Crowe and Paul Giamatti playing his manager. The relationship is somewhat similar to (but not entirely alike) that between Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman's characters in \""Million Dollar Baby\""  a professional relationship forming the basis of genuine friendship. If I were a betting man  I would put my money of Giamatti getting at least a best supporting nomination for this year's Oscar  if not winning it.\tThis movie is a winner on most counts. Russell Crowe is amazing as the depression-era fighter James Braddock; his manager - played by Paul Giamatti is effective; and Bruce McGill holds his own against both. Even Ren\u00e9e Zellweger (who I sometimes find to be a bit affected) as his wife  has her moments and is very good. While something could be said about not really showing 'who' Jim Braddock was  by all accounts he was an uncomplicated man devoted to his family. So possibly  the movie was factual in not showing more. But the criticism is minor  and in all actuality does not take anything away from the film.And even though I knew the outcome  the suspense still built up in the final scenes  and provided a crowd pleasing ending that was not in the least bit contrived  maudlin  or false. Ron Howard has created anther fine film  and proves once again (as if he needed to) that he is a major directorial talent.\tpersonally  I like the screenplay of this movie  and it has to win the 2006 Academy award to best Adapted Screenplay  best actor in a leading role for Russell  and best actress in a supporting role for Rene\u00e9 (she's HOT!!) I also liked Paul Giamatti performance  because can do any role  and I liked his performance in Sideways and in Big fat liar. A real story that make us to break into tears  and gives us hope  faith and will. If it's possible  I hope this movie wins the Academy Award for the Best Picture. THE BEST!!! And  just to end my comment  I hope that this movie be in a better position in the top two hundred fifty movies  because it deserves to be in the position number 1  or at least in the top ten.\tA movie about James Braddock? Why not? He seemed like a good man  the salt of the earth  who overcomes all kinds of adversity to become the heavyweight champion. Not a bad story at all ... but so what? But if Hollywood is going to make a movie about boxing champions  how about making a movie about the life and career of Benny Leonard  arguably the greatest lightweight champion in the history of boxing? Or what about a movie about the life and career of Carlos Monzon  arguably the greatest middleweight champion in the history of boxing? Or what about a movie about the life and career of Barney Ross  who was world champion in three different weight classes and war hero? In fact  what about a movie about the life and times of Max Baer  who is portrayed as the \""bad guy\"" in the movie  and who  by the way  wore the Star of David on his trunks  so how bad could he be? In fact  if Baer was such a bad guy  how could he have been the father of Max Baer  Jr. who played Jethro Bodine on \""The Beverly Hillbillies\""? Any man who was the father of the actor who played Jethro Bodine could not have been all that bad of a guy. Max Baer was a boxer  boxing is a violent sport and naturally  and unfortunately  the contestants do get hurt or worse. But to imply that Max Baer was gratuitously violent is unfair  even for a movie. So  if you want to watch a movie about James Braddock  then this is probably the movie to watch  but don't come away thinking badly about Max Baer. Remember  if it wasn't for Max Baer  there may never have been a Jethro Bodine.\tGood performances by all (I particularly liked Paul Giamatti). Howard didn't not try to strangle the movie with smurfy moments with the kids. The boxing matches got the blood up. But... eh. No great lesson to learn about life (other than to not give up  to show tenacity in the face of adversity  blah  blah blah). Nothing to ponder upon. I think the genius of Howard is that with this incredibly formulaic story  he managed not to overly bog it down with schmaltz  or loose tension throughout the movie. But it is a real formulaic story.It gets a plus for not avoiding to show uglier aspects of the Depression. It gets a minus for lying about Max Baer in order to make him look more like a villain.Maybe its me. Maybe I need more existential angst in a movie. Maybe these glowing comment reviews with almost no negative ones irk me. I never did like Rocky. But Million Dollar Baby was a much better boxing movie. Its a disgrace that Cinderella Man got killed in the box office by junk like Revenge of the Sith  or the Longest Yard  but this movie does not belong in the top 250 list.\tThis film has placed itself in the category of cinematic perfection from almost all viewpoints and can be counted with it's fellow contenders on one hand. Mr. Howard has teamed up with the best and once again established himself as one of  or the best conventionally competitive director of our time. The triumphant story of Jim Braddock has facilitated Howard and his crew to deliver a film that provides closure and hope to all of us that it is still possible for an 'Pro-American' film to succeed in our society  when all other films undermine and desolate the kinship that once was characterized by innocence in this country. All the significant acting performances and technical production roles in the film have qualified for merits of high praise and have already reserved their niche in the very limited space for Oscar nominations. Although each years' largest Oscar contenders generally arrive in theaters close to the occasion  Cinderella Man has gained precedence in many categories over the more worthy films that are soon to arrive in theaters before February 06'. The following is an allegedly composed list of almost definite Academy Award nominations for this film:Best Picture - Ron Howard  Brian Grazer  Penny Marshal Best Director -Ron Howard Best Actor in a Leading Role - Russell Crowe Best Actor in a Supporting Role - Paul Giamatti Best Actress in a Leading Role - Ren\u00e9e Zellweger Film Editing - Mike Hill  Dan Hanley Cinematography - Salvatore Totino Costume Design - Daniel Orlandi Music (Original Score) - Thomas Newman Writing (Adapted Screenplay) - Screenplay by Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman Art Direction - Peter Grundy  Dan Yarhi Sound Editing - Eytan Mirsky  Daniel Pagan Sound Mixing - George A. Lara  John J. Thomson  Greg Steele\tWell well well  never did i think that i would ever be able to sit through a film looking at Russel Crowes smug face and actually like him in it. This film certainly proved me wrong.I only saw this movie last night at a movie mystery night at the local cinema  you buy and don't know what you are gonna see. This surprised me that Cinderella Man was to be on nearly a whole month before its UK release. As someone who is not a fan of Russel Crowe i groaned at the film as it was coming on  along with the missus sat next to me. However  within the first 20 minutes this film really had me hooked. It is the true story of Jimmy Bradock  a has been boxer who is now struggling through the depression  trying to support his family through the harsh times. He only has one real shot at staying above water and this is by fighting again  so with the help of his coach  Joe  gets one more fight.This film really gets you behind the guy  i found myself almost throwing every punch in the last fight with him. Russel Crowe gives an absolutely wonderful performance as Jimmy Bradock  looking back i am still not sure whether he is more likable purely because he is being punched in the face a lot  with the cast around him also giving solid performances making the film a hit in this reviewers eyes. It can only be a hit as i have nothing to moan about for onceHappy Viewing\tThis is brilliant movie - Not since Raging Bull has there been a film that takes you on a an emotionally charged roller coaster as this one. Itdemonstrates the human spirit and determination of a man who endures physical and mental hardship to become one of the greatest fighters. This a gem of a movie and easily rates alongside Raging Bull with fight scenes that make you wince. The other stars are equally superb and how this film missed out on Oscars I have no idea it is criminal that it was overlooked and more criminal if you miss a piece of movie brilliance. You will definitely not be disappointed it was like watching the rags and riches story of Rocky only it is a true story and the acting is top drawer. Russel Crowe does the character of Jim Braddock great credit and Ron Howard does a great job in making you feel that you were there with the hardships of the depression and the feeling of hope and this film fills you with every kind of emotion from start to finish - it is simply a gem.\t\""Cinderella Man\""  rated PG-13  is a solid four and a half \""popcorns\"". The 2005 drama  is brought to the big screen by the award winning director Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind  Apollo 13  How the Grinch Stole Christmas  EDtv  The Missing). With the outstanding performances of the trio: Russell Crow  Ren\u00e9e Zellweger  and Paul Giamatti  Howard brought yet another story to the big screen  loaded it with both tear-jerking and heart-swelling moments; packed it with honorable leading characters  and artistically conveyed good morals.I took my 16 year old friend  18 and 13 year old sisters  along with my 14 year old brother to see \""Cinderella Man\"". We all loved it. In our opinion it is the best movie of the year. Ron Howard brought a great story of perseverance  romance  drama  and action to moviegoers in \""Cinderella Man\"". This movie has great morals for all ages as it teaches you to never give up and keep pressing forward. It inspires men to be strong fathers and husbands no matter what happens and to teach their children right from wrong. The scene where Jim's son returns the stolen food also teaches people to be honest and that they should work for what they need. I would highly recommend this movie to anybody over 10 years old. Parents this is a boxing movie so the violence may be too intense in spots for younger viewers. There is some profanity in this movie that was not needed  however  there wasn't the use of the F-word in this movie like most of your PG-13 movies.The \""Cinderella Man\"" is a wonderful true story of a professional boxer  James J. Braddock (Russell Crow). Not only was he a great boxer  he was also an admirable father and husband dedicated to keeping his wife ( Ren\u00e9e Zellweger) and their three children together during the Great Depression. Over-due bills  electricity out and with only five dollars to his name  \""The Bulldog of Bergen\"" has all but lost his boxing bite and is scrambling for work alongside 15 million other unemployed Americans. Finally after a long time of despair  a little light shines though the darkness when Jim's boxing manager  Joe Gould( Paul Giamatti)  shows up out of the blue with a proposition. It turns out that the number two heavyweight in the world needs a last minute replacement to fight for $250. The fact that Jim has never been knocked out makes him an attractive story line. Sporting makeshift gloves and a fighter's robe with the wrong name on it  Jim is simply expected to show up  take a few hits and collect his paycheck. But the unexpected happens... Jim KO's his opponent! Jim now has new life breathed into his previously dismal existence  another chance. One victory leads to another ... and another and another ... until Jim has suddenly rekindled hope among the down-and-out Irish-American community rallying around its newfound underdog hero. Jim  now dubbed the \""Cinderella Man \"" is lined up to fight the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world  Max Baer( Craig Bierko)  an arrogant giant who has already killed two men in the ring.Again not like your average PG-13 or PG movie  \""Cinderella Man\"" has absolutely no sexual content. Men are shown smoking in some scenes. Parents this is one of the cleanest movies out there. It's powerful in its portrayal of life. \""Cinderella Man\"" is as powerful as its hero's punches.\tAll i can say is i have never been so sad for a movie to end in my life. By the time it was over all i could think was i wish there was more. This is certainly my favorite movie. I am 16 years old..and though I'm sure it was a older generation that went to see this movie  this film touched me in a way no other movie had done before. Russell Crowe is absolute wonderful in this film..and very handsome. If anyone ever doubted his acting abilities this film here shows that he is one of the best actors out there. All i can say is everyone..young and old  should go see this movie. It was a true inspiration to me and i hope it is to you to. I really hope to go see this again..and buy it whenever it comes out on video. Hopefully this review will come and handy and you will go see this movie. You wont regret spending your money on it...it is simply the best movie that was ever made. :)\tHow do you describe a movie of such caliber.I do not understand why it took so long for somebody to make a movie about the life of James Braddock. But I'm glad it fell into Ron Howard's hands. Once again Ron delivers an amazing movie with a script that works on so many different levels.But let's not leave out Russell Crowe and Renee Zelwegger who both deliver amazing performances about the hardships of the great depression and the values of family.By far one of the best movies I have ever seen.I can't wait for this year's Oscar Awards.\tWhen we were looking for a movie to see that particular evening a few months ago my wife protested that Cinderella MAN was a boxing film and that it would be better suited for my brothers buddies and myself. Well  we wound up going in anyway and  boy was she glad.While it's true that Cinderella MAN is a story of the prize ring  it is much more than that. It's a boxing story  a biography and a period piece as well as a love story of sorts.Now  that is not to say that the fisticuffs of the film were sub standard in any way. Both the demonstration of the \""Sweet Science\"" by the individual actors and the recreation of historical bouts from the depression era are all top notch. To start with it is based on the true story of one James J.Braddock who was a sort of Journeyman Light Heavyweight Boxer in the 1920's. Braddock had to give up his pugilistic career due to some recurring injury to his hand. Some time later  he gets back into the game and works his way up to the Heavyweight Crown. This is all common knowledge to most any sports fan.The film is also a great biopic in that it has been said to capture the essence of the real man. At times the character seems almost too good to be true. But those who knew him have insisted that the real man was as portrayed.As a \""Love Story\""  well love is all portrayed all throughout this story. We see the love and devotion of a man and woman to each other and to their family.The love of the children for their folks when the financial condition of the country and the whole world is at its very worst.And finally  the love of a public for a true champion for them to revere.Lastly  the film was a period piece. It paints a very good picture of the depression years and what it was (and still is) like to be among the working poor. Mr.Braddock was representative of that generation of people who bravely fought their way through the Great Depression  only to immediately face the dangers and come out victorous in World War II.\tMy friends  family and I have waited so long to see a film like this made  I must thank every person involved in its production. If it does not take every major award at the Oscars  Golden Globes  People's Choice  and every other contest  I will completely give up on Hollywood  because it will have failed to answer my needs. I go to the movies to escape  to learn something  and to be enriched. This film accomplished all that  and so much more. I was so grateful my two sons  ages 14 and 16 went with us. Going to the movies with your parents is so \""uncool\"" at those ages  but as we shared our popcorn and the root beer we knew we couldn't really afford  we learned so much about the reality of The Depression  the bond of family  the importance of integrity  and the lessons we have always taught our children about what is right and wrong  and why. Our daughter  Rachel Youngberg  knew from a very early age that her calling in life was to become an actor  and we fought her tooth and nail  knowing how corrupt and evil people can become here in Hollywood. After seeing this film  I came away proud of her decision to stay and fight to make great films like Cinderella Man. I finally see what she has been trying to tell me for the past 15 years--how film can lift the human spirit  teach others  and be a light to this war-torn world. Ron Howard proved it can be done  and I hope the next time he needs a convincing cast for a creative film  he'll give my daughter a chance to audition for him. You've come a long way  \""Opie\""  and when I see that Best Director Oscar in your hand  I will cry  but I will also pump the air with my fist  jubilate  and scream  \""Yes!\"" Your victory will feel like one for me  and one especially for my daughter. Long may you live  and direct and produce to your dying day  at the age of 129  or so.\tI must say that few movies in today's cinema world present the public with characters that can be admired  lauded  and emulated to the improvement of the real world. Granted  what people count as admirable or praiseworthy characteristics are about as diverse as the characters in today's cinema world (I am often reminded of the conversation between Commodus and Marcus Aurelius in \""Gladiator\"")  but I personally was impressed with and compelled by the character of Jim Braddock in \""Cinderella Man\"".Before I go too much more into Jim Braddock's character  I want to comment that I myself am a boxing fan in some respects  but the concept of boxing  if seriously pondered  leads me to conclude that making a sport out of two people harming one another with the purpose of causing enough damage to your opponent that he or she loses consciousness makes reason stare. But like Jim says in the movie  people die all the time but someone's found a way to make money off of it in boxing.Apart from the boxing part of the story  of which there is surprisingly little in the first half of the movie  I found the story of survival without moral compromise to be almost without equal in the film world today. Additionally  the fact that this is based on a true story makes Jim's character and the story of \""Cinderella Man\"" even more noteworthy.I watched with considerable discomfort and pain the suffering of that little family in the throes of the great depression. My emotional commitment was even greater as I watched Jim's optimism  self-sacrifice  and nobility pressed to their limits. I was moved as I watched him overcome each trial with humble  dignified determination. For me his character was polished with every challenge he faced and overcame  shining brighter and brighter as the film progressed.I loved this film because of Jim Braddock. Ron Howard's talent is remarkable  but I have found myself more compelled by the boxing in other films. But what this film has is a truly heroic character whose story happens to involve boxing. Had Jim Braddock been a basketball player or a skateboarder  I think the story would have  in many respects  worked just as well. For me  this movie isn't as much about boxing as \""Million Dollar Baby\"" or \""Rocky.\"" In this movie you watch Jim fight to survive outside of the ring more than you watch him fight inside the ring. But it's the story of this man's fights  and how relentless  punishing  and overwhelming those fights are  watching this everyman overcomes fight after fight  integrity intact  that makes this movie great.Jim Braddock is the kind of movie hero  and real world hero  that we need to see more of today. The quality of his character is of equal value  and I think greater need  today as it was in the 1930's. What a remarkable story. What a remarkable man.\tcome on  this movie is too very overrated.what was there in it  pathetic facial expressions from crowe from whom i never expected such a disaster. there is nothing in the movie that is worth seeing. the boxing scenes were horrible  no intense shots.the script is pale and lots of flaws if one reads the true story of nash.what was renee doing in the movie  god only knows  this movie for sure does not deserve what people have rated it to be. Ron Howard and Rusell Crowe gave Beautiful Mind  and then they stooped down to give a worthless cinderalla man.skip this movie.\tWow.. what a great movie..Russell Crowe really out did himself this time.. I'm impressed... this is the sort of movie where you're cheering in your seat.. Great movie.. I'm ready to go out and buy it... I'd watch it a million times.. the best and most simplest word to explain this movie would have to be magnific"
Closer (I) (2004),"Closer reveals the beautiful people being beautiful  or  lying liars and their lies. Another Mike Nichols portrayal of beauty in emotional distress  i.e.; Ann Margaret  Katherine Ross  Annette Benning  Sandy Dennis  Stockard Channing  Meryl Streep. A story of attraction and repulsion  Closer is well photographed with an interesting story and great casting. Urban London is a wonderful setting. From Nichols  who directed several of the finest American films of the '60s and '70s some of the most atrocious and embarrassingly bad dialog I can remember. All four characters are dishonest with each other and themselves  conniving  manipulative  and tormented by their own awful  immoral behavior. When Julia Roberts and Jude Law first kiss she presses the shutter release on the cable she is holding as though it's a metaphoric climax. I actually laughed out loud. Portman is the star of what could be her breakout film. The story also concludes well. Law's character is alone and discovers Portman's waif was never honest or really trusted him. Carnal Knowledge has been one of my favorite films since I first saw it in the seventies. There are similarities that would make this a suitable bookend to Nichol's career. Well worth seeing but by no means a major film.\tI admit to being a Mike Nichols fan. There's been some great stuff. I loved \Wit\"" and \""The Graduate\"" and even \""Primary Colors.\"" There's been some great filming and story-telling going on for just a little over 30 years from this guy  which leads me to the question: why this movie? Why \""Closer?\"" I can't imagine wanting to spend time making a movie about a bunch of people who are unpleasant  deceptive  and just down right mean. Even though the bulk of his work is about people you wouldn't normally like  at least his past characters provide some kind of redemption for themselves. They're not just unpleasant  deceptive and mean to each other; they do this to themselves. For example  if you were Clive Owen's character and you were in love with your wife  would you have sex with a prostitute while you were away on vacation? And then would you expect her to stay after you've confessed? And even more  would you expect that you'd end up okay in the end? How 'bout Jude Law's character? Every time he meets a woman that's newer  younger  and more out of his reach  he goes for her...even if he's seeing someone else. When he meets Alice  he's living with Ruby. When he meets Anna  he's living with Alice. He's not just unhappy with these women that he spends years with  but he is apparently unhappy with himself. Oh  and how \""ironic\"" that he happens to write obituaries. A bit clich\u00e9 for my taste. He was boring  unsettling  and worthless as a character.Then there's Anna. I imagine that Julia Roberts didn't have to do too much prep work for this role because she was already used to stealing people's beaus in real life. This one came naturally to her which begs the question how come she was such a bad actress in this film? I'm glad Cate Blanchett backed out and left this crummy role to a crummy over-rated actress. The best thing she can do is smile that \""epic\"" smile and look goofier as the years go by. Her character is not just boring  mean  and deceptive but also disgusting. Although Clive Owen's character was a total jerk  he had it right at the end when he said that total depressives keep looking for depression. Of course  that only raises the question why he would want her back if she will inevitably leave him again for something less happy? Or is that the point? Either way  I would have dumped her  screwed her  and left her at the end. Not dump her  screw her  and then take her back. Wouldn't the best reward for her be to leave her if that's what she really wants? It sure would save you a lot of trouble if you just got rid of her before she did it to you. At least you could go out on a good note and not be the one who gets dumped.And finally  how about Alice? Or Jane. Or whoever. If this movie was supposed to make me think chameleon or changeling  it didn't. It made me think that this is a highly commercialized movie that is trying to program the audience to believe that failure and deception is acceptable. This whole movie is an Aaron Spelling plot from 90210 because everyone sleeps with each other  hates each other  and despises themselves after all is said and done. I admit to reading a summary on IMDb half way through the movie that made me want to finish it. It said something along the lines of \""wait until you see the end; you'll never see that coming.\"" So I watched and watched and watched and when the credits rolled  I was still waiting for this magnificent ending. So what? So she goes back to New York  a failure from London who was a failure already from New York  grows long hair  looks a little prettier  maybe a little wiser  and walks down the street like a supermodel. I guess we're supposed to think she is like a well-weathered sage  a been-there-done-that kinda gal who is really self confident and has been hurt so-don't-mess-with-me-if-you're-gonna-play-mind-games. I mean  really.Overall  I gave this movie a 5 because of Clive Owen. He's fresh enough in the market so that you haven't (yet) seen this character and meaner than everyone else in a very subversive way that makes you hope you never meet someone like him. Other than that  you can skip the rest.\tThis one was of my favorite movies of 2004  and I felt compelled to write a review. First off  the acting is top notch by all the actors and normally I'm not a big Julia Roberts fan. This was one of the only movies I have seen her in where I didn't feel like I was watching Julia Roberts play herself. Jude Law  Natalie Portman and Clive Owen all are superb as well. The direction by Mike Nichols is awesome.I see a lot of people seem to think that the message of this movie is \""don't fall in love  you'll only get hurt\"" or calling the movie amoral. I think this movie actually has a very moral message. The message is that if you mistake lust or passion for love  you are going to have a really bad relationship. And that is a message this society needs to hear. The problem of falling in lust and thinking you are in love is rampant in our society. This movie is a warning about what can happen when you make that mistake.As for the people that have said that it never feels like any of the characters care for each other  and deem that as bad acting. Well guess what  none of the character care for each other. No one in the movie loves anyone else. The only person in this movie that probably even comes close to loving someone is Natalie Portman's character; I think she may actually have feelings other than lust for Jude Law's character. Everyone else in the movie is just lusting after their current partners.However  I will say this. Definitely not a movie I would bring my mother to see. There is no sex in the movie  just a lot of talk about it. Very graphic talk about it. If you can't handle graphic language  especially language using graphic sexual terms  then this is NOT the movie for you.\tI call it one of the worst movies ever because I expect more from a Hollywood movie with big stars. I don't go to see Chainsaw massacre expecting Shakespeare so when a movie this bad flies under the radar I feel it is my duty to warn people.This is one of those movies with no likable characters. I don't mean the characters are bad people  I'd have no problem with that  I often root for villains. I mean they are unlikable. All four of the characters in this movie are pathetic.They sleep with each other in Hollywood fashion  meaning relationships are never established. Falling in love takes place off-screen  though unannounced jumps in time  all we see is fighting.The lapses in logic are amazing  meaning these characters do not act like normal people  they act like Hollywood people. All of the situations the characters find themselves in are fantastical and not grounded in any kind of reality.I didn't watch the whole thing because there was a scene were the two males leads meet and one starts crying when in real life they would have beaten the crap out of each other.yeah this is one of those movies where the female lead can't decide with one of the men she loves and the two men are both too dumb to drop her like a sack of potatoes  go share a few beers at a bar and sleep with ANYONE ELSE. (See \""Jules and Jim\"") That wouldn't be so bad if the movie gave us any reason to like Julia Robert's character. I mean  some movies manage to make you believe that this woman could actually be worth all this trouble  but this is not one of those movies.Plus Portman is around to be the poor little girl neither guy really wants but who they both sleep with when they can't sleep with the other women. P.S. Portman is the only one doing any good acting.Please Heed my warning  I really wanted to destroy the copy of this movie that I rented  but I realized that there are lots of other copies out there and that destroying one copy wouldn't save anyone the horror of renting this movie.\tCloser explores the possibility of love at first sight.Closer is an exploration of Love and Lust between multiple partners.Closer examines the deception and betrayal of the ones we love.The story focuses on two couples brought together by strange quirks of fate. Alice (Natalie Portman) a young woman  innocent; vulnerable and outrageously sexy. Dan (Jude Law) a pretty unsuccessful writer  who is genuine  honest and faithful. Anna (Julia Roberts) is a photographer  she is decisive  intelligent and beautiful and finally Larry (Clive Owen) a doctor  brilliant and successful.Four different characters  none of which are quite what they seem  as their individual relationships grow  so do their inner most desires to get what they want.Wonderfully directed by Mike Nichols  and with truly outstanding performances from all of the cast  Closer is in a class with films like 'American Beauty'.Almost entirely character driven  Closer is not for the casual viewer  the story gradually moves along  unfolding the characters backgrounds and emotions  cleverly weaving in some twists and shocks.Compelling  uncompromising  sexy  dramatic and at times tragic. Closer successfully stirs your emotions and captivates your attention from start to finish.Probably the best film of 2004 10/10\tTo be frank  my friends and i are debating whether this was in fact the worst movie we have ever seen (though it is not much of a debate). We are asking anyone who was involved with this movie to please  give us our hour and a half back. There was nothing entertaining about this movie  other than a nearly nude Natalie Portman  and fellas  there is not nearly enough shown to justify spending any money to view this movie. The movie is only dialog  which is incredibly poor  and never even came close to being dramatic. Any attempt at a plot was simply shot down by a severe lack of realism  and conversations that went no where slowly. I give it a .10 out of ten  beating out League of Extraordinary Gentlemen for the coveted title of WORST MOVIE EVER!!\tI can't find anything wrong about this film. Because I'm not a Julia Roberts fan and usually don't go for the romantic-drama genre  I waited until the DVD release to view the film; I shouldn't have. Closer is wonderfully acted  employs dialog that rings true  and ultimately is able to achieve a powerful narrative rivaled by few other films to date. A masterpiece that will be studied and revered for decades to come. The picture  centrally  deals with the emotions inherent in the modern relationship: trust  betrayal  and vulnerability. Closer probably isn't a good date film  nor even a \""couples\"" film  it isn't bubbly. It is  however  the director Nichols' best work to date  which is saying something  remember he was responsible for The Graduate. This movie isn't as culturally significant as The Graduate  but I prefer it nonetheless  as it seems to reflect a more mature and honest view of human relations.And then there is the acting. Clive Owen deserved best actor  Portman gives another outstanding performance  and Jude Law shows  once again  why he's the new Johnny Depp (probably will never get the acclaim he deserves  like Depp  or Pitt for that matter  due to Hollywood hunk-marketing). By the end of the film  none of the characters walks away unblemished  and yet you empathize and identify with all of their faults  as if you can imagine yourself making similar mistakes. Nichols was wise enough to depict the youthful quartet as naive  stupid  cruel  narcissistic and selfish. I suspect this movie hits too close to the bone for some.I have to reiterate  this isn't a happy consumer-land film. This is serious cinema revealing the failings many of us are prone to make while young and searching. I'm glad Hollywood can still make a movie like this. Life isn't a beer commercial and not all of us want trite escapism all the time. Cinema  at its best as in Closer  is capable of achieving so much more. I appreciate a silly genre movie as well as the next person  but sometimes a person wants something with more substance  a film working on a different plane. A film like a good novel  teaching you a little more about yourself and your fellow man.Finally  I have to note the superb  and somewhat risky reliance the filmmakers made using Damien Rice's unforgettable song \""The Blower's Daughter\"" to set the tone for the film. The choice was shrewd giving the film a melancholy  but humane  quality of romance.\tI'm fully willing to admit that this is a really remarkable script. I'm also fully willing to admit that every actor in this film did an absolutely amazing job. I've always been a Clive Owen fan  but this is just above and beyond. Portman too. And Roberts. And Law. Ah  heck  everybody was great.However  didn't anybody think the ending was... well  bad? I was locked into the film for the entirety  right up until the slap. Then  for no reason  they put in a hokey slow-motion sequence. After that  I have no real complaints  except that the significance of Alice's (or rather  Jane's) fraudulent identity is not explored to the extent it should be.The stage play has an entire scene with Larry  Anna  and Dan in Postman's Park where they discover Alice's memorial and talk about why she might have made herself up. It provides much better closure to the viewer and there's no schmaltzy slow-motion. About the slow-motion: the slap is about the characters  not about the action itself. This is once again something that worked better in the stage play. No possibility of adding slow-mo to a play. It maintains a focus on the interaction between Dan and Alice and not on actions themselves. It's not the slap  it's the fact that he slapped her.I know  I know: you can't compare the stage to the screen  they're two different media. I know this already. All I'm saying is  they could have adapted it in a manner that retained at least some semblance of the retrospective atmosphere in the stage play. And the slow-mo slap? Talk about a complete mood-ruiner! Other than that  amazing movie.\tI couldn't agree more with all the people who hated this film. What a complete waste of time spent with 4 self-absorbed dull losers who have absolutely no basis in reality. Their actions and reactions are completely arbitrary  and the talk about sex is there only to make the script appear \""racy\"" because it does nothing for the plot or for character development. For all those people who think this is sparkling dialogue and a mature look at love and sex  then you need to advance beyond the maturity level of a 16 year old. These people fall in and out of love like pre-pubescents on sugar. There's no chemistry between any of them  and the writer seems to think that the world works on the basis that \""if I like her  therefore she likes me.\"" Comparing this to \""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\"" is like comparing my golf swing to Tiger's...\tOther reviewers here have given good evidence as to why this film is a failure  so I need not go on about it here. I would like to add however  that 'Closer' does show  without any sort of brilliance or depth  just what a bland bore Tony Blair's 'Cool Britannia' has become. Where boring people are content with being snotty and obnoxious and self-centered  and there's really no outstanding reason NOT to be. The emptiness is everywhere. And what are two American women doing in all of this? The story might as well be in Dacron  Ohio. London is as nothing. And Mike Nichols! Once a master director  now  his talents ebbing  attempting to make a hip picture with hipper stars  should have known better. This rubbish  from the man who brought you 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' and 'The Graduate'! Think about retirement  Mike. Every opportunity for making this story into something noteworthy was spitefully thrown away. At least the petulantly 'victorious' so-called dermatologist Clive Owen could have tossed in a scabies or eczema joke or something when he has just reduced delicate Jude Law to tears. And this  in the Land of Monty Python! It almost makes one pine for the Thatcherite days  when at least the Great British spirit of satire was alive and well. Now we have a sort of transatlantic blandness. Yak yak yak  blah blah blah. So I have to assume that the cast and crew thought they were making some sort of intellectual statement  either via a modern existentialism  or via a much baser technique: by bludgeoning the audience softly with just plain boring and uninteresting empty characters. If they wanted to dabble in this sort of water  they could have at least done a viewing of Peter Greenaway's masterpiece  'The Cook  The Thief  His Wife and Her Lover'. But boring is safer and does not require so much depth or imagination.\t#1 Pointless. There was no discernible plot. Wait actually there was  sort of: people having illicit affairs  and then ... and then I don't know. Basically this movie was 4 people having adulterous affairs. That's it  nothing else.#2 Acting blew.These are/were famous actors & actresses  right? Not Tuesday evening at the West Dinnerport Theater? I've acted better and with more emotion when I performed shadow puppetry in front of my dad's Chevy for a group of 6 year olds.#3 Incomprehensible motivations for the characters to do what they did.Lust? Hate?? Depression??? Come on  give me something!! To be fair  the last two were evoked by the movie  but were not to be found within it.All in all this movie was a fantastic waste of time. It did give me a low point to compare other movies to though... \""well  at least it is not as bad as 'Closer'\"".\tThis is a depressing story about four petty  unhappy  cruel people who are perfectly willing to lie  cheat  manipulate  and destroy each other to satisfy their obsession with each other. The show started out sweet and romantic  but that didn't last long. I found it very difficult to identify with any of the characters  because they seemed to develop an obsession with another person at the drop of a hat  before they even knew anything about the other person  and they seemed to fall in and out of love at a moment's notice without any real reason for it. I kept waiting for the movie to redeem itself  but it never did. I'm surprised at how bad it is  considering the great acting talent and the positive reviews from many critics. It was a disappointing waste of time.\tCloser is trying to say something profound  but who knows what. It's a case of style over substance - a \""much ado about nothing\"".An anti-feminist movie  with two thoroughly unlikeable men  one silly woman (Roberts)  and an OK  but naive(?) fourth (Portman). The women are just chess-pieces being played by the men  and seem quite content reacting to their manipulated status. No empowerment  insight or intelligence. Maybe this is real life  where women just cannot help themselves  poor things.Quite a tedious movie about a pointless subject  lots of talking about pointless subjects and debating about pointless subjects  meaningful looks  bed-hopping  lying  deceit. There is very little character sympathy developed - as each character is completely indulgent and fails to exercise restraint or discipline.This mediocre picture is not helped by gratuitous attempts to give the characters some vague backgrounds: Roberts is a (mediocre) photographer  who seems to live by the rule that a crap picture is better if its enlarged  Portman is a stripper (now that's worth the rental fee!) and Owen is a doctor of some sort. Most contrived  Law is an obituary writer. Maybe he could write an obituary about his nearly dead career  having been in turkey after turkey recently.On the plus side  it's good to see Julia Roberts in an understated \""Adult\"" role  and she shows that she can excel in a good dramatic role. Portman isn't too bad  and Jude Law and Clive Owen just go through the motions. Well  the male characters did OK  given the weakness in their scripts.\tI had a movie session with my girlfriend a while ago  and we happen to stumble upon this piece of movie. It was her choice  and I know that I hadn't picked it if I had to choose. :-) Anyhow  this movie starts out rather weird and it contains a lot of jumping in the chronology  which was quite easy to follow for me (even though I thought it was quite weird) but my girlfriend was facing a hard time at times trying to follow the jumping in the chronology. Natalie Portman makes an excellent performance here (as usual) and really blends this movie. The performances by Jude Law and Clive Owen are OK  but I think that Julia Roberts makes one of her less good performances here.The movie didn't really turn out to be an awful movie as I first expected by judging it from its first 30 minutes  and I have to admit that it settled a weird feeling in me that it was somehow OK  but I didn't really like it at all. The piece contains a few surprises for the analytic trying-to-predict freak  which were to my pleasure. But generally this weren't something I connected well with at all. 5/10  and those 5 points are just because of the neat acting here.\tAfter having read the gushing reviews below for \""Closer\""  I decided to shell out some cash to buy a DVD copy of it. Luckily the outlay was not very much  as I bought it whilst on holiday in Malaysia. However  from which ever way you look at it  it is either...A - sub standard Nic Roeg  strangers in a strange land coming together to explore their sexualities or B - it's a film about a stripper  where she does not actually get them off or if she does  Clive Owen's head gets in the way.Patrick Marber should stick to writing one liners for Steve Coogan  rather than come out with this pretentious dross. This film is not worth your money  let alone your precious time.\tI'd read only three positive reviews before I saw this movie and I still don't understand why people hated it.Okay the language is quite explicit and it may be shocking to hear it from actors we don't expect to be foul-mouthed in movies(I don't think anyone would have complained about the profanity if Joe Pesci had been in the film) but when you're dealing with such subjects as love sex and couples being destroyed and you really want to show their pain or as in the case of Clive Owen's character their determination to win the war sometimes colorful language is necessary.A part from that this movie is really heartbreaking as director Mike Nichols (an expert in odd relationship-dramas)and screenwriter Patrick Marber who also wrote the play this movie is based on narrate a \""war\"" between two couples who are determined to obtain what they want no matter what sacrifices might be necessary.Marber's dialogue is gripping and believable and it does actually provide some laughs (the highlight is the on line-sex between Jude Law and Clive Owen) although the movie is actually a great tragedy.The script is also complex as it moves from month to month and year to year and almost never fills the gaps(you have to listen to the characters in order to understand what happened).As for the actors Jude Law and Julia Roberts are very good but they're hugely overshadowed by Natalie Portman who is really impressive as a stripper who actually only wants to be loved and Clive Owen quite simply OUTSTANDING as merciless dermatologist Larry.Not even his portrayal of Dwight McCarthy (from Sin City) can match the energy passion and rage(or brutality)he displays in this incredibly compelling film strangely overlooked by some critics and by the Academy.This movie is one of the best of 2004 and also an excellent choice for those who don't like big-budget effects-heavy films.Not recommended if you believe in happy endings.\tWonderfully acted and intensely psychological  this is the type of film that is meant to be viewed more than once. The film proves to be the most realistic depiction of adult relationships that I have ever seen on the screen. There is no simple explanation for their problems and emotions  the characters and the plot are both extremely complex. Closer's presentation of realistic and highly conflicted characters reminds me a lot of those in Tennessee Williams's Streetcar Name Desire. If you are in the mood for a film that really makes you think and gives you something to reflect back on later then I would highly recommend this film to you.\tLets cut to the chase. Here is a movie about a bunch of characters that lack the ability to have a healthy relationship and seem perfectly happy to play partner swap between themselves. Hmmm.... how could a story so perfect for late night on cine-max be so royally ruined? Bad script  bad editing and bad acting.First warning any movie patron should note is that plays rarely translate into good movies. Face it  plays are filled with pompous preachy diatribes that stage actor seem to love and some people seem willing to watch. But I want a movie where the words from the character have meaning and seem real  here they are too often over extended speeches that push the realm of reality. In most any scene you start to wonder why one of the characters doesn't just walk away. You get the feeling they all just want to yammer on and on for the sake of hearing themselves whine and moan.Editing: I'm sorry but if you want to jump around in time  give me a clue that you are going forward three years or back one year or whatever. Don't make me listen so closely to what they are saying to figure it out. I don't have a copy of the playbill from the original play so I don't have the advantage of a written guide to what scene I'm watching.Acting: Okay  I can accept Clive Owens acting... Even Julia was acceptable.... BUT  Jude Law seemed to be do the same character he did in the last two movies he was in  only now he talk on and on about nothing. And lest I forget Portman  GOOD GOD was this a mistake. Yeah she seems believable for a while but when you get to the part of the movie where she goes back to being a stripper.... I'm sorry but if you want to play a stripper and be believable take your clothes off. I could only laugh as she is up their as a strip among other actors that are actually bare breasted and she is wearing more than you would see on a beach. If you take a job acting as a stripper get naked  otherwise you come across as a joke. You start thinking  \""Oh  she wanted to get away from being the nice queen of Star Wars... Ooops did she read that script the first time? guess not and so you no longer believe her portrayal...I could rant on but suffice it to say the movie sucked... maybe it was a good play  but as a movie it ain't even worth the time on cable.\tThis movie can be summed up in 1 one AMAZING. How can people ever doubt or criticise this movie. It was compelling and mature with a wicked sense of humour. Also who would of guessed the ending i wouldn't of Alice not being Alice AMAZING.Also this movie did star Jude Law  Who i cant stand. I still enjoyed seeing him act. this was a true triumph for him. But if don't like the sound of the story just go to see it for the beautiful actress Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman. Them alone would make any movie good.AMAZING\tAn intelligent and difficult film 'Closer' asks questions  and the audience chooses whether to investigate what is presented.There are no easy answers and none are offered.My guess is that most people would rather dismiss the film than dwell on the very uncomfortable issues presented; after all reflection is very hard work and we are mostly not used to it.Will total honesty always destroy relationshipsWill sexual jealousy always destroy relationshipsWhat stops us acting on our impulsive desires; is it our 'moral rectitude' or our fear of the consequencesHow can we live a compromise and still be true to ourselvesWhat would a win-win compromise look like in the context of a relationshipIf we have lied can we still trust that someone else is telling us the truthAre we stuck in a relationship because our fear of the unknown is greater than our present unhappinessHow great is our need for control in a relationship or do we need another to control usI noticed that it was the men who needed to know every detail of the so-called 'truth'. Maybe it is the case that women can live with a deal more uncertainty and compromise than men. It did seem that the two mens egos were more fragile and maybe this is generally the caseQuestions questions..Lots to think on and I am glad that I saw this film."""
Constantine (2005),"Chances are they are die-hard fans of the Hellblazer comics/graphic novels. Chances are you've never even heard of Hellblazer. Even less likely is the chance that you've ever even seen one and/or are familiar with the story and its main character  John Constantine.This is an entertaining movie. It's a very cool story done very well -- regardless of what Hellblazer fans say. I don't care if the movie is true to the comic and I don't care if Keanu Reeves plays the role of Constantine accurately -- and neither should you.Reeves isn't Russell Crowe or Geoffrey Rush. He doesn't have to be -- especially in a movie like this. Much like his work as Neo  he does enough with John Constantine to give the average movie-goer an enjoyable experience. This movie was a pleasant surprise and much better than I thought it would be -- considering the many critics. 8/10\tMuch like the halfbreeds of it's plot  Constantine treacherously treads a thin line between a divide. The film isn't dark or deep enough to be considered along the same lines as the likes of Batman Begins  and at the same time it's not camp or over the top enough to be considered a 'fun' comic book flick. This is one of the main pitfalls for the film  as with this strange placing of the film; it has cut out both of the comic book audiences  and left itself with a film that is as muddled as it's lead actor's acting is weak. The plot seems to jump from one happening to another  often without any kind of explanation or logic. This makes viewing this film a very turgid experience  and the fact that the plotting is so carelessly done has also left the movie a good twenty minutes overlong; which only serves in making the film more painful. It's a shame that this film isn't better  as it has a plot that could have lent itself to a very fun flick. The plot follows John Constantine; a man that can see the demons that live among us. When policewoman Angela Dodson's sister apparently commits suicide  the two team up and discover a conspiracy beneath the surface of their native Los Angeles.Keanu Reeves often gets criticised for his acting  and for good reason - he's rubbish. He slinks his way through the film  giving the very same nonchalant emotion to every scene and event that he comes across. The good thing is that a downtrodden character like John Constantine suits him  so it's not as bad as it could have been...but on the other hand  if a talented actor were given the role; the film would have been much better. Keanu's \Chain Reaction\"" co-star  Racheal Weisz joins him again here  and pretty much does the same thing that he does - i.e. just 'appear'. You don't go into a movie like this expecting good acting really; but this film doesn't have even have 'acting'! The only performance I really enjoyed was Peter Stormare in the role of Satan  and that only lasted about five minutes. The special effects are typically dazzling  and while it's not the best CGI of all time; it's imaginatively used and provides the movie with it's main asset. It's a shame that this film is a flop  as the film noir elements of the plot could really have delivered something interesting  the subject of devils and demons always makes for fun viewing; and the recent run of comic book films has been quite impressive...but impressive  this film is not  and on the whole I recommend giving it a miss.\tThis is a fable...it's not supposed to be so rooted in reality that we scoff at the implausibilities and the plot holes... We're not watching it to say \""look at how that happened\"" or \""why is it all happening here in L.A. when we have these worldwide problems\"" or...whatever... It has to happen somewhere; either you buy off on the fable and get into the story or you flush it...While not being Catholic  through theological edification I was able to make sense of storyline  ironies  metaphors  etc... I liked Reaves' character and again  it's a matter of preference - love or hate - but he played Constantine's miserable demon-cop just right - Reaves continues to find rolls suited to his particular  dark style. Special effects were great  and I give the film kudos for not diving in and becoming an effects extravaganza...it remains online to the story and where we're going... Weisz as heroine and Peter Stormare as Lucifer himself were well-cast. What can I say? It was great diversion and a fun DVD to watch. Check it out!\tThe Film Constantine  directed by Francis Lawrence  written by Kevin Brodbin and staring Keanu Reeves has only been out a short while and already has garnered enough acclaim to rank itself as a modern classic. The exciting  action loaded film follows the continuing saga of dark soul John Constantine  demon hunter. Punished by God to wonder the streets of Earth  for an attempted suicide  he now must 'earn' his way back into the grace of the almighty. To do this  he must hunt down and 'excorcise' every sort of demonic beast that plague's mankind. Aiding him are a host of penitent souls who have sinned and wish to redeem themselves. To make matters worse  is the Archangel Gabriel who want to step up the 'final' conflict and match powers with Lucifer (Peter Stormare) himself. Caught in-between their cosmic battle is Constantine  who must atone for his sin with self-sacrifice and brute power over the army of the dammed. Extremely good film and exciting from beginning to end. ***\tI really enjoyed this film. I liked the effects  the humor throughout the piece  the acting. I'm not a religious buff of the catholic faith  but I agree with another comment  and that is  that even though Constantine may not stay true to the faith and invented a few things- I liked the movie regardless...or maybe in spite of it. I also didn't feel that this film tried to beat me over the head with religion. Though  I liked the religious aspects...the demons  the idea of God  the depiction of the angel Gabriel (WOW)  the possessions; the exorcisms...the list goes on  were well done. And yes  the depiction of Hell too. Watch it; see for yourself. I know I was surprised  & pleasantly so. There was more action and goodies then I had originally thought  and I had seen and read of many! Enjoy!\tDimwitted supernatural thriller that is a major bore for the most part with a dimwitted performance by Keanu Reeves  who is miscast in the main role and a screenplay that is as stupid as it can be. A lot has been said about Rachel Weisz being the only good thing that this movie has to offer and I will agree with that assessment because she does make you care about what is going on with the movie while you are trying to figure out a way to care about the dumb story that is being told. Weisz's performance is much too rich and powerful for a movie like this and she gives you a reason to stick around while in essence there is no reason to even stay till the end. Hellboy was a masterpiece compared to this and that was marginal decent for what it was at the very best.For Weisz's rich and powerful performance  I give the movie two stars. If she were not in the movie  my rating would be in negative numbers. \u00960\tLots of fuss on this board about the movie  but in my opinion  good enough to plunk down 4 bucks and rent it for a night. Th highlight of the movie are the special effects  closely followed by the performance of one Rachel Wiesz. A truly captivating performance that had me moved. I can only imagine what it's like to lose a twin sister  but from my personal experiences  I can say that most of the twin talk in the movie is dead on. It helps that I have a couple friends who have either a spouse or siblings who are twins  but what do I know. Anyway the point is Weisz pulls it off effortlessly and should be considered one of the best performances of the year.Not much to say about the special effects except that they are first rate. With so much being done on a computer these days  it's not hard to tell the difference between whats real and a video game. (\""Chronicles of Riddick\"" comes to mind when I think of overdone computer-generated special effects.) So in a nutshell  the movie does not suck  is not great  and is somewhere in between. And yes  Keanu Reeves is not a great actor  not even a good actor  but I will still take time to check out his movies. Check out \""Something's Gotta Give --a much better movie-- if you want a good  clean  Keanu performance. As John Constantine he was good  in a dirty  life-sucks kind of way.Lower your expectations a bit and you may enjoy this little nugget of a movie.\tThis movie was very interesting I thought. The plot is very confusing but if you pay very close attention then you can understand it. Basically what this movie is about is Heaven and Hell. John Constantine had visions of demons as a child and soon tried to commit suicide  which is considered a mortal sin. However after the attempt doctors revived him. He was dead for 2 minutes and he spent those two minutes in Hell  and basically after seeing how horrible Hell was he never wanted to go back. So in a desperate attempt to buy his way into Heaven  he fights off the demons that are trying to cross over into the real world. The story tells us that there is a demon in every bad man and an angel in every good one. So when the demons attempt to come through  Constantine kills them off. But this still isn't good enough to get into Heaven. In the beginning an angel named Gabriel tells John that he can't buy his way into Heaven. John asks what he can do and Gabriel said self sacrifice. And then she tells him he's f***** which I found funny because she's an angel. But anyway...In the end just before the spawn of Satan is release  Constantine meets the devil. (Quick reminder that Hell wants him) The girl he's been with  Angela  has a sister who did the same thing that John did  committed suicide because of the visions she had. Constantine said that as long as she can go to Heaven instead of Hell  he'll go to Hell with him. However that is considered a self sacrifice and before the Devil can take him  He dies and goes to Heaven...briefly. Satan revives him  say that he's going to keep Constantine on the earth until he shows that he belongs in Hell. Cliffhanger  No? OK well I enjoyed this movie. There could have been more action but it actually was much more a suspenseful movie than it was action or horror. However if that is what Hell is really like I'm afraid to go there too. No folks this is no \""Little Nicky\"" Hell. This is a terrifying portrait of Hell. It creeped me out at least.CAST CONSTANTINE: The acting is okay. Keanu Reeves  although I honestly think he could use some acting lessons  is the perfect person to play the part of Constantine. He's not tormented by the things he sees  he almost sees them as playmates. Just more fun. And he does portray that well. 8/10 ANGELA: Rachel Weisz does an okay job in this movie. To be honest I appreciated her role in the mummy more than in Constantine. In the end she just had no effect on me. I wouldn't have care if she died. But she did an okay job in showing how much she cared for her sister  and how much she really wished she could have helped her. 5/10 CHAS: Shia LaBeouf is going to be a big star when he gets older. He becomes a bigger part of this movie towards the end and he didn't really have much to portray  but he plays his part perfectly. An eager kid wanting to be like John Constantine. \""If you're sitting on the bench you gotta be ready to play  right?\"" -Best quote in the movie. I was like \""YES! Shia's gonna play a bigger part.\"" 9/10 So all in all  good movie that could have used development around the plot points. 7.5/10\tIn the tradition of comic book-to-film translations  \""Constantine\"" (no  not THAT Constantine) offers very little in the way of plot and just focuses squarely on special effects and such. Also in line with such tradition  it all but completely discards the source material  which in this case are the DC/Vertigo \""Hellblazer\"" comics. Though I'm not big on the \""Hellblazer\"" series  which have seen their most popular arcs through comic book artist Garth Ennis  I do realize that much is different from the source material  including the fact that morose hard-a** anti-hero John Constantine is British and most of the action of the comics takes place in Liverpool  England.But I'm not here to make comparisons; I'm here to judge a movie. The best thing to be said about \""Constantine\"" is that it keeps you watching  not just for the effects and strong visual delight but because it's fantasy - interesting fantasy.In \""Constantine \"" we learn that John Constantine (the effectively wooden Keanu Reeves)  is dying of cancer  forbidden from entering Heaven as a result of an attempted suicide (he was clinically dead for two minutes)  has a bad attitude  and can see demons yet no one else can. To think that a normal person could see demons you'd have no choice but to declare that person insane  right? Demons and angels  we learn  cannot enter into the human plane of existence but strange occurrences in Los Angeles force Constantine to search for answers after he's attacked in public view by a demon.The plot to \""Constantine\"" bears more than a passing resemblance to a past Reeves vehicle (\""The Matrix \"" anyone?)  in that as human beings  we are completely oblivious to the truth about our reality. As the film opens  two scavengers in Mexico discover the Spear of Destiny  the weapon rumored to have been used to kill Jesus Christ during the Crucifixion.One of them high-tails it to Los Angeles where the main plot of the film is revealed. Isabel Dodson  the twin sister of Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz)  commits suicide. Angela  the dogged detective she is  disbelieves the official story because she knows her sister was a devout Catholic and would never commit suicide  as such an act would require eternal damnation in Hell.The special effects are nonstop  and there is one effective and horrific sequence where Constantine ventures to Hell  which is in all respects  a darker vision of Los Angeles except it's a place where demons and the damned roam. With the help of his legion of otherworldly allies  who include normal human Chas (Shia LaBeouf)  a half-breed named Midnite (Djimon Hounsou)  appropriately named Father Hennessey (Pruitt Taylor Vince) and the angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton)  Constantine and Angela race against time to stop a nefarious plot waged by the forces of Hell that could bring about the apocalypse.The plot  if you want to call it that  is pretty non-existent and Reeves is pretty wooden as usual but let's face it  nobody in this cast is going to get Oscars come next spring. The film drags for about the first 20 minutes or so but becomes more engaging as it goes through its motions. Director Francis Lawrence (of music video infamy  which accounts for the dizzying camera-work) does his best  but somehow or another the film can't really seem to get it together when it comes to certain parts of the script.For example  it's not really sure what it wants to be: a horror movie  fantasy  thriller  what? It's not really sure and I'm not really sure of what it wants to do. Such items shouldn't plague the viewer but it does  to me  play out a lot like a mish-mash of all three.As the anti-hero chain smoker John Constantine  Reeves' wooden acting is effective (is there any other way to play such a character?) and as the film progresses you can tell he's really suffering inside  as he grows sicker and sicker from cancer. And we also believe his desperation as he tries to send half-breeds to Hell in order to get back on God's good side so he can enter Heaven when he dies. In his character  we also get our fair share of Pentagrams and demonic spells and chanting and such. The opening sequence alone brings back uncomfortable memories of \""The Exorcist\"" (1973).\""Constantine\"" may win over die-hards of the \""Hellblazer\"" and people may or may not get a kick out of Peter Stormare as an Armani-wearing Satan. Like Neo says  \""Whoa.\""6/10\tThe trailer for CONSTANTINE made it looking vaguely intriguing: majestic wingspan lifting above Gabriel's head  murky derring-do in the streets of Los Angeles  the presence of Tilda Swinton (always involved - until now - in interesting dramatic films)  Rachel Weisz  Djimon Hounsou  and yes  Keanu Reeves. So what happened? Director Francis Lawrence should stick to his prior experience with making music videos. After the first few minutes of this tired and monotonous script (deliver in tired monotonous bland monotone by Reeves) you know you should just switch it off. But then come monsters emerging from the neck of a young girl undergoing exorcism  silly discovery of a lost spear by a border-crossing Mexican peasant in front of whom all animal life dies  suicides  'up pops a new monster' episodes etc etc. The apparent struggle between good and evil forces seems it may have been the impetus for this overblown mess  but others have done it better - many  many  many times ad infinitum. When will the public's tolerance (? demand) for this genre be exhausted? Grady Harp\tHey it's just another movie and it wasn't too bad really. Thought it would be a suck fest since Keanu really isn't right for the part  but hey  it's based on a comic book  so in a funny way  he fits the part. And yes I have read the comics. Shia does his part of the wanna be well. Rachel does a great job too. But you have to remember it is a comic book turned into a movie. The effects are great and there are a few parts that blew us away. The first part when the guy gets hit by the car is especially well done! I think the effects add so much more to the movie and make it worth the rental price even if you don't like the movie itself.I say watch it and form your own opinion ;)\tThis movie was so Awesome. I enjoyed myself throughout the whole movie. It was intense and was suspense and it was not predictable like some movies are. It kind of reminded me of \""The Excorcist\"" but a hundred times better. Like the underworld where he had to put his feet in the bucket of water to get to the place of fire and evil Now that is what i thought was cool. How anyone could of been bored during this movie i don't know  I guess they must be insane just kidding everyone LOLZ!!!. But I LOVED IT!!!! I could watch it over and over and over. It didn't just make me suspenseful it also made me sad like when John Constatine's partner dies i thought that was sad I could of cried but it was not sad enough to cry but it was sad. I give you double thumbs up.\tConstantine (Reeves) committed suicide (Catholics go direct to Hell when this happens) when he was a boy and was brought back in a deal with Heaven to send demons who have crossed the line (to our world) back to Hell. By doing this he is trying to work his way back on the path to Heaven. Why he was brought back is not known but he has the ear of both Heaven (Gabriel) and Hell. Now  too many demons are crossing over and Constantine believes the Devil is up to something not agreed to with God.The title of this could have been The Spear of Destiny as some believe that Christ died when he was speared by the Roman soldier. Whoever holds this spear controls the world. The spear was lost  of course  and found for this movie. It's impact was short lived and it's easier to name a sequel Constantine 2  rather than the Spear of Destiny 2. You may remember Constantine  but not the short lived spear that really didn't have the impact I thought this story would give it. This story was too much concerned with sending demons back to Hell. I think the sequel will have more to do with the Spear of Destiny. I can't wait. Can you? If the sound on my DVD version was any better I might have enjoyed this more. Sometimes it was very difficult to make out what a character said. You would think that a little rewind to go over the audio again and again would have helped  but it didn't' the countless times I rewound. Those who watched this in a movie theater really must have gone crazy with \""what did he say?\"" But  I got the idea and that is enough  I suppose. Maybe I just had a bad DVD. Maybe.However  everything was good  the acting was good  the cinematography was outstanding and a few demons startled me when I least expected it. Those I heard clearly wouldn't you know. The story got more complicated when Lucifer arrives on the scene near the end  almost like it was another story entirely and I got lost for a moment (sound  remember?) or two  but I got the idea  I think  maybe. Now  if I told you why he appeared that would not be any fun.But  all in all  not bad. Not scary  and the suspense was not really there for a suspense movie. Is it just me or is Keanu Reeves getting better? He did a really good job. But  no \""whoa.\"" I missed that.\tThis was a beautiful movie. Keanu Reeves (in all his magnificent glory) played the role of Constantine perfectly  keeping me rapt whilst watching. Rachel Weisz was good in her roles as Angela and Isabel Dodson. Shia LaBeouf was fairly annoying  and his character wasn't very good (Chaz Kramer) but he was bearable  and made the movie slightly funnier in some ways.The CGI effects in the movie are great  contrary to popular opinion  and I think that hell looked particularly realistic.I loved this movie  and gave it a 9 out of 10  ESPECIALLY because Keanu did such a good job in the leading role.\tit was an OK film i suppose but after reading a lot of good reviews i was looking forward to an early blockbuster hit. i was wrong. OK admittedly the special effects were quite impressive for a february release and the acting from rachel weisz was very good. keanu reeves on the other hand was awful. does he just act off of a teleprompter? it may as well be like he's reading a book or off a piece of paper. he is a diabolical actor and doesn't deserve the high standard of actor. he is worse than his sidekick chas in the film. chas (real name Shila laBoef) was quite good as a sidekick. he was a good entertaining character. but john constantine was dull and dreary. very borin. I've seen laBoef in a few other films such as I  Robot (bit part) and Holes. (i think that was him). and he really showed potential in I  Robot to be the next smooth talking actor on the big screen. like Colin Farell cos he sounds like he is confident and he is realistic with the way he acts. this boy has a great deal of potential and talent. he shud go far. but the film is entertaining in parts like the computer effects and the bath scene but everything else went out the window. literally. there was many plot holes. very much disappointing but it is worth the watch if ur into the Gothic tales of hell and the devil. 6 out of ten for the graphics\tReleased on DVD this past week  Constantine is the story of modern day exorcist John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) who teams up with local cop Angela Dodson (Rachael Weisz) to investigate the suicide of Dodson's twin sister. They end up uncovering the dark plans of hell's minions to take over the planet  unleashing a violent apocalypse. Despite his careless attitude  Constantine is forced to help in earth's darkest hour.This kind of role for Keanu just does not work for me. Sure  we're used to seeing him strut around in black trench coats with that dazed and confused look on his face  but in a time where planet earth is set to be destroyed  I sure hope we could find a better savior than Keanu. The acting award for this film definitely goes to Weisz  despite looking nothing like a cop (especially from New York City).The producers obviously use the great special effects to cover up the sub-par acting and pitiful story. There is nothing worse to me as a movie lover than to see a comic book film fail to seem anything like a comic strip  which Marvel has been so successful in doing the past few years (With exception of Fantastic Four and The Hulk). This is more like Gothic time for all of the pale and anorexic \""outcasts\"" who await their dark lord (Geeeeeez  someone give those people a hug or something).\tThis movie was an interesting  well directed and well written. Even Keanu beefed up his acting for it  showing the occasional scowl. Rachel Weiz opted to ditch her British accent for an American one  which can be a big mistake sometimes  but she did it flawlessly. This movie asks the age old question of  who would win in a fight  heaven or hell? Throughout the movie  Keanu Reeves' character battles demons and so forth with the greatest of ease  while the director takes the audience through an amazing adventure of direction excellence. I would recommend this movie to people who liked the idea behind the movie Dogma and the film-type of Stigmata.\tIt's with a certain glee that I am submitting my opinion on this \""movie\"". Once in a while comes a movie that is so atrociously bad that it becomes fun to hate. CONSTANTINE is one of these movies. It's easily (too easily) the worst movie of 2005  but it's also a strong contender for the worst movie of the last 5 years. Before you dismiss me as a Keanu Reeves hater  know that I love (and own on DVD) the full Matrix trilogy (yes  even Revolutions) and My Own Private Idaho  definitely his best role to date. I'm also a big horror movie fan. So all in all I was really excited when I went to see that film. The trailer was awesome  I couldn't wait! The film starts well  I mean the first 5 to 10 minutes. It's all downhill from there  culminating in the most unexciting climax of all time  with Peter Stormare as the most ridiculous and non-threatening Satan ever. Keanu Reeves kind of proves his naysayers right by offering one of his most awful and wooden performances ever  on a par with his \""work\"" in Brad Stoker's Dracula  but worse  as in that movie he didn't have such a long time on screen. Here  he's there constantly  non-playing. Ewww. Rachel Weisz is good (as always)  but not enough to save the film. I lost any interest whatsoever after half an hour  and the only reason I didn't leave the theater was that I didn't want to be rude to my mate  who I had dragged to see this. I thought maybe he was enjoying it. However  when the stupid and absolutely unexciting climax happened  I turned to him and asked \""Are you enjoying this?\"" He replied \""Are you kidding??\"" \""Should we leave then?\"" did I ask... \""It's almost over  we might as well stay\"". Well we shouldn't have. The ending was as bad as the rest of the movie. Oh  for those of you who think \""it might not be fantastic  but I'll watch it for the special effects\""... a word of warning: the CGI looks like a cheap video game  absolutely not realistic. Rent it if you must  but don't make a blind buy  you will regret it bitterly!\tI enjoyed the movie and thought Keanu Reeves (Constantine) played his part well. Peter Stormare (Satan) was exceptional in his portrayal of the dark side and Tilda Swinton's (Gabriel) performance as God's angel of destruction was well played. The script was well thought out and if the viewer has at least a basic knowledge of the 'end times' they will be able to follow the plot and appreciate the strong performances of the actors.Before watching the movie  all the reviews I read were bad. I'm pleased to say that they were all wrong! I hope they intend to make a sequel! After watching this movie I went out and bought my own copy!\tI had no idea that this was based on a comic until I actually started watching the DVD. Loved the effects. Scene where the Mexican guy finds the Spear of Destiny  changes (becomes possessed) and gets hit by the car - Priceless. Scene with the possessed girl...thought was good. Scene where Constantine goes to hell to see if Angela's twin was there...he finds her and catches the hospital band - Priceless. Loved the make up of the demons - thought that was very original. Scene were Constantine leaves the gas station and is confronted by a demon (..of bugs) - Priceless. Scene where the guy (forgot his name - he was a priest) goes to the morgue and finds Isabel's body  freaks out and tries to quench his need for liquid but can't...priceless. I then said to myself  'break the bottle' ...no luck... priceless. Scene where the the priest dies in the store...one of the half breed's watches his death - the store clerk who was bent down over him...the wings... Loved the wingsI am the biggest horror fan of demons  vampires  etc. and the biggest critic of anything that's supposed to be scary  I was definitely entertained to the fullest. I watched it twice already.All in all  I thought it was a good take on heaven and hell and all the actors did a great job."""
Crash (I) (2004),"The summary should do  really. But let's elaborate a little. Before I say anything else  I'll tell you I'm a critical movie watcher. I'm European  prefer European movies as they have far more depth and diversity and I have little respect for the rubbish shoveled out of Hollywood. But I still keep an eye on it. Even among the trash you can find things worth keeping  and this movie definitely qualifies.The story is sobering  at least at first. It doesn't hold it's punches when the human condition (at least in L.A.) is described  and it shows us racism is rampant everywhere. Yes  even in the USA. The quality of this movie lies is the complexity of the emotion that is shown - events and characters are not black and white  if you pardon the pun. Characters are far more rounded that we are used to seeing in Hollywood movies. Still  Crash doesn't manage to keep it's strong points going for the entire duration of the movie. Sentimentalism creeps in  some events you can see from a mile away and the obligatory 'happy' ending cannot be avoided (I don't think you'd consider it a spoiler if I tell you most characters in the movie have received a lesson in life by the end). But what we see in between opening and closing credits is strong enough to make not want to dwell on that too much - it's also strong enough for me not to be naive and think the lessons learned will stick  not with most of them anyway.All in all  it's a rare thing to see a movie of this quality  with this cast  come out of the Hollywood studio's. You wouldn't want to miss that  would you?\tOne thing's for sure - this is not of the calibre of an Anderson or Altman  despite the director's obvious frames of reference. The plot development was telegraphed for all to see  and the rather cynical attempts at wringing the emotions while tying up the loose ends of the various strands made it feel like a daytime soap (written by someone who feels he should be doing something more 'worthy'). Every character seems to have reached an epiphany by the final reel  despite the wildly variant moralities on display. Maybe this is the most interesting aspect of the film  but sometimes it is better to make a stance and take a view rather than let it blow in the wind as this director seems to prefer. Although one may read the premise of 'Crash' as being relating to racism (in all it's forms)  in the end the ambiguity on offer lets it down badly and 'soft-soaps' the issues - when a more confrontational view may be more useful and relevant in highlighting the world we all live in.\tI agree with what so many others have said about the shallow and offensive nature of this film's examination of racism. It is baffling to me that so many people seem to have been fooled by its pretentiousness. I want to comment on the Matt Dillon character as an example of what's most infuriating about this movie. Here we have a man who -- contrasted with the film's underlying message that \we're all a LITTLE racist\"" -- effectively rapes a woman in public  cruelly humiliating her husband and deliberately goading him to make a move that  as he well knows  will lead to his arrest or even death. He does all this after pulling the couple over without any legal cause but because  as we come to understand  they are black and wealthy and he is a hurt little boy who is now the police and can therefore do as he pleases. This behavior is not a LITTLE racist. This behavior is evil. It is disturbing to me that this extreme of racism is held up next to another character's behavior -- spouting her paranoid stereotypes about gang violence -- to illustrate that everybody's a LITTLE racist. Later  we're spoon-fed some tripe about Dillon's poor old dad and how black folks drove him into the poor house. Is this supposed to explain  or worse  excuse this behavior? And is Dillon's character meant to redeem himself by committing the utterly unmotivated and unbelievable  laughably coincidental act of saving the woman he sexually assaulted the very night before? Please. The fact that so many people seem to feel some kind of self-congratulatory admiration for this film makes me feel sad about the shallowness of our understanding of racism  and our apparent lack of commitment to condemning and ending it.\tIn 1991  filmmaker Lawrence Kasdan created GRAND CANYON  a follow up to his hit THE BIG CHILL  focusing on the lives of individuals from different classes in the great melting pot known as Los Angeles. Fourteen years later  Academy Award-winning writer Paul Haggis boosts the tempo on Kasdan's formula with CRASH. Instead of looking at classes  Haggis focuses on race relations and proves that not only does everyone in LA hate everyone else  they downright despise each other.No one is safe in Haggis' hands  which beautifully amplifies the awareness all Los Angelinos must feel  as his cast of characters include questioning Anglos  surviving African-Americans  angry Persians  working Latinos and the downright criminal Korean. Much like in a Robert Altman film  this cast all interacts with each other in unsuspecting cyclical ways. The two misunderstood African-Americans who hate to be profiled end up car-jacking the very- whitebread DA and his wife. The white rookie cop has to deal with his racist partner and his callous captain. A Mexican locksmith becomes a scapegoat for a Persian shopkeeper. An African-American detective is in love with his South American partner. All these roles are admirable played by an exceptional ensemble cast  many of whom are not known for serious \u0096 or good - drama work.The story focuses on events that try the souls of mankind: carjacking  fender-benders  break-ins  shootings  racial profiling; events that make citizens feel hurt  afraid and  most of all  angry. It is anger that Haggis shows so well and the emotion is cast from the screen like a betrayed friend. Haggis also substantiates that no one in the overpopulated metropolis of his film interacts or understands their neighbor  and that this lack of touch is a direct result of their own anger and fear \u0096 and it doesn't take Yoda to point that aspect out. Don Cheadle's character  Det. Waters  so eloquently points out in the scene-setting opening moments  \""In LA  nobody touches you. I think we miss that touch so much  that we crash into each other  just so we can feel something.\"" Haggis takes the next hundred odd minutes proving his thesis statement on anger and fear in a dramatically beautiful way. He then surprisingly does something else: he shows that love still exists in the City of Angels.\tI was floored by this film  having seen it without having heard of it before. Like other reviewers here  I noticed the similarity to Magnolia  but since that is possibly my favourite film of all time  I am unlikely to see that as a negative! I was amazed that it was a directorial debut.What impressed me initially was the acting. The smallest exchanges were given a gravitas that I find too often missing from 'drama' movies  where only the 'Oscar moments' are performed and filmed with such visible care. It seemed to me like a series of vignettes  that even on their own  outside of the greater context of the film  felt important and special  and carried messages. I thought Chris Bridges (Ludicris) was great  and both Don Cheadle and Matt Dillon turned in complex and brave performances.Any film that makes me laugh aloud and burst into tears is powerful to me  because I think it's really hard for a film-maker to do both convincingly. Some of the dialogues were sharply witty  and yet didn't come off as smug. The emotional high points weren't forced or clich\u00e9d (well  with the possible exception of the little girl : 'I will protect you Daddy' - but who cares  I was bawling at that point anyway!)  and when it was done  I was left feeling incredibly moved by some of the most powerful scenes.I do think the film will receive some criticism for what will be perceived as overt 'worthiness' or politically correctness  and I can see why in a sense  because there is just a hint of white middle class guilt edging in. However  I really couldn't see how this could have been done with a lighter touch  without losing the significance. To me it was about compromise more than just racism or corruption  how we all get chipped away at every day  and at some point we have to take responsibility for it  and change it or let it go on. There was redemption  but at a price  and even the ending  which had the teensiest whiff of cheese about it  left me smiling :) Oh  great soundtrack too.\tand the only time they come into contact is by crash'. And with these words Paul Haggis tears open the box of CRASH  one of the most searingly vital and important films of the year. This is a film that explores prejudice  racism  fear  hate  bigotry  random violence and all of those barriers we people of the cities have erected to isolate ourselves from the miscegenated world in which we live. In Haggis' hands every possible form of miscommunication based on ignorance and transference of self-loathing is woven together in a story that mixes Caucasian  African American  Asia  Persian  Hispanic conflicts and lifestyles and the concurrent disruption of world views gone wrong into a pungent story of tragedy and collision.Every character in this well-crafted script eventually confronts every other character in ways that are at times coincidental  at times  tangential  and at other times the direct result of prior confrontations. African Americans bully each other over their own prejudices  Caucasians belittle their Hispanic workers and are the first to point the finger at the 'tattooed gangsters' who in reality are innocent tradesmen  Persians terrorized on their property immediately aim their hate at other minority suspects  redneck racist policemen thrash out at African Americans in response to their own personal family demons that have eroded their outlook and extend that venom to the most innocent of the rookie cops who metamorphose into like habits. Every form of prejudice and hate is encountered and none of the characters is free from being both the perpetrator and the victim. It is as though the Golden Rule of 'Do unto others as you would have others do unto you' has been hideously transformed into a reason for violence.Each member of this extraordinary ensemble acting team is outstanding form those with the largest parts to those whose presence is fleetingly meaningful. And some of the actors heretofore know as B actors rise to the level of brilliance under Haggis' knowing direction. Matt Dillon  Ryan Phillippe  Don Cheadle  Terrence Howard (here is a star!)  Thandie Newton  Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges  Larenz Tate  Loretta Devine (extraordinary!)  Beverly Todd  Jennifer Esposito  Michael Pena (who delivers the most affecting scene in the film)  Shaun Toub  Yomi Perry  Brendan Frasier  Sandra Bullock  Tony Danza  William Fichtner - indeed  the list of the entire cast should be included in the kudos.People leave the theater stunned  tearful  informed  and incredulous  so great is the impact of this film. Much or that impact is aided by the brilliantly creative cinematography of James Muro and Dana Gonzales and by the powerful musical score by Mark Isham. This is quite simply one of the finest films of the year by anyone's standards. For those critics who descry Haggis' lack of providing 'Redemption' for the characters  this viewer would take offense: every character is altered either tangentially  directly  or referentially by the tightly woven tapestry that is CRASH. Recommended for everyone to see  internalize  and begin to make changes on our planet. Grady Harp\tI saw this film over two months ago and it's still going through my mind. The main character is the Los Angeles I live in- most of us isolated in our cars as we travel though our daily lives on congested freeways and streets  inching slowly towards our destinations. Only when forced by the usual violent circumstances do we rub up against our varied ethnic communities only to realize how different we all are- and yet  as this film reveals  how similar our humanity is.Crash is a great ensemble film  drawing together actors that give both subtle and dramatic life to their characters. Sandra Bullock for once reveals a dramatic edge to her acting ability  and Don Cheadle as always  shows his talent a hundred percent. The rest of the cast stands out in their ability to give this film not only the different contrasts between the characters  but also the thin gray lines that blur stereotypes. Paul Haggis shows us how fear keeps us isolated  and yet how once in a while when it is called for our humanity brings us together to show how much we all share in common.This film is helped out by outstanding camera work and a soundtrack that adds greatly to the emotions revealed in it. Although I have mixed feelings about recommending any movie (everybody has their own different opinions when it comes to watching a film) this is one film I feel moved to talking about to friends. When award time comes around I feel this one should be on the list for consideration.\tThere are so many important issues surrounding this movie  but for one is the importance of social well being and understanding. Never before has a movie so greatly pointed out the reasons for racial discrimination  not just White people being small minded  but ALL aspects of racism.The movie follows several different stories/characters  who all meet up at some point. Their stories however  all surround their discontent for other races  whether it be Asian  white  black or South American. Cop  D.A.  housewife  car jacker  liquor store owner. It seems that all aspects have been covered. Not to forget the unmissable drama that unfolds as a consequence of each others actions.Make of this what you will  but I implore you.........do everything you can to watch this movie. My personal opinion is that is should be shown in every single classroom around the world. ******OUTSTANDING PIECE OF CINEMATIC REFERENCE**********\tBefore seeing this film  I really didn't know what to expect. I had never seen a clip or anything of that nature to hint to some sort of plot sequence or the like. A friend's nomination was the only driving force that i had to see this film. Upon the final credits scroll I found myself in a cornucopia of emotions  relentless in the mere fact that such a great film had gone unnoticed. I honestly wanted to clap after seeing what had gone on and how everything came together. There are one or two shortcomings in this film however  but I will leave you to decide if my interpretation of that is truly what it is. I don't want to mention what takes place in the film so as not to give away any plot elements but trust me  this is not a film that should be missed. This has gone  in my mind  from relative obscurity to my top 10 of all time list. Id say right under \""The Last Samurai\"". 1) A Beautiful Mind 2) The Last Samurai 3) Crash 4) American History X 5) The Matrix 6) ConstantineCheck out these Films\tI went into the movie with high expectations given its IMDb rating. However  the movie seemed to be satisfied skipping along the surface of its theme of racism without ever exploring it. It simply demonstrated a sequence of contrived events putting racist characters face to face with other racist characters. It did that masterfully  but there was no coherent message in it all. Some characters undergo VERY cheesy epiphanies  the rest though stay pretty much exactly the same. Sandra Bullock's role in the movie was so pathetically one-dimensional it's a wonder it wasn't cut. Don Cheadle's role was pretty much entirely irrelevant...he contributed nothing to the movie except a sad-looking  pensive face the entire time.\tWhen you bake a cake  you put all the ingredients into a mixing bowl  mix them all together  and then bake it. If you just have the ingredients and never actually mix them together before baking though  you're not getting a cake. 'Crash'  to me  feels like just that; great ingredients  but nobody mixed the batter.'Crash' has all the elements of a great movie. Great cast  great acting  great dialogue  believable characters and motivations  impressive cinematography  and a good director. But it just didn't quite 'gel' with me. It seemed like it was just a series of vignettes with barely developed characters and story lines  with a bunch of racist overtones to speak a message that's never quite clear.Most of the characters were stereotypes themselves  nobody *really* redeemed themselves even though the stories made it seem like many of them did  there was never any closure in the majority of the stories  and everything was just a bit too coincidental to seem as realistic as the movie was supposed to be. All of the characters would show up again to affect another character in the story  which would then affect another character. For a movie that's supposed to portray gritty realism  I certainly found myself thinking \""What an unlikely coincidence\"" very often whenever a character would show up again later on for a dramatic third-act plot twist.I think a TV series with maybe one character's back story focused on per episode (for example  the same format as ABC's \""Lost\"") would've worked better. But there really was never a full  coherent story in this movie  nor was there ever a clear message. It just seemed like they wanted to pack way too much into two hours  and for me  it fell a little flat.Definitely worth seeing for the fantastic performances (I never knew 'Ludacris' could act  Don Cheadle is excellent  and even Ryan Phillipe surprised me). But to me  it's a movie with a near-perfect body  but no real soul.\tNot only is it well done with great acting performances and great directing  but it's just an amazing \""put it all out there\"" type film. An incredible movie that is just so important in today's society. Not only should every American see it  but I'm of the persuasion that it should be shown in high school \""decision making \"" \""critical thinking\"" or some sort of HS level psychology classes.When I told him that it will change how you look at society forever  a friend of mine asked me \""What could a movie teach me that I don't already know?\"" I realized then that while there was so many answers  I couldn't just tell him one. I realized he needed to see it for himself.Simply put  it is THE most important movie for our American culture of the past decade.\tI saw the film yesterday night and I can't stop thinking about it. It is not a film to escape the reality for two hours  on the contrary this is a film which follows you in the real life. The characters are good chosen  almost each nationality living in Los Angeles is represented. It shows us how our prejudices are affecting us in our lives and doings  and how we judge our fellow men with our stereotyped ideas. The characters in the film confront their own prejudices and show us that inside of all of us lays a good one and a bad one  that we \""learn\"" our prejudices and that there is always a possibility to change our way of thinking and our lives. It was frightening to see about the Verisimilitude of the film and how little we trust each other. I can just recommend to see this film and remember that we all are foreigner at almost every point of this world.\tA horribly disturbing piece of work with great actors looking great doing great work. I felt manipulated  but the actors all hit their marks with precision. Just when the character would be fully developed in other movies  an underlying attribute or personality trait or quirk of fate would just shake this movies world up a bit. A nice change of pace from the regular cookie cutter movie  but then again maybe not. Maybe this movie was just cut from a bigger broader cookie cutter. Certainly within the confines of THIS movie the same cookie cutter was used to display the quirks and variables of life that are often not seen or attempted to be shown in other movies.\tThis isn't going to be a review as such  rather just my feelings towards this film. This will probably help no one  but I feel I have to say something so I can move on to other  better films.I can't deny that this movie is well made. It looks good  its well acted (even if Sandra Bullock is too much of a personality and stands out too much)  and its one of the rare Hollywood movies out today that has a point of view. But for all the pluses I can't say I like the film or even admire it on anything other than a technical level. I don't like being preached to. I don't like how it feels so carefully constructed and artfully put together that it seems more like a sermon rather than a movie. Sure its premise  simply put  that racism affects us all  and that some can over come it is true  but by the end of the movie I was left feeling unmoved and asking the screen \""yes  and?\"" The film seems to be trying to take a high ground and say that it knows better than all of us. Somehow I don't think so.This movie made me feel the same way that a play called Spinning into Butter made me feel. Spinning into Butter is by Rebecca Gilman and is in the process of being made into a movie. The play deals with racism on a small New England college campus. The center piece of the play is what is essentially a 20 minute monologue that boils racism down so narrowly that it ends up says that if you don't sit next to a person of a different race on a train/subway car  even if its completely empty except for the two of you then you are a racist. Many in the audience were moved by this. And equal number of the audience were left shaking our heads in disbelief since the play essentially says all acts are racial acts. I left the play  as I left the theater showing this movie admiring that they got so much right  but feeling that at the point at which they got on the soap box they lost me and I was never able to fully accept their premise.As well made and on target as the film is  its derailed by the film makers need to climb onto that soap box. I'm left not wanting to ponder the points out for myself  rather I want desperately to ask them \""yes  and your point was what?\"". Actually my feeling is more a happiness that now that I've seen it  I never have to see it again.\t(watched in Toronto)Paul Haggie's (writer of \""Million Dollar Baby\"") directing debut  \""Crash\"" is an attempt to be a thought-provoking film about racism. Despite a good cast and good efforts  it succeeds only in showing what racism looks like  but has no in-depth probing into what it really is  not even to the level of the legendary Archie Bunker TV series in the 70s  \""All in the family\""  let alone the all time classic \""Guess who is coming to dinner\"". (1967)Quite a few critics condemn the plot for its total lack of common sense credulity \u2013 in a city of multi-million population  L.A.  the two dozen characters keep bumping into one another as if this were a small rural town. Personally  I do not mind the coincidence  serendipity and all that  looking from the angle of these contrivances being necessary theatrical manipulations to get the ensemble story constructed.Really lacking is the superficial treatment of the characters  as well as inconsistencies. Haggie wants to show two sides of every human being and there's nothing wrong with that. But take an example in Matt Dillion's character  a racist cop who thinks that Blacks are the cause of everything bad. So far so good. But if you look at his upbringing and if what he says about his father is true  it is totally inconceivable that he would turn out to be the way he is.The movie is well intentioned  well acted and has some positive messages. Beyond that  however  it does not have much more to offer and is generally overrated.Finally  just a quick summary of the various interwoven plot lines  using the names of the actors  rather than the characters  for expediency.1. District attorney Brendan Fraser and wife Sandra Bullock got their car taken form them at gunpoint by two Blacks Ludicrous and Larenz Tate. Bullock's innate prejudice and distrust of minorities is later softened when after slipping and falling down the stairs  she finds that the only help comes from the Latina maid.2. In danger of being compromised  Fraser forces police officer Don Cheadle to shield him  using as a threat the latter's delinquent brother Ludicrous. Jennifer Esposito is Cheadle's partner at work as well as lover but he never bother to understand her origin  considering \""Mexican\"" (which really has nothing to do with her) to be sufficient.3. Locksmith Michael Pena  after fixing the locks for Bullock's house and earning suspicious glances from her  goes on to work on Iranian Shaun Toub's store. When the store is broken into  not because of the lock be because of the door itself  Toub wants blood and would have killed Rena's 5-year-old daughter had it not been for a lucky mistake in buying the wrong ammunition.4. Affluent Black couple Terrance Dashon Howard and Thandie Newton encounters racist cop Matt Dillon who molests Newton in a body search at a routine drink-driving check. The couple's relationship stands a severe test as a result of this ordeal. Later  by sheer coincidence  Dillon courageously rescues Newton in an accident when she is trapped in her car that is about to explode.5. Young cop Ryan Phillippe  Dillon's partner at the same search  cannot stand his bigotry and asks for a new partner. Later  Phillippe courageously diffuses a situation in which innocent Howard is in danger of being shot by police officers. But ironically  Phillippe later picks up hitchhiking Ludicrous and shoots him dead in a misunderstanding.6. A Korean couple is placed at various junctures  more as Asian tokenism.That covers most  but not all  of the interwoven plot and characters.\tI was rather surprised about the plots of this movie. All I knew about it was what I have seen watching the trailer. Nevertheless we went to see it since the alternatives were rather weak. I was a bit disappointed in the beginning when everything seemed to be about racism and characters whos actions I could not understand. I thought heh whats the big point? So that dude is black and that chick is white.. Come on guys  get along. Don't be such clich\u00e9s.But as the movie went on and I stopped wondering how it is possible that a bunch of people keeps on meeting each other again and again in such a big city as Los Angeles and realized that the movie is something like an oversubscribed analogy and that it really doesn't matter if the happenings are plausible  I started to compare that film to \""American Beauty\"" in my mind. I guess it was necessary to show development in characters that in reality probably would take years. After that I was very happy we went to see that movie. The message(s) of this film should be pretty obvious  so nothing to say about that.Personally I really liked Matt Dillon's acting and finally I saw Sandra Bullock in a role that I liked. But the rest of the actors performed very well also. Don Cheadle rules.Altogether  a film very worth watching. I'm not from America  but maybe it is even more worth watching if you are. Who knows.\tYes this is a good film but at the same time paints a rather basic picture  it contains just about every race that would live in Los Angeles  black  white  Chinese  Hispanic and Arabic(portrayed as Persian in this film) and states basically that they all hate each other. The redemption of the film is that it is saved by a few great scenes involving Matt Dillon an Thandie Newton and the Persian guy and the Hispanic Guy(if you've seen the film you'll know who i mean)  these scenes alone drag this film up above ordinary and make it worth seeing.The one thing that does slightly annoy me with this is that it so obviously owes a lot to magnolia whi9ch is a much better ensemble piece than this is and yet receives a lot less recognition  if you enjoy this then you'll be blown away by the sheer power of magnolia  which by the way Tom Cruise deserved some kind of award for!To summarise  while this is undoubtedly a good film  it is inferior to other ensemble pieces (Magnolia Boogie Nights and Pulp Fiction to name a few) this is still a worthy watch  but having seen Magnolia can only leave a sour taste in your mouth for the under appreciation that film received compared to this.7/10\tFirst of all  if this is an accurate depiction of life in LA  the movie compellingly makes me glad I don't live there! Fantastic directing  acting  writing  film editing  and storytelling! Don Cheadle is really becoming an acting juggernaut! One of Bullock's better jobs of acting too. The tension in quite a few scenes is nearly unbearable. A few flaws detracted from the over all experience for me  however. The opening premise does not seem to ring true. Although LA is different from some other big cities  in that direct contact between people is much more limited  the net effect in terms of hostility and crime is not all that different than New York or Chicago. The problem is more with big cities in general than with LA air conditioning and cars in particular. The other problem was with the Persian storeowner's irrational treatment of the Latino locksmith. He seems to speak English well enough in all the other scenes to be able to understand what the locksmith is telling him  but he acts as if he doesn't know the difference between a broken lock and a broken door. He showed no appreciation for the work the locksmith did at no charge. I also don't know what he expected to get from holding up the locksmith later  unless he though he was responsible for the robbery of his store. None of this was made very clear  although this storyline's crucial scene itself was an absolute corker  no doubt! A must see for 2005!\tClunky  predictable  but politically correct. Matt Dillion saved it from really stinking.The multistory line flavor of current film (Go! and Pulp Fiction) makes the movie-making so tangibly present that getting into the movie is difficult. Only Pulp Fiction has succeeded in the form because it was meant to be like a comic book. It is very difficult to get lost in a film that keeps reminding you that it is a film with slow-mo digital and constant cute cuts.Dillion's character was well played. One could understand his multidimensional character. The others characters seemed contrived in revealing their many sides. I found the movie to be one where it's fun to talk about how you enjoyed it  but actually enjoying it? That's another question entirely."""
Creep (I) (2004),"This low budget British horror flick pretty much flew straight under the radar upon release towards the end of 2004  and while the film doesn't deserve the status of a classic  or even a modern genre classic; Creep still offers a good  horrific eighty minutes and fans of classically plotted horror thrillers will no doubt enjoy themselves. The film is very thin on plot  and works just from a premise - the premise being that Franke Potente has found herself trapped in the subway after hours. This wouldn't be so bad  but she's got a strange mutant on her tail that seems to delight in murdering everyone around her! While this plot doesn't really allow the audience to engage with it due to the fact that it is so shallow  director Christopher Smith keeps the film ticking over with an onslaught of suspense and tension brought about by the claustrophobic landscape of the tunnels underneath London and the fairly generous helping of disgusting gore effects  which are a nice addition to any horror movie if you ask me. If the film has any sort of commentary on the state of the management of London's subways  it's muddled at best\u0085but it doesn't matter  as nobody sees this sort of thing for social comments anyway.The effects of the 'creep' itself are actually quite good. The monster is mutated enough to be visibly inhuman  but it retains enough of it's human form to be recognisably humane in some way. The creature effects in this film seem to have been a big influence on fellow recent Brit horror 'The Descent'  as the monsters in that film very much resembles the one in this. Franke Potente knows a lot about running since her big hit was the highly acclaimed German drama 'Run Lola Run'  and she gets to stretch her legs in this film more than just a bit too. The frantic pace of the film really makes it what it is  and while there's nothing in this film that you haven't seen before; the movie takes it's borrowed elements and moulds them together into a slick horror cocktail. The fact that it's only on for eighty minutes will ensure that you wont get bored in spite of it's thin premise  and if a short running time isn't good enough for you; the gritty gore certainly will be  as this film features lots of grappling  stabbing  gutting and many other such things. It would seem that the director has an eye for visuals too  as he presents a few of them - the best being the bloodied hand reaching up from under a train!\t...then look somewhere else! I saw this film during the Fantasia film festival  the largest genre film festival in North America. I was looking forward to this movie considering it starred Franka Potente and it was made in the UK  far from the Hollywood schlock. Given the premise -- young woman stuck on the underground after hours with a killer on the loose -- I expected something like a modern-day cross between Alien and Deathline. Unfortunately  the numerous gaps in logic and character development completely ruined the film to the point where I actually hoped *all* the characters would die in the most gruesome and creative way possible. To be fair  there are 2 scenes I enjoyed: the mock surgery performed by the Creep  and the final scene when Kate 'replaces' Mandy on the platform. Other than that  the characters' behaviour is completely contrived and forced  the plot is full of holes large and small  and the tension is defused by entirely predictable scenes  which is a capital crime for a horror movie.In short  the modern update to Deathline still remains to be made...\tI had very high hopes for this film. And as the summary says  it wasn't bad  but it wasn't the best.The main problem was it appears to have been cut too much  making it look like the film didn't know whether it wanted to be teen slasher or psychological horror. It had a couple of truly disturbing bits but also several  \oh look  we blew the budget on fake blood\"" moments.All in all I'm glad I saw it  but I'm also glad I borrowed my mate's DVD and didn't go to the pictures to see it and therefore waste a fiver. Worth a watch if you're a horror fan though.Kim xxx\tI was so disgusted by this film  I felt obligated to warn off others. This film has no story  plot or hint of purpose. The film starts after the standard \""lets be scary\"" movie intro  which by now every film watcher has become accustomed. So we can ignore the beginning completely. We are soon introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to all that you have just wasted your hard earned and would be better off watching static. (Unless you have seen white noise - EEK) Acting is a DISGRACE and all of them should return to the travelling pantomime from where they came. Having said that  even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this film remotely watch able. Their poor performances merely contribute to the disaster. Senseless violence and what I can only assume is the written word of yet another junked up \""eccentric\"" writer  who probably considers himself to be an artist  has resulted in a film which will test your patience. It was not until my fellow watcher turned to me and said  \""We have been watching this for 45 mins\"" did I realise that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag. Clearly something was missing and unfortunately it wasn't the audience. Rather than suggest what the film is missing  let me tell you what it has: Dumb Blonde (surprise surprise)  Victims  bad-monster-guy-thing  about 2 mins of storyline which is stretched over hours  days  weeks  months... and credits.Want a silver lining? Well  the blonde girl is a bit saucy looking in some of the scenes  but expect to want to see her face ripped off for the rest of the film!\tCreep is a rather gory horror movie which makes a movie like The Amityville Horror look like a Disney-cartoon. Movies like this usually end up in a straight-to-DVD release because of that. But it has some visual style  waste little frames (it is at least short) and has some reasonable storytelling: The way Kate misses the last train  how she discovers the whole world behind the tube  the way Craig is introduced.The horror scenes are made with remarkable little visualization or sound effects but rather with direct action. A knife is planted  somebody gets an operation and we see just (some of) that. It seems to say to the horror public that if you want to see some horrific actions  we will show you some as a punishment for your curiosity. (Take a look at Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar's horror movie Tesis  much better than this  by the way).The movie uses the claustrophobic setting inherent to the tube to set some atmosphere but when larger spaces are present long-distant shots are used. (It even makes fun of these shots when the night porter says he can't see a thing because of the long-distant shot of his camera  and then he gets killed).Creep also contains many references to other movies. The nail-scene refers to Se7en  The Scottish junks from Trainspotting  Craig looks like an ugly and mean Gollum from The Lord of the Rings  Franka Potente from Lola rennt / Run Lola Run does a lot of running  etc.There are many plot holes in the story and it is also rather unbelievable that her friend Guy wants to rape her. And the story could do with some more twists. But wait: The dog comes out remarkable clean  and the two guys on the platform in the last scene are not shown. Could they have been the two male characters ending up dead in her dream?\tBefore getting hold of this film  I read some of the reviews about it on the Internet Movie Database. I was especially keen to see it because of the fact that it was British. There are so few British films being made these days that I just had to see it.With a score of about 5 out of 10  it was clear to me that this film was not going to be as good as I had thought it would be initially.I think the opening scenes introduced us to the characters and their circumstances quite well. The central character is Kate. She goes to Charing Cross to catch the last train  but falls asleep on the platform and misses it. She wakes up in the empty underground - alone. She walks up to the station entrance  hoping to get home using another method of transport in the early hours of the morning. Unfortunately  the station is completely locked up and she cannot get out.Suddenly  she hears a train coming and runs down the stairs and gets onto it. The fact that this train is completely empty doesn't deter her! As she steps on  we see a quick blur as someone else leaps onto it as well.The train comes to a sudden stop in the tunnel and the lights go out. Kate hears some noises and goes to investigate. A mysterious figure  who turns out to be someone from Kate's past - Guy - attempts to rape the girl. As he attacks her  the train doors are ripped open and Guy is dragged underneath the train and attacked himself.For the rest of the film  the monster thing is after Kate. The people she meets along the way are all slaughtered by the monster.Like with all films  Kate defeats the monster and lives to tell her tale. She stumbles out of the underground and onto the platform  covered in black muck and holding her dead homeless friend's dog. As she sits there  relieved  the platform starts to fill up with early morning commuters. But although she is happy  she becomes startled as she looks towards to the tracks...I'm guessing there is going to be a follow-up to this film.What disappointed me about this film is the fact that the only underground station they used was used too much. It would have been great if they would have used a second or third as Kate searched for a way out of the underground.\tI used to travel on London's tube a lot. I always found it a comfortable place. Warm  mostly clean and a labyrinth of echos. To some it is a scary place  especially after the rush hours and the late night clubbers. The Underground system has a lot of potential for a movie maker with imagination. Unfortunately this director has none. Sure he tries  and his elicit grab is not to be blamed. For we all use our experience of movies gone bye. But shame. The victim woman had two chances to kill the 'monster.' and did not. I laughed. And that is the worst condemnation you can give a horror film. All that money wasted. The opening with Ken Cambell and the black actor  who is unbelievable in all the roles he plays. He acts. He is never a person. The structure with regard to setting up later scenes is thought through. The main actress does her job. In fact that is the word I've been looking for - job. This is just a job  with no insight  no imagination  and no love for the art. Horror at it's lowest level  the Northen line would have a problem with this one. Refer to 'Mind the gap!' Crap.\tCreep doesn't do what its title suggests  it isn't exactly creepy  but it is pretty violent and gruesome. The story is fairly linear and has no plot holes that i noticed and the acting and script are OK.The problem with Creep is that it doesn't really do anything to set it apart from the rest of the Horror crowd  but when compared to some its not to bad.With floods of horror movies in recent years (Toolbox Murders  Grudge  White Noise  Descent  Boogeyman to name but a few) Creep is left languishing in mediorcratity.For horror fanatics  its worth watching and it can hold its own in the genre. For movie lovers in general there is not enough here to warrant your time.6/10\tBeing a fan of Franka Potente after first watching her in Lola Rennt  I was looking forward to seeing Creep  hoping for a good scare and a great performance. Unfortunately this film provided neither.Although I can appreciate horror even when it follows the classic scare pattern  if that is done correctly it works after all  in this case everything was so dreadfully predictable that it only resulted in a couple of disappointed sighs.Franka Potente's talent clearly doesn't work when there's no logic to the script. Her performance was dull and frequently unconvincing. It's not that she doesn't know what to do with a horror movie  as her acting in Anatomie was good as always.This film makes me appreciate a movie like the Ring even more: the way the director succeeds in creating scares at often unexpected moments and the fact that the scary part is not so much bloody creeps as fantastic tension throughout the movie that has more to do with your own imagination taking over.* spoilers * Way too much of this film had no logic at all. I'm not talking about the fact that she runs through dark tunnels alone or other recognizable horror stuff  but about more profound things. When she arrives in the subway for instance  she falls asleep - necessary because she has to get stuck there after all - but it's completely nonsensical in the sense that she is all wound up before. Falling asleep therefore is a film-necessity but very unbelievable.Later on  she wants her co-prisoner to swim underneath cages  while she herself can do it a lot better (she is closer). But  she has to ask; after all  we already know the guy cannot swim  so we have to go through this motion first.She seriously injures the creep  but fails to kill him at three opportunities. When a horror flick is made well  that might work  but here it just makes you edgy watching (\""just kill him  girl and get it over with\"").I could say a lot more  but really  what's the use. * End of Spoilers *I wouldn't advise anyone to see this movie. Even if you travel by subway  it's really not worth your time.\tI was expecting something a bit more sophisticated than this American style \""horror\"".I'm usually a scared person (heck  I was even scared by Scream!) and love to be scared  but the villain was so poorly unbelievable  I just got bored and wanted it to end. I think they wanted it to be like Jeepers Creepers  with bizarre freaky killer  but I would have been happier if it was a mad homeless person  rather than the freak of nature  so unbelievable  it just didn't work.I was hoping for me to be so scared   that I would have been scared to go on the tubes for a while  but sadly no. This horror freak was not impressed.Nice idea for a film  just a shame they spoilt it.\tI find it disappointing that there is no 0 on the 1-10 scale.This is the worst movie i have seen.Not only is it gory beyond belief  but has no story line and leaves you with many questions that would have put the movie together.The beginning with the opening credits and the girl supposedly being chased through a hall  with blood all over her was disturbing and unrelated-unless she was Mindy.Then there was this other person on the bus who i at first thought to be the creep but wasn't and you never saw him again.(the guy i'm referring to is the one that had blood all over his eye.)the creep was weird  i had no clue what it was supposed to be  maybe a dead guy or something  but he looked more like a creature..and he could talk  which confused me a bit.Now i am only 12 turning 13 years old  so maybe this movie was more disturbing to me then the other commenters.I enjoy watching a good horror movie to get a good scare  but this movie wasn't really scary just disgusting and filled with gore and had no story line.\tThis is the worst horror movie of all time. We weren't introduced to any characters so whether or not they died was pretty irrelevant to the story and quite frankly i couldn't care less. I wouldn't want to get to know the characters anyway because the acting was so poor I'd rather puke in my hands and rub it in my face than meet the cast.As for Craig (aka Rumple Stiltskin  is the worst outlined murderer that has ever been in ANY film. And I've not seen all the films but I'll take my hat off to anyone who comes up with something worse.I've made my point  I want 81 minutes of my life back.Seth\tAsbsolutley awful film. Starts well  beautifully shot and lit  but as for acting  plot  storyline-forget it. Most disturbing and offencive of all is the use of needless scenes of sexual violence against women. The attempted rape scene is not intrinsic to the tiny smattering of plot that exists  nor is the gruesome  wantonly graphic and offencive scene with the young lass in the stirrups necessary. When watching this film  one came away with the distinct feeling that some misogynistic and juvenile idiot had written and produced the film: such was the complete needlessness of the sexual violence within the movie. If the aim was to alienate the female side of the audience  then congratulations  it was achieved. There is a definite sense in which this film preys upon the innate fears of women  and for no good reason other than to sensationalise a film which could not be saved even by a plot transplant. If you are a woman reading this review  vote with your feet and do not sully yourself with this drivel.\tLoosley based on the same story as the film Deathline made in the 70's. At least the original didn't take itself seriously and had a humorous touch. This is a typical female-in-danger film but with no redeeming features. It just plays to the lowest common denominator. Nothing is explained. It just seems to be an excuse to show more gore without any reason. My teenage kids liked it  which is probably who it's aimed at.I've tried to think of anything that saves the film but so far nothing comes to mind. The characters are cardboard and you really don't care for them.Mindless  derivative nonsense.\tYou don't get too many decent British attempts at horror. This one falls into the category of 'better than average'. It is good entertainment but by the same token is by no means a classic.The plot is simple and the film introduces some entertaining and amusing characters. The main problem with this film for me was the lead character - Kate. Supposedly a German living in London her accent seems so strengthen and weaken constantly and her entire persona is deeply irritating.Normally these types of film involve trying to get the audience to sympathise with the lead character(s) who are trying to escape - however  in 'Creep' I found Kate so deeply annoying that I was almost rooting for the 'Creep' to kill her in an extremely painful fashion.\tI am a big horror movie fan and took a risk with this shabby looking British attempt of a horror (we should stick to our brit gangster films). Anyway  I wouldn't want to put anyone through this  the main role  was it Kate? was terrible  very poor acting and and a very annoying accent. For a start if she didn't want to go with that bloke at the start  she should have said no  but even when she was stuck in the blacked out train with him  she still was playing like a slut.(annoying) Lack of attention to detail was also particularly awful like with the surgery and the strange (not scary) skinny little weirdo roaming round the London underground  Why cage people up and then poke them with a stick? Just not scary I'm sorry. Poor acting  Poor story  poor characters  poor evil thing  all round poor!! didn't even want to give it 1/10By the way people if you do happen to fall asleep in the tube  just go back to sleep until it opens  not worth the hassle for about 7 hours obviously!\tAnymore lumps of sewage like this bob up to the surface of British movie-making  and there won't BE a British movie-making industry left.I had really high hopes for this: fantastic leading lady (Potente has previously proved to be chameleon-like) and superb basic premise (trapped in the London Underground after hours with something creepy). What I got was a film that asked me to suspend disbelief too many times  a plot with more holes than Ms. Potente's panty hose  and at least one set piece which served absolutely no purpose other than to shove the entire audience across that fine line between nasty suspenseful horror and pointless  sick shock tactics (ooo yeah  let's have the 'creature' shove a huge serrated blade inside a captive woman's genitals...). Potente is no stranger to bloody horror (Anatomie  Anatomie 2) but here she is simply required to run around screaming whilst occasionally delivering lines of total banality.A criminally wasted opportunity all round  and Smith should be actively prevented from making any more films (guys just don't give him the money!) until he's learned how to a) write an intelligent script that makes sense  and b) understands how to create scenes with REAL tension. AVOID!\twell.....it tried to be a social commentary at some points  but fails  its written so badly that I almost wanted to kill myself  the acting is terrible at best and the plot has so many holes that it might just be possible that there are more holes than plot.The lead is a pathetic mess  an arrogant high class wannabe who conveniantly gets drunk and falls asleep in an underground station...You begin to wonder why these places employ guards.Where there should be horror there is a massive cringe factor. Where there should be genuine emotion there's a telephone call for acting classes and where there's a play button on your DVD remote  there is also an eject button. save yourself the trouble of asking yourself \""why? how? Did someone actually think this was going to work?\"" and just take the disc out  return it  get your money back  and buy Monsters Inc  because that is 100 times more believable than this contrived mess.\tThis movie is burned down by the critics. I did not read a single positive one. I was lucky to see the movie on a festival  before the major release  before the critics could pie over it. The movie deserves better. THe story is told in numerous comments. Its all about being locked up alone in an subway and encounter your worst nightmare. The film does its Job. Believe me  I do not feel the same anymore in subway stations. The Creep character  which is more or less introduced in the second part of the movie  is not psychologically worked out. You do not get to know his motives in any way. Besides thats it is a creep and 100% mean and evil. This is one of major arguments of the critics. I would like to say that it does not matter what his motives are. This movie will scare the living daylights out of you. That's what counts. This movie is not for the faint of hart-ed!\tStarted with humour and suspense and I was all psyched up for a brilliantly gory/suspense film. However what exactly was the plot????? I am sorry if I seem a bit dense but 3 of us watched the film and non of us actually understood the whole reason for the existence of this movie. It was portrayed as gory but the worst part to me was the torn finger nail. I really enjoy a good horror film but I was left at the end totally perplexed. I hate these pretentious attempts that actually don't have a story line to them but are a pet project of a wanna be director/producer. In future guys get an actual plot before trying to con the public out of their hard earned cash to watch a pile of garbage."""
Dark Water (2005),"What distinguishes Dark Water from so many of its current Hollywood contemporaries is the shunning of special effects in favour of acting. An old fashioned notion  but one that pays off since you really get into the characters in the film and care about what happens about them. The performances are uniformly excellent  from Pete Pothelswaite's seedy janitor to Jennifer Connelly's lead role. The tension builds up slowly and there are deft touches  such as the lawyer's pretence of a family while watching a movie alone. I just wish there were more films like this these days. It is so tempting for a director to use CGI effects to conjure up scary moments  when this film proves that what is needed is a good script and fine performances.\t\Dark Waters\"" was disappointing to say the least. Ten minutes into the movie I figured out where Natasha was and what was going to happen. The only \""scary\"" thing about this movie was the horrible apartment complex the protagonists moved into  not because it was spooky  but because it was dark  depressing  ugly  dirty  and dismal. Hollywood can't seem to make a good scary movie any more. And the ending line was comical and several of us in the theatre actually laughed at the ludicrous statement made by Jennifer Connelly's character (I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen the movie yet by explaining the last scene).Speaking of Hollywood  what is it with the cookie-cutter movies? It's always the same: ghost of a child talks/threatens the living child/family in the story and the adults walk around not knowing what is going on until the end when the body or the truth is found out. At the top of my head  I can think of 9 movies with this premise that have come out in the last few years: Sixth Sense (best one)  The Ring 1 (very good)  The Ring 2 (worst movie of the year)  Stir of Echoes  The Grudge  Godsend  Hide and Seek  Darkness  and now Dark Waters.Isn't there any originality in Hollywood any more?\tDark Water is the story of a woman and her daughter moving into a new apartment. The apartment just might be haunted or the eerie things could be the result of the mother's disintegrating sanity.What really annoys me is that people keep saying: It's just like \""The Ring\"". Please realize  just like the commercials say: They were written by the SAME guy!!!!!!!!!! Dark Water  however  is more drama than mystery and the only thing they have in common is the dead girl living in the water tower. She does NOT crawl out of anything and she looks normal.The cinematography was great. It was a beautiful movie. The acting was great. I won't be surprised if this movie merits an Oscar nomination. I hope it does. Don't go in expecting anything scary. Expect a sad  drama about a mother struggling to keep her daughter.\twhen I saw the ads for this film my thoughts were along the lines of \""jesus Christ  stop with the Japanese horror remakes\"". As someone who watched ring before any of this palava kicked up whereby now creepy white kids are a staple part of any horror film I am sick to the teeth of them.Prior to seeing this I had just seen the descent  a superb British horror film  and somewhat had my faith restored in the genre. The really clincher was the fact that Waler Salles directed this and I really enjoyed the motorcycle diaries. I believe that you can see his touch throughout the film and are probably more likely to enjoy this if you've seen his previous work because you know what your getting.This is a classy drama film with tints of horror laden through it. Every time Connelly looks into the mirror (and believe me she does it a lot) your waiting for the creature to appear behind her. You are constantly waiting for that jump. The air of tension is maintained well and I the ghost itself is of a relationship between a mother and a daughter and that is essentially what this film is about. I was disappointed to see so many negative comments about this film because I actually believe its the fault of the marketing campaign that people will be let down. As a 20 something male I know nothing about the relationship between mother and daughter yet I really felt for the characters (the cast give beautiful performances a beauty mirrored in its direction) and it was handled delicately and thoughtfully. Not only this but it never gave in to the audience expectation of seeing that ghostly little kid or at least not in the way you expect it.A beautiful drama about motherhood  if thats what you want to see  see this.\tI have a somewhat different take from Mr. Ferguson's. I think it deserves a solid \""B\"" grade  for Good. Not Excellent  but not lousy  either. The performances by Jennifer Connelly  John C. Riley  Tim Roth and Pete Postlethwaite were  as mentioned  excellent  as you'd expect from such fine actors. What Mr. Salles does is to present us  through those wonderful actors  ordinary people in the kind of jaw grinding realities we all (most of us  anyway) have been through  and  in the midst of that to gradually bring in the Disturbing. He doesn't smash us over the head with it\u0097no fiendishly grinning heads turning 360 degrees accompanied by choirs of howling demons. No. Dark water and creepy whispers  and a hint of past foul play of the type we know means ghosts may lurk here.I think it is precisely because of the equality with which Salles presents both the everyday and the creepy that the creepy is given a kind of credibility different from the usual kind in horror flicks. In an Exorcist type movie  for example (to continue the comparison)  when the ordinary ends and the Spooky starts we voluntarily suspend skepticism so that we can be supremely weirded out by the special effects. We don't have to voluntarily do anything here. There's no stepping out of the Ordinary into the Supernatural. By the ongoing merging of the ordinary and the creepy  we are lured into accepting the creepy\u0085as it creeps in  as it were. By the insistence of Mr. Salles that we continue to empathize with Ms. Connelly's character by the everyday nature of the ongoing story  tension-filled as it is  throughout the movie  we then have to accept all that she experiences  as it is woven in at a level pretty commensurate with her real-life experiences\u0085but then ratcheted up at key points. Of course  there's the brief reference to childhood abuses to cast just a bit of question as to whether what we are seeing is the product of an imbalanced mind. But even that plays out both at the level of the conflict-ridden divorce she's in (he would bring that up  wouldn't he) as well as the supernatural invasion she's experiencing. Again  the merging of the ordinary and the creepy.I just saw it with my 15 year old daughter. We both enjoyed it  and agreed it deserved a B. We didn't walk out of the theater ready to phone friends and relatives to urge them to see it. But we liked it.\tDon't be fooled: you're not going to go see a horror movie. You're going to immerse yourself into a strange  morbid atmosphere that will carry you through an intimate  beautifully filmed story where it's the atmosphere and the characters that count. Yes  there's a few horror elements  but they are a subtle  underlying subplot that does not interfere with the delicate  smooth direction of Walter Salles. Nothing in this film is meant to scare you  but rather to leave a sense of discomfort after you've seen it. A sense of paranoia  like the main character's. And Jennifer Connelly is absolutely fantastic here. Much stronger than the original: here  the characters are real  and Salles connect us to their turmoil right away. Reminiscent of a Henry James novel  where fear builds up in the background as you share more and more of the main character's feeling. In a word: sophisticated. Different. The only similar experiment of this kind of subtle fear  injected in your imagination as you watch the film  is an Italian short I saw at last year's Frighfest  entitled \""Xchange\"". While you wait to be scared on screen  the story almost subliminally built horror in the audience's mind. A must see.\tDark Water may not be the new Rosemary's Baby - it's not quite subtle enough for that - but it proves itself a solid suspense-film nonetheless. In a time when movie-makers seem more intent on shaking us up than actually involving us in a story  this film comes as something of a revelation - a horror movie where the tension builds gradually  where human interest takes precedence over cheap shock-effects. The recent horror-excursion Saw seems cheesy and amateurish by comparison to Dark Water with its brooding intensity  its emotional texture. A movie like Saw is all about playing to the tastes of morbid adolescents  the kind of people who still think Marilyn Manson is cool. A movie like Dark Water provides a somewhat more sophisticated  though still readily accessible  brand of chills.Like Rosemary's Baby the film is all about a threatening environment. Dahlia  who has recently separated from her husband  moves with her young daughter Ceci into a rent-controlled housing complex on Roosevelt Island  NY.  a run-down tenement with a sleazy landlord  a grouchy super and a few dark secrets. Dahlia and Ceci are barely settled-in before they start experiencing signs of a haunted-movie-setting: strange noises from the room upstairs  bad dreams  a nasty water-stain spreading through the ceiling - all things that can be rationally accounted-for  of course  except that Dahlia suspects something more sinister than noisy neighbors or bad plumbing. The problem is that Dahlia herself is not exactly the picture of mental stability. She has lots of issues left over from her rotten childhood; she's unsettled after the separation from her husband; she suffers migraines - in short  the apparent supernatural manifestations could all be in her head. Like Rosemary's Baby the film teases us with the possibility that the heroine is simply delusional  that the strange goings-on are part of some paranoid fantasy. The difference is in the subtlety of the effect. In Rosemary  Roman Polanski achieved an unnerving atmosphere through purely cinematic means; in Dark Water  director Walter Salles employs more explicit imagery in helping generate a feeling of fear. Dark Water is less-accomplished than Rosemary cinematically  is more conventional in its effect  but it's still a worthy successor to Polanski's classic. It's genuinely involving  and like Rosemary it revolves around a brilliant  complex performance.That performance is turned-in by Jennifer Connelly  one of the most riveting actors on the planet. Like Naomi Watts in The Ring  Connelly provides acting chops and understated sex appeal  and an uncanny ability to pull one deeper into the story. The mystery-plot of The Ring depended entirely upon Watts's ability to sell it  and the suspense-plot of Dark Water depends equally upon Connelly's. This is a juicy part for any actress  a troubled woman attempting to protect her child from some unknown threat  and Connelly just kills it dead. Her dark hair and haunting eyes fit perfectly with the film's brooding aesthetic  but what she brings in pure emotional focus is even more valuable. What Connelly possesses is an almost freakish talent for conveying psychic turmoil  the sense of a character being eaten alive by inner-demons. She showed this ability first in Requiem for a Dream  then in House of Sand and Fog as a lonely  troubled outcast  and in Dark Water she outdoes herself. Her Dahlia is a horror-movie heroine for all-times  right up there with Farrow's Rosemary - a character so fully-realized  so memorable that it transcends its origins. The best parts of Dark Water are those when suspense-mechanics and horror-imagery become irrelevant  and what we're left with is the story of a woman's psychological disintegration. If the film overall fails to quite rise to its star's level  it's only because the plotting is a little too routine and the tone at times too insistent. It could've stood to be a little more subtle  and take better advantage of Connelly  but even as it is  Dark Water is a superior suspense exercise.\tI couldn't stand the movie. It was a complete waste of my money. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. I went and saw the movie with some of my friends and none of us liked it. It was a complete waste of my time. You sit there and figure out the plot right away. It is very predictable and it wasn't even scary. The ending was horrible. You would think that it would at least have a good ending but it didn't. Lets just say that I don't plan on adding this movie to my collection. Again...don't recommend it to anyone unless you have like 10 bucks and about 2 hours you want to waste at you local movie theater. I don't think it should be worth anyones time. There are plenty of other great movies out there. You would be better off going and seeing a movie like \""Fantastic Four\"" or \""War of the Worlds\"". At least those movies aren't boring and have some good scenes in them. Don't go see the movie. It is a waste.\tIf you feel there's something innately frightening about a child who wants to be cared for  this film will set you shrieking like the giddy  \""omigod omigod\"" teenaged girls who sat a few rows behind me in the theater. No doubt fans of The Ring  these girls probably coughed up the nine-buck ticket price expecting to be treated to the spectacle of another Samara slithering across the screen  dark matted locks obscuring her corpse-pale face.Natasha  the sinister presence of Dark Water  fairly withers in comparison to her fellow wraith. Though she suffered a similar untimely death (drowning in a water tower as opposed to a well)  Natasha sports neither creepy coif nor decaying dermis. In fact  she resembles most closely not Samara  but Ceci  the living and breathing daughter of Dahlia  9F's new tenant. So when Natasha fixes her gaze on Dahlia and utters \""Don't leave me \"" the effect is heartbreaking rather than shriek-worthy  I'm afraid.The film's climax  in which Natasha holds a struggling Ceci under the bubbly water of her tub  is indeed disturbing  but for the wrong reason. The director clearly intended an epic clash between innocence and unbridled evil  but due to Natasha's lack of a ghostly demeanor  what we see is entirely different--not a demon but a normal little girl harming another little girl. Needless to say  such a scene is much more harrowing than any display of fantastical  supernatural violence. Shame on Salles for making us sit through it.The ending doesn't sit well  either. Dahlia  seeing no other option  sacrifices herself  offering to be Natasha's mother \""forever\"" if she will let Ceci live. (Why? Those cracks she inflicted in the glass door looked pretty substantial--she should have kept smashing. Apparently being sprayed with icky-colored water is enough to make a grown woman give in. And since when do children boss around adults?) We see Dahlia walking off hand in hand with Natasha  as if she's decided that her separation from Ceci (and her own life) might not be so bad after all. Though she's probably vowed never to abandon her daughter  Dahlia ironically turns out to be no better than her own negligent mother.This film fails on all counts. Not scary (haunted washing machine? haunted Hello Kitty back pack?)  not sweet (\""whenever you need me  honey  I'll be here--the yucky drip in the elevator\"")  it's a sorry excuse for a story.\tOnce again  the great Hollywood Machine sucks in a really great film and spits out a completely worthless remake. The original Japanese DARK WATER (though highly derivative of THE RING) is creepy and scary and everything a good horror movie should be. In it's American incarnation  however  all the life has been sucked out of it and what's left is dull  dull  dull. I can't even give it credit for the great cast because it's so utterly BAD. It's sad that many people might be turned off to seeking out real Japanese horror movies because a lot of the Americanized versions are churned out by hacks who just don't get it.Avoid.\tThis movie is good for those who like rain or thunderstorms. The movie was actually not worth seeing. No real plot  bad acting  bad editing  and pointless. The apartment setting could have really saved the movie  but it remained unclear what the directors wanted us to do-that is- to be scared stiff  or to see the movie as a (family) drama. In addition the whole separation \""thingy\"" only added length to the movie as opposed to aiding the overall plot. Many parts of the movie were very predictable  with many plots already presented during the promotion of the film. In addition  the acting is very unoriginal  as many themes in the movie could be found in the Ring  Darkness Falls  to name a few.\tI'm going to begin by saying that people who say that this is not like the Ring are not completely wrong  but they are not completely right either. This movie has PLENTY in common with the Ring--the water  the ghostly girl  and some other factors that might be considered as spoilers on here. But the thing is that we accept most of the things that happen in the Ring. That is not the same here. Most of the events that go on in this movie are pointless. I went over the story a few times and tried to tie in certain things that stood out a lot. It drags for a long time and I know why  but these writers could have told the story much more quickly and it still would have made sense. \""Made sense\""--I use that term loosely because almost nothing here makes sense  especially when this ends. The ghostly girl--the imaginary friend of the mother's daughter--is what messes this up for me. The story is about a troubled woman: so much trauma has occurred throughout her life and she is facing a very difficult situation when the film starts  and it is almost like the dark water is closing in on her. Stop it right there. That calls for a psychological thriller  which is what this REMOTELY is. The movie could have done away with a lot of things and been pretty fair. But we will get away from there and go to the good characteristics. The atmosphere and music are good  reinforcing the dark and dank visuals. The images and the symbolism are both well-done. And the acting  especially by Connelly  is solid and decent. It is too bad that these good characteristics could not be incorporated into a better film. This just drowns itself in its own darkness of confusion and pointlessness. And as for the scare factor: it is not scary at all. Most people would probably find it disturbing  but not scary. If you enjoyed the Ring and/or the Ring 2 (which was as disappointing as this)  then you will like this and see the clarity through the water =) 4.8/10 Stars\tDark Water isn't necessarily a horror film involving supernatural events. It could simply be the tale of a crazy woman whose mother was crazy  and whose daughter is also crazy. Think about that while you're watching it.A ghost doesn't kill Dahlia in the end  she commits suicide. Same as her mother did. And her daughter is still talking to an \""imaginary friend.\"" They're nuts  no ghosts involved.Another good \""parallel theme\"" film is Paul Verhoeven's \""Total Recall.\"" You never know if Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is experiencing his virtual spy vacation or really saving Mars from destruction. I found \""Dark Water\"" to be much less subtle about the parallel themes. References to Dahlia's state of mental health are made almost constantly throughout the film.\tOkay  for starters  this movie is NOT scary worth my life. No jumps  no scary faces  only a soft child's voice. The story is basically the same as the Ring only there are ZERO jumps. At least in the ring I jumped in the beginning closet seen but thats about it. There's nothing to connect to the real world about the movie to scare you. The movie is more suspense then anything  and there isn't much suspense! Half the movie they are deciding on whether or not to get the apartment. Nothing scary  they are just looking at the apartment. The only thing that is decent about the movie is the end. Most of the things don't connect. And once again  I would like to say that this movie SUCKS!! As in  there is nothing in it. For most of the time I was waiting for it to start. In the end I was thinking it just started.\tI think this movie was one of the worst i have seen in a long time. I am a big movie person  my friends and I go every Friday to see a new movie! This time we went thinking i was going to see a scary movie  but boy was i wrong! In my opinion the whole plot was dumb. I don't even think i could see any potential in this movie. Like the part where the parents left the other little girl and all that! I just don't understand why you would make a dumb movie! That is just my opinion of the movie! If i could get my money back i surely would! I didn't even want to watch the whole movie but i figured if i spent $7.50 on the movie  no matter how bad it was  i needed to watch it! My Advice  don't watch the movie  and don't rent it... wait until it comes on t.v!\tWith \""Dark Water \"" I'm convinced that there exists a fundamental difference between Japan and the US as to what constitutes a narrative. True  this is an American remake of the Japanese hit. It furthermore seems a bit of a tenuous position to decry foreign conceptions of horror as a native of a country responsible for nearly a dozen flicks about a homicidal hockey goalie. But  along with the two \""Ring\"" movies and \""The Grudge \"" \""Dark Water\"" seems to be a deliberate test of how much silliness we'll tolerate in a film. Based on the overall box office of these movies so far  the current answer seems to be somewhere in the neighborhood of \""quite a lot.\"" The outlines of \""Dark Water\"" will be familiar to anyone who's seen any of the previous American renditions of Japanese boo flicks. There's an ornery kiddie ghoul  a daughter with a worrisome \""imaginary\"" friend  and plenty of frightening moisture. Perhaps the notable absence of any conditions or rules within which these elements operate is the very thing that audiences interpret as scares. To me  though  the water of a washing machine turning black  for example  is not inherently chilling. Odd  perhaps. An annoying inconvenience  certainly. But lacking any cues to the contrary  I'm unlikely to spend much time worrying that it could in fact be an indication of an unruly underage aqua-phantom lurking in the apartment above me; a demon that can not only follow my daughter to school  but can wreak havoc with property values as well by unleashing otherworldly wet spots on my unsuspecting ceiling.A movie with no central conceit puts nothing at stake for us. The events of \""Dark Water\"" have no impact; they occur because they can  not because they must. Indeed  for someone who spends most of the film annoyed by what she assumes are plumbing problems  and dealing with her daughter's rocky adaptation to her new school  Jennifer Connelly is surprisingly ready to make an abrupt leap into the supernatural by the film's climax. \""Dark Water\"" is like a feature-length trailer; full of enticing and creepy imagery that you hope will be fleshed out in the film. The Japanese horror invasion shows no signs of slowing  and I'm still waiting.\tI almost cried!!!! What have they done to Hideo Nakata's masterpiece?!?!?! I have to confess to being against the idea of a remake of this one since I have seen the original Ring and remake The Ring and was unimpressed with the remake. The whole film was a lot more blatant than it should have been in my opinion  everything was spelled out  there was hardly any tension or chill built up in direct contrast with the original.I had issues with the use of the bag and coat. The bag and coat were things that I had serious issues with also. In Hideo Nakata's stunning masterpiece  a lot is made of the little red bag and it's reappearance and the fact that the little girl has a distinctive yellow mack is well used in the style of Don't Look Now. One scene in particular where Yoshimi is going up to the roof and the door is open just a crack and you see the Mitsuko in her yellow mack walk past the door. It's really good. In the remake  both Natasha and Ceci are seen wearing a red coat and no big deal is made of it.My big problem  as you may have predicted  is the ending (isn't it always). In the Japanese version  Yoshimi goes up to the roof and climbs the water tower  she figures out what has happened and then  after the spookiness of something/someone punching through the tank  goes into the flat to find Ikuko passed out on the floor of the bathroom floor. She picks her up and carries her to the lift  which get stuck  then there is the tension building moment as Yoshimi watches the door of her flat open  expecting to see Mitsuko appear  but it's Ikuko. Then Mitsuko  a decomposed child  hugs and almost throttles Yoshimi. Yoshimi realises that there is no point struggling and that the only way to save Ikuko is to look after Mitsuko. She hugs her and tells her she is her mother and she shouts at Ikuko to stay back. Then the lift doors close and Ikuko is crying  looking through the window  Yoshimi looks back for a moment then looks at Mitsuko. The lift goes up and the haunting music escalates. Ikuko runs up the stairs and looks in the lift shaft. She can't see anything so she sits on the floor. Next thing the lift doors open and Ikuko is covered in water. It is a truly beautiful and moving scene. You sit there looking at poor little Ikuko lying in the pool of water  soaked through  sobbing for her mother and your heart just tears.Remake  Dahlia puts Ceci in the bath and then is on the phone. She sees a little girl in a hooded dressing gown walk past here and assumes it's Ceci. She starts to read her a story and then hears Ceci in the bath. She basically rejects Natasha and then Natasha goes into the bathroom and starts to drown Ceci. When Dahlia breaks into the bathroom she starts to bargain with Natasha \""what do you want?\"" etc. Then she tells Natasha to take her and leave Ceci alone. Then you see Dahlia's body being carried out  blatantly dead  as opposed to the original where Yoshimi just vanishes.The very final scene in the original is 10 years later when Ikuko is in the area where she used to live as she is going to visit a friend. She says she can't remember being at kindergarten  and she finds herself walking back to her old apartment. There she sees her mother and they chat  she complains that no-one told her that her mother was living here and asks Yoshimi if she can come and live with her. Yoshimi says that she is sorry that Ikuko can't come and live with her. You then see Mitsuko in the background  behind Ikuko and when Ikuko turns around  Mitsuko and Yoshimi both disappear. Ikuko then says \""my mother was here all this time  protecting me.\"" It's a beautiful ending. In the remake  Ceci returns 3 weeks later and her mother appears to her in the lift. It just doesn't work.There you go  end of tirade. See them for yourself.\tRemember \""The Ring\""? Same story. Opening credits  family  building  water deposit with children's bag beside it... OK  five minutes and we already know where the missing girl is  can we go on with the rest of the movie now? We know how it will end  so let's know more about the girl (one hour of dark water dripping from the ceiling)... OK  done that  find girl in deposit but WAIT!  it's not over yet. Ghost comes back  kills mom  nice ending. DUH! Two good things. First: they play around with the \""insane mother\"" thing for a while  enough to make you wonder \""is it all in her head?\""  but they keep her credibility standing instead of making another \""crazy mother sees ghost and: option a) it's all in her head; option b) the ghost is real\"" movie. Second: the characters are simple people but nicely played by great actors that never exaggerate in their roles.\tSadly  this is just another Japanese chiller flick about a dead little girl who was killed (or abandoned) by her mother  and trying to kill another little child to earn a new mother. Quite like The Ring  it had some depth  but majorly lacks originality  especially since it came out after The Ring.I had been waiting to see this movie for several months  when I saw it first advertised  and I got half of what I was looking for in the movie. It did put me on edge for a while  and Jennifer Connily did play a great part. But  again  it does lack originality  and didn't have the most frightening storyline. What is it that the author  Koji Suzuki  has with little girls pretty much being drowned in a well type area by their mothers  and then attacking little boys or girls to steal their mother? I just don't understand it.Oh well.... What can you do...?\tAlthough I found it generally engaging I can't really recommend Brazilian filmmaker Walter Salles \""Dark Water\"" for a wide audience. Imagine a cross between Polanski's \""The Apartment\"" and \""Sixth Sense\""; although not nearly as good. Still if you liked those films this is worth viewing. It is just as claustrophobic as \""Apartment\"" and as washed out color-wise as \""Sixth Sense\""  but it lacks the suspense buildup of either.The pacing is about the same as Polanski's slower stuff  but his slow pacing is designed to allow the viewer to read all the things he sprinkles throughout the film. Salles's film lacks most of these little sidelights although the malfunctioning washing machines (washer sounds are normally comforting because they remind us of our mother's heartbeat) and the Hello Kitty backpack are certainly Polanski worthy.Salles does a great job directing with the children  Connelly is wonderful as usual  and except for poor audio the production itself is first class. You won't get all that creeped out by the many drips  leaks  and gushers but there is one very startling scene where Connelly discovers that she is reading a story to the wrong daughter. This scene is even more scary if you have already figured out that this daughter is Connelly herself at age six. Salles did not do a very good job making this connection; Perla Haney-Jardine plays both little girls but it is not all that obvious. Once you have it the other pieces fall into place and the film makes sense. Unfortunately that may not happen until you have left the theater.Salles should have gone out on the door closing behind Ariel Gade as she leaves the building with her hair braided. The short montage afterward takes away from the final scene in the elevator."""
Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo (2005),"There were a couple of funny scenes in this movie  but they were all within the first 20 minutes. The funniest part of the movie is where Deuce ends up eating a bunch of \Space Cake\"" aka pot brownies and gets really stoned  and then naively asks: \""There's drugs in space cake?\"" when being questioned.That's the funniest line in this whole movie  which is kind of pathetic.Deuce Bigalow is back  and I haven't seen the first one and after seeing this I don't want to. He's now become obsessed with fish because his wife was killed by a shark on their honeymoon. He carries around a (wooden version of her leg?) I believe.But of course  his old pimp friend T.J. needs help in Amsterdam  so our Naive Deuce goes there.T.J. ends up being framed for man-whore murders so Deuce must go undercover again as a man-whore to learn if any of this one man-whore's women had any motive to kill him.This is the point when the movie falls into complete awfulness and vomitittude. Here are a few scenes that you will \""Experience\"" if you actually go to this piece of crud.1. TJ eating FRIES OUT OF A TOILET. 2. A \""giant woman\"" offering Deuce her boobies. 3. A woman with a hole in her throat 4. A woman with a penis for a nose who cums when she sneezes.Skip this movie unless you're an idiot. Surprisingly people were laughing in the theater... A LOT.\tAfter reading the previous comment about this film and the reviewer subsequently rating the film a 1/10 and going on to criticise Hollywood in general  i wish to portray a wholly more open view about this COMEDY. Get a sense of humour and get it fast  this film is indeed crude it is indeed crammed full of sexual innuendo's but that's the point.I didn't go into the theatre expecting much in the way of a plot  and came out very pleasantly surprised by just how funny this film actually was..........its not smart comedy  its not subtle...its in your face  brash and sometimes down right disgusting  but it did what few \""comedies\"" have managed to do this year and thats bring a genuine smile to my face.Comedy in my humble opinion has lost something that it had in the nineties. That little something is making a film out of nothing  where not much actually happens  and yet an hour and a half rolls by and you wonder where it went. It has lost the zaniness of such films as Dumb and Dumber  Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison....now i don't mean to place Deuce Bigalow European Gigalo into their sort of league but it follows their formula. It is a formula that still works! The partnership here of Rob Schneider and Eddie Griffin works ever so well  within 5 minutes of the film starting when they visit the coffeshop was in stitches. It didn't stop there  the laughs are simple but constant and left me in a great mood by the end of the film!! People need to stop criticising this genre and accept it for what it is. A barrel of crude laughs  where you can let your hair down  put your feet up and know that you are going to be entertained.\tBasically there are going to be two types of people who will watch this movie  those who feel that sex is something not to be feared and can be joked about  and those who still feel that sex is evil  sinful  and that those who joke about sex will be damned to the eternal pit of flames. For those of you who are not uptight about sex  this movie is hilarious. Rob Schneider doesn't give a crap about what anybody thinks about him  and in todays society of suffocating ultra-conservative puritans  that's a breath of fresh air. Why? Because this movie jokes about taboo subjects  and pulls them out from underneath the rug. Sexuality is part of being human and the human experience  and it should be confronted  not hidden. How could anyone be shocked or surprised at all by the subject matter in this movie? Isn't it completely obvious that Mr. Schneider is a pervert by now? This is the SEQUEL to a notoriously perverted movie for God's sakes and has been upped to rated \""R\""! What in the the heck do you expect!?! A Christmas story!?! Yes this movie is filled with tons of perverted sexual jokes  but the truth is more than half the people in the world probably have a sexually perverted side to them  and they keep it hidden in the closet. I think everyone should stop being hypocrites and just go let their inner perverts enjoy this movie.\tI enjoyed this movie for its crude humor. I make no apologies for that  I like this sort of movie. I did not go in expecting an Academy award winning movie  I expected crude jokes  strange euphemisms for he-parts  and total irreverence  and I came out satisfied. If you do not enjoy bawdy humor and some times in your face grossness then don't even bother.Some of the parts I especially enjoyed were the gigolo museum  and the scene with Antoine. This movie made me laugh  but I won't pretend that it was a moving love story like \""50 First Dates\"" or a great comedy like some of the other Happy Madison films. A word of advice if you are going to see it in theaters  I would (and did) see it at the half price showing. If you are expecting something clean and sensitive look elsewhere. This movie is a lot cruder than the first one  but still very enjoyable if you like that sort of thing. As a side bar all the European gigolos were not at all difficult to look at. This movie was refreshing in that it did not take its self too seriously unlike most sequels of today.\tThe movie's about what you would expect from reading the title: a short running length  and a pretty large variety of gross-out gags (some of them quite creative actually). It goes without saying that this is meant to be raunchy and pointless  and while it succeeds on those two levels  you should wait for it to come out on video. Not exactly \""run-to-the-theater\"" material. Some of the jokes work  but a lot of them fall flat. There isn't much of a story here  just a thin semblance of a mystery to hang gags on. Not that there's anything wrong with that--but it just doesn't work as well as you might hope. This is potty humor through and through  folks. Don't go in expecting much else.\tAs this movie has the label dumb all over it  no intelligent film critic with a sense of self-esteem likes himself to be associated with this movie  so they go out of their way to immediately discard this as utter nonsense and be the first to give it one  zero or minus one points or stars. This is not the greatest comedy ever made  but luckily it has still some things on offer they don't like to acknowledge.The humor is in the line of a comedy tradition started by Kentucky Fried Chicken  later used in Airplane! (there is a direct reference here with the announcement of the red and white zones) and the Naked Gun-series and has of course SNL-influences. The idea is you throw in that many jokes there will always be some worthwhile for someone. Pacing does the rest and you need of course a large audience willing to laugh for more than one hour. Its humor is overall crude and politically incorrect (but that's where the R rating is for).Several jokes are successful: The dolphin part at the beginning  but also frequent jokes about the presidency of Bush and the invasion of Iraq  to counter that there is a Frenchman being rather irritating. Also funny to see the image Americans have of Amsterdam and vice versa being exaggerated to the extreme. There's another joke where a truck of weed is stopped and ticketed by police  only because it is not the right time to unload your truck (Amsterdam in a nutshell).Despite some successful basic jokes and a lot of unsuccessful ones  they could have spoofed more movies. Also no effort is made (maybe deliberately) to tell a coherent story: There is for example a flashback of the death of Deuce's wife  but the story is never finished. The ending is a direct copy of The Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult  as it ends with a bomb scare on the equivalent of the Academy Awards Ceremony for man-whores  although the remembrance of dead man-whores is funny again. One final note: the trailer is a lot worse than the movie itself.\tWow  I think I am being to nice with the two. This movie sucked  I wasted 10 dollars to go see this  The only reason I saw it was because Rob Schnieder was in it  and his movies are always funny  but at the end of this movie  I totally lost my respect for this movie and this actor  after this. I hated this movie. There was no humour and way to much nudity. I am officially scarred for like  and the things that happen in that movie or so disgusting. I think this movie sucked  and so do a lot of others  so if you want to watch a movie  i suggest going to see a Hilary Duff movie because at least there is the point to those childish movies  this movie was pure crap. I think that if you really want to see it  you should wait to rent it but even then you wasting your money.\tThis sequel has nothing to do with the original. The humor is dumb  the jokes are mindless  there are (unfunny!!!) jokes about murderers  oral sex  and so on. This movie is unfunny  and I don't see its laughter. This movie is sexually offensive and I will never watch it. Please  DON'T WATCH \""DEUCE BIGALOW: European GIGLO\""! STOP YOUR CURIOSITY.I don't like this movie. It is stupid  pointless  unfunny  and even worse than the original. This movie is overacted and also overrated. I think this movie is awful  tasteless and is a bad sequel. There are repeated references to sex acts  penes and vaginae  homosexuality  bestiality  tricking  and pimping.My Rating: 1 out of 10.\tThis movie was fantastic. A lot of the people who didn't like it didn't understand the jokes or allow themselves to accept the good humor. It was fantastically written and like the first Duece Bigalo - will be a sleeper classic. I totally recommend seeing this movie in the theater with a large group of friends. Please keep an open mind when watching it because if you do not choose to then you will find the movie very unenjoyable. It contains a lot of humor that older adults wouldn't find very funny but the teen-generation would find very funny. I was laughing nonstop. Eddie Griffin and Rob Schiender are a winning combination. If the Oscars had some sort comedy category  this movie would definitely fall in to that category!\tPlease please smite this film with all your godly powers  please wipe it from the face of the earth forever and ever  including the DVD release. I pray that thou wilt smite Rob Schneider fans too if you have a couple of moments. Please help them see the error of their ways  for they know not what is funny  because sight gags need context to work properly. Please help them see that the basic premise is flawed  that a woman doesn't have to pay for sex  and would certainly not pay Rob Schneider for sex. Our father please fix it so that no more Rob Schneider movies are ever made again  ever ever ever.Thank you god. Over and out.\tSame H  New Lo. Thats its Tagline and that says it all. The films very low standard is what you like or what you don't like. People that are negative about this film should not go see another DB film  because you know what too expect.This film has some stupid stuff in it like Rob Schneider saying that the Dutch started the slave trade which is untrue  but it's just one of those things about The Netherlands that are assumed and talked about as if true  and particularly about Amsterdam some preconceptions exist as well. In DB: EG  Amsterdam comes across as the world capital of sleazyness and thats an image a lot of Americans have  but it's grossly exaggerated  just like anything else in this movie. Some jokes were fine  some were poor  but Rob delivers just what you can expect when you've seen the first DB. So go see it if you like this kind of humour  and forget the negative reviews.\tDon't waste your time thinking it's just a bunch of Rob Schneider-hater's posting these bad reviews.... Somebody clearly must have lost control of this project early on. Complete waste of time  won't even watch this on cable. It's sad  as I had generally thought Rob Schneider to be a funny guy.. It's beyond me how a project like this actually makes it to general release.... Don't be drawn in by the commercials  it's truly a bait-and-switch that won't hold up in the actual screening.. I read in Roger Ebert's review how Schneider took a full-page ad out busting somebody who said this movie stunk....the fact that he went so out of his way seems  at best  a bit clumsy with this project. I hope he recovers  but this movie was not the star to hang your hat on...\tI am rating it a nine because it is really good for a Rob Schneider movie. I laughed throughout the whole movie. Deuce runs to Europe after creating a dolphin incident in the states. TJ incriminates himself in a string of male gigolo killings so Deuce takes up male whoring again to clear TJ's name. There is a lot of sexual humor and the movie deserves the R rating and it maybe should have been rated NC-17. This movie isn't as good as the first but it really isn't as bad as all the reviews say. I liked it because the movie made me laugh out loud. Everyone in the theater was laughing. Some of the humor is over the top and the constant names of different sexual positions is annoying since most people have no idea what they are and the viewers can only guess at their meanings. Norm McDonald is great in it with his bit part and of course Adam Sandler has a small cameo. I am a Rob Schneider fan and he is perfect in this movie.\tHow low can you get? Not as low as Duece Bigalow: European Gigolo. There's a scene in a restaurant. The woman has a tracheostomy (a hole in her throat usually because of lung cancer.) When she drinks wine it sprays out of the hole onto Rob Schneider. Later water spews out of the hole. Just dreadful. I'm surprised this movie didn't make fun of cripples. The movie is one unfunny penis joke after another as you can see from the poster. These people ought to be ashamed of themselves. Wasting their time on this awful piece of trash. The trailer contains the \""best\"" scenes. These alone are dreadful. The rest of the movie is even worse. There was not one person laughing in the theater. Many walked out.\tsorry if i sound like I'm talking from every which way but i am writing this little comment just shortly after watching this debacle of a film. might i say that in my opinion this movie is crude  insulting  disgusting  humiliating  undignified and so on...in every way that brings down the human race..even going as far as showing that we are no better than animals or if not even worse. every second was another gruesome sex related joke being fully seen on the good IL' theater screen. the language was filthy with sexual innuendoes every other second  and the screen was trite with sexual content. Oh and the plot itself...beyond inane! if i wasn't there with my friend i would have left the theater about 20 minutes into the film. If that is all that rob schneider can do to attempt to make an audience laugh then he needs to give it up along with the writers and directors and just go into the porno industry if they are that obsessed with sex that much. ill be the first to say this comment wasn't very useful..but its my opinion on how low Hollywood has come or the movie industry in general...focusing about sex in a movie like this every second like we just invented it. if you have the slightest bit of decency in you.....DON'T SEE THIS FILM! thank you for reading this\tHere comes another sequel to a classic comedy Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo. If anybody ever wanted to see an 80 minute penis joke  then this movie is definitely for you. The first film which came out about 4 years ago gave us a new concept and introduced us to the most memorable characters. In fact  it is one of my favorite comedies. In the sequel we learn that Kate has been eaten by sharks (what a terrible way to kill off somebody) and that T.J. is working in Amsterdam. Somebody is killing off all male gigolos in Amsterdam one by one. T.J. calls on Deuce to help him find out who is the serial killer by becoming a man-whore decoy. From the very beginning to the last minute of the movie virtually every line contained a penis joke... While some moments are funny  they are very repetitive and at times offensive. If you watch many scenes carefully  it looks like the whole movie was done in front of the blue screen. This film is another proof not to make sequels of great films.\tIn 2 words: Don't Bother I didn't go into this film looking for Citizen Kane  but looking for some laughs  as well as the usual off-color humor. What I didn't expect is the baseless ridicule of handicapped people. I saw a film that had poor acting  inept sexual humor  worn-out roles  and overall  an immature plot that got worse as the movie went on. Deuce Bigelow (Rob Schneider) travels to Europe to avoid the police after his invention causes havoc with some dolphins and blind senior citizens. What a great way to start a movie: blind people getting mangled by dolphins! Duece tries to assist his pimp friend TJ (Eddie Griffin) who is falsely accused of being a serial murderer  gets mixed up with the Inspector's daughter Eva (Hanna Verboom) who has OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disease) and is put up for ridicule each time she has a seizure. Its supposed to be funny  but misses the mark completely and makes fun of those that may be effected by this disorder.Many of the \""jokes\"" were just plain wrong. Leave out the Penis-nose and the throat hole. If these are the only things funny that you can find to write about  do us all a favor and go away!In the end  Duece saves the day by finding the bomb which is slated to destroy all the members of the Man-Whore Society. My rating: 2 stars out of 10 At least the popcorn was good  and the theater was air-conditioned. And I'm thankful that I paid matin\u00e9e prices to get in. It's not worth full-price admission.\tThis movie is dreadful. It takes place in Amsterdam with endless unfunny jokes about nudity and hash/marijuana. Whatever charm and surprise in the first movie is totally gone in this sequel. For example  Eddie Griffin's boat with the water on the floor - nothing is done with the setup. Concerning the murders  it is clear who \""did it\"" in the opening ten minutes. The only joke I laughed at was about Eddie Griffin passing gas at an inopportune moment in the \""library.\"" When passing gas is the highlight of the film  you know you have a dog.And all the jokes about women with problems is now old and actually sad in that we are now reduced to laughing at women who have physical or mental problems. Yeh  really funny stuff! If you are stupid or a sociopath. Rob and Eddie are much funnier than this turkey.\tI picked this movie over Fantastic 4 tonight. That was possibly the biggest mistake of my life.The movie starts with a Gigolo murder  but obviously the whole plot is eclipsed by horrible and gross jokes.Deuce ends up in Amsterdam where DJ (or is it TJ) is doing a hydraulic thing with his boat  what the hell? So then they get to the thing about Pot being legalized. Duece get's high and ends up on nibbling DJ  who is trying to prove he's not a homosexual  but fails each time.So when DJ is seen looking at the \""package\"" of a killed gigolo  he is accused of being the killer  and extremely gay  this happens a lot at an annoying level.Deuce then has to prove him innocent  and thus ends up seeing all the girls that the killed gigolo's dated.Up first is as I quote \""Deuce BigGEST LADY I'VE EVER SEEN\"". She makes him dress as a baby since she can't have kids  psychotic AND stupid.Then Duece meets the daughter of the \""Cheif Inspector\"" who reacts to objects cause of a disorder.Next is a girl who must smoke a lot cause she's got a hole in her throat. Here you see some of the sickest jokes ever. At a restaurant  she blows out the smoke through the hole  and when she drinks the wine  it comes out of the hole  and Duece has to plug it  and then she hiccups  and well it took me all my effort to NOT vomit.Then is a girl who's mother worked at Chernobyl  and she was born with a penis as a nose. Another sick joke is that it get's erect  and ejaculates when she sneezes.Eventually DJ get's arrested and we discover that the \""Inspector\"" is the killer. He wants to kill the Gigalo's cause they are destroying Hollnad (as this happens 3 Canadians urinate)  they also made him accidentally destroy his penis.So then Duece has to stop him  which he does. At the end  the girl with the dick-nose trips and her noes falls into the smoker-girls' throat hole. Not only is that disgusting  but it's taken right from Sienfeld. (oneo f the programs there is \""Naked Seinfeld\"") So in the end  this is horrible. Save your money.Don't even get the DVD\tAs good as the first  but not better. Lots of laughs  my only complaint is that the girls Deuce dates aren't that more creative than the first batch. It's also too short  but it's full of cheap  raunchy  gross  offensive laughs. If you find that kind of retard humor funny like me...then you will love it. For fans of the first movie  this one won't let you down. Show your support and maybe we'll see a third movie! . . . . ............. ................... ............. .......... ................ ................... .................... ............................. ................. .................. ....... ................ .............. ................ .................."""
Diary of a Mad Black Woman (2005),"A deep and serious drama. Not the silly comedy the trailer suggests  although the \star\"" does humorous African-American characters Eddie Murphy style. Themes: divorce  transformation  forgiveness  romance  sadness. Reviewers seem to love or hate it. If you like a movie with a spiritual theme  exploring issues of how someone handles horrible betrayal and starts over  with romance  a handsome man and a beautiful woman  peppered with comedic family characters  you will probably like this movie. Strong Christian moral themes. Definitely a chick flick but my guy liked it too. Even the teenage boys in the room seemed to enjoy. Anyone who has ever been through a painful divorce will relate.\tI had reservations when I got the bootleg copy of this movie and  I was deeply surprised when I saw this movie. Shemar Moore is improving his creditability as an serious actor. Kimberly Elise! What can I say about her? Her performance is what makes the movie. Tyler Perry ought to be commended for this production  and I hope Hollywood recognize his talents and make more movies with him to come. Kimberly Elise will and probably be nominated for an Oscar for this role. She will be the next African-American to win for Best Actress without being light-skinned(ala.. Halle Berry). All in all this is a feel good movie that will bring people of color together and understand that God is with all of us through the good and as well as the bad.\tAt first I was skeptical about renting this film and had no intentions of watching it. Not only was it romantic  it didn't seem that it would entertain me as much as I would like. But with all the less than mediocre films coming out of movie theaters today  I was willing to take a chance and sit down open minded. And I have to say that I honestly loved this movie. It was the best I'd seen in awhile. It was hilarious  cute and sweet and it made sense. This wasn't some big budget romantic comedy that only cared about style  sex and satisfying what the hungry sex-crazed public wants at times. (Or at least what they think we want). It had a point and was moving. Kimberly Elise was wonderful and I think that she is no doubt one of the best actresses out there. Shemar Moore was extremely beautiful and touching as usual. I personally think that Tyler Perry is a genius. They don't make movies like this anymore. Especially African-American movies. There's more to the culture than gangs  drugs  sex and rap music. And unfortunately  the media doesn't show that anymore and rarely did in the first place. I was also pleased with the fact that the movie used black actors instead of the trend of hiring rap artists who lack acting talent but can bring in an audience because of their name. It was finally good to see a movie like this this. Great job to the cast and especially to Tyler Perry.\tI have not been to a movie in a while and I was not able to go due to medical conditions (at the time)   but I know Tyler Perry and I own all of his plays so I knew this would be great. Oh my God this is the best movie I have seen all year. Whether you know Tyler Perry or not from his famous gospel plays or not this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh  cry  think and wonder and definitely make you think twice about the way you treat others. Above all you will be happy if you go to see it or purchase it. Be ready to laugh though (my side hurt) The talent in this movie is just overwhelming. But the voices are even bigger with the music presented. Especially from little Tiffany Evans who is twelve years old but sounds 25. Tyler you are highly anointed my brother.:-)\tTyler Perry has his Eddie Murphy moments with the character Joe (who really wasn't particularly necessary)  and although Madea has \""Big Momma\"" tendencies at time  overall she's compassionate and real. She's meant as comic relief  but at times is written as serious. She's better that way. Her strong-will is a key to the movie.Elise is a good actress and is decent in this movie. The opening scene and her relationship with her husband seems so over-the-top. But my mouth admittedly dropped when his clear-cut infidel family actually is extended beyond the woman. It's one thing to cheat  quite another to literally have a second family. My apologies if that sucks juice from you.We knew how the movie would end from the previews  not to mention the evident happenings to Steve Harris's character were so heavily foreshadowed the acting was downright horrible. But Shemar Moore is more that applicable for this movie. Those chiding him as purely a Soap actor are not unfair; however  he is convincing. I believe his pursuit is in earnest and the knowing struggle of Elise's character.Elise's character is pathetic at times and Moore gives us a trite statement to sum it up; however  it is central to the movie. You do find yourself saying to the screen \""What are you doing Helen?\"" It's clear she needs closure and in a she-devil type of way she begins to receive it. Irony is ever-present in this movie  but best presented when Elise is making herself more miserable when exacting her revenge. It's moments like these that Madea gives sensible advice that appears rather natural.Tyler Perry does have himself in the flesh in this movie and is a fleshy  decent character. I feel for him  but he certainly is overly tight when trying to eliminate memories of struggle and the ending concerning him is too tidy  whilst Elise is over dramatic  and Steve Harris is unquenched. But I like it at the same time because sometimes when calm and at peace  sense arrives. It arrives here.Elise and Perry  combined with Shemar Moore and at times Steve Harris do the movie justice  while it was a good casting call to get \""Star Search\"" star Tiffany Evans as Perry's daughter. Harris is so callous it doesn't seem real sometimes; moreover  it is certainly pointed in favor of Helen. It didn't take that much extraneous writing to figure that out or get us to feel that way. But slowly it is revealed how poor this relationship really was. Elise borders on overacting here  but mostly gives grit to the movie.Perry has messages to give and never subtly delivers them  yet the movie is decent  a bit mushy  and a touch long. It is a five-minute story that most develop as it does: over time.\tThere seemed to be two movies in one - supposed comedy from Madea and the dramatic story of a young woman finding herself after an emotionally barren and abusive marriage. The movie would have been strong enough to stand on its own without Madea. She was distracting  out of place and not funny at all. She was a caricature and a tired stereotype of the big  soul-food cooking  gun-toting black Southern grandma.At first  I wasn't sure if I would like this movie or watch it all the way through -- all because of Helen's gutless and whining behavior. It didn't feel realistic to me and seemed way over the top in both the husband's casual cruelty and Helen's meek acceptance of his behavior. No woman is going to just whine and whinny when her husband brings his other woman into their house and orders her out. I don't care what race the woman is or how well bred she is supposed to be.Helen was a sniveling  weak  lazy excuse for a woman who seemed to have her head buried in the sand for the last 18 years. It wouldn't take anyone with half a brain  18 years to realize what a cruel  selfish and unfeeling person her spouse had turned into. Helen has herself to blame for her predicament. She didn't try to better herself in any way during the course of her marriage  didn't put any money aside (she didn't have a career or goals of any kind)  didn't seem to do any type of volunteer activities or help others less fortunate than herself. She claimed she wanted kids - since she didn't have them  she could have worked with kids and made a real difference in someone's life. Helen was comfortable in her role as the rich  idle prop for her husband and looked to him to give her meaning and value. It seemed like her Christian values only kicked in after she had been humiliated and dragged from her home. I didn't feel sorry for her then either  because she didn't fight back or stand up for herself in any way. Even going to court to legally claim what was rightfully hers seemed too much effort for her. Even after she moved into Madea's house  she could have taken some college courses or some sort of training to assist her in getting a well paying and interesting job. She only went to work as a waitress because Madea wasn't going to let her mooch forever.I didn't like or respect this character at all. I felt she treated Orlando much the same way Charles had treated her and if I were Orlando  I wouldn't have taken her back. Helen was selfish to the very end and no better than her husband. I think they actually deserved one another and should have remained together. Orlando deserved much better than Helen. A hardworking  intelligent  witty and kind man is someone every woman wants and often doesn't have. Helen should have cherished him.Surprisingly enough  I did enjoy this film for many reasons and none of them had to do with race  over-the-top acting  or Madea's ridiculous behavior. I thought the last scene in the church was extremely moving and powerful - not Charles' getting up and walking down the aisle (cheesy and predictable)  but the former crack head wife making the effort to rehab herself and be with the family that she loved and who loved her. I cried when she walked down the aisle singing. I think this was a way to show us that a belief in God can change your life and help you to do anything you set your mind too. The character wanted her family life back and knew that it was up to her to stop doing drugs and turn her life around  so that she could be reunited with them. She relied on her faith  willpower and determination and God heard her cry for help and she was blessed. That is a lovely message for anyone to witness. If the movie said nothing else - that message was enough.\tOverall  this movie is more of a drama than it is a comedy. If you want to see this  please know that you're renting a movie that is a mix of comedy and drama. But this movie was very good and I liked it a lot. Some romances are okay with me like this one and Hitch  and others that are part music and romance creep me out. All of the bad reviews on this movie shouldn't be paid attention to because it was a movie with conflict and heart. Sure  it might be very tense  but without Madea and her brother in the movie  it would be absolutely nothing. My point mainly is that this is a great movie that you can watch with your kids and your husband/wife  as long as the kids are at a proper age.\tThis film is better suited for a night at bible study rather than a night at the movies. Not only is the plot a brow-beaten clich\u00e9  it is virtually unrealistic. The idea that a woman would console a man who threw her out of her own house  had an extra-marital affair that resulted in two children  and left her completely broke is simply ridiculous. While the movie zealously preaches religious virtue  it completely fails to capture the reality of human nature.This movie may have been successful with some audiences  but I wholeheartedly dismiss it. Diary of a Mad Black Woman is merely an assemblage of clich\u00e9d  run-of-the-mill story lines tossed into one lackluster film. Its mediocre actors  constant use of poetic justice and religious moralizing are much too weak. Tyler Perry just should have left this one on the stage.\tIf you saw the previews for this movie and liked what you saw  don't be too excited. The hilarious \""Mad black woman\"" appears in about 20% of the movie (in which she is hilarious!). However  the movie is NOTHING like the preview. It is mostly a love story about a woman whose rich husband cheats on her and kicks her out of her house. I was so disappointed that I my night turned into a diary of a chubby Italian 30 year-old kid. We rented this movie and \""Cursed\"" on the same night. We would've gotten more enjoyment out of getting our bodies waxed from head to toe than from watching this 4 hours of garbage! Do not rent either one of these movies!! If you do  don't tell me that I didn't warn you! If you want a newer scary movie  watch \""Dawn of the Dead.\""\tTyler Perry is some kind of genius or something! The movie was an absolute delight to watch. My sister has seen it five times and I and our mother have seen the movie twice. It is wonderful!!His excellent portrayal of three characters was impressive to say the least.The musical score and other songs were so well presented and I thought all of supporting actors were very good as well.Mr. Perry knew that the leading lady's character was going to get on most black women's nerves--yet I am sure he achieved the impact intended before moving her into the \""get even\"" mode.Most of all the movie was one that everyone in the family could watch and not be insulted with unpleasant sex scenes  and over the edge vulgarity.This movie also had a inspiring message of hope and love.\tI really wasn't interested in any of Tyler Perry plays. I knew they were hugely popular but they really just seemed not to be my kind of entertainment. I saw \""Diary of a Mad Black Woman\"" and boy was I blown away. I was totally not what I expected. Kimberly Elise was  as always  out of this world. She has got some skills!!! Why don't we see her more(probably because she doesn't look like Halle)she is beautiful and just plain believable. Everyone was great. The ending was a bit much but by that time  I was already loving the film. I think they marketed this film wrong. The seemed to stress Madea's character too much in the trailers in stead of this surprisingly great story and plot. It was such a transcendent theme it could have been any woman diary. I hope Tyler Perry really makes some more great and inspiring films(would love to see him go beyond Madea although she is great) I am glad we are seeing other films where blacks are not pimps  druggies  hoes and single parents struggling in the ghetto all the time.\tI found this movie entertaining though I admit not the best movie ever made. The ideas are not original and it plays a bit like a black soap opera but for a FIRST movie by black playwright/author/producer/actor  new comer to Hollywood -- Tyler Perry  it was good enough to earn him a second try. What is original is Perry's ability to successfully walk the tightrope between telling a story of serious life/relationship issues and at the same time peppered with the outrageous humor of his alter-ego  pistol totin' sharp-tongued  granny- \""Madea\"" (Perry in drag). He uses Eddie Murphy (Klumps)/Martin Lawrence(Big Mama) humor to draw in the non-churched world to his allegories supporting not only Christian values  but universal moral values that lead to better lives for all. He keeps the adult humor clean enough to keep PG13 rating and there is little if any  cussing and no sex scenes. Another treat was seeing the regal Cicely Tyson in her first movie role in 10 yearsIt is a story about a black woman(played with beauty by Kimberly Elise) done wrong by her successful but abusive lawyer husband(Steve Harris) and her dilemma on how to deal with the disgrace of a divorce after being married for 17 years. In the meantime she gets help from her grandma 'Madea' and other family members and the laughter begins 'cause Madea don't take no mess!Perry shows he's just as good as Murphy/Lawrence by playing 3 roles in the movie PLUS he wrote the movie and let them use his own mansion-of-a-home in Atlanta to shoot in as the house of the lawyer.Expect more to come from Mr Perry b/c he comes with a base fan club of African American churchgoers nationwide (mostly women) who have seen and loved his very successful plays performed for years in playhouses across America.. Now he should garner more fans through movies/dvds-- because his themes are universal about family  love and how to make it in this world no matter what nationality or race etc.He may  find it difficult to make it however without Madea and Joe  the characters that really put the butts in the seats\tThis movie was amazing. it made me laugh and it definitely made me cry. I thought it was going to be a funny movie but it turned out to have more than just comedy. the comedy in the movie actually is a relief i was amazed to find out that Perry wrote this  he is an amazing writing  actor and person. i think this movies displays all of these qualities. i love watching movies with black actors and sometime is find myself hating the movie even if its good because of all the thug b.s and just the trashy garbage that goes with it(and this gos for a lot of movies)but this movie was not like that. i hope everyone sees this movie and enjoys it!!!\tTyler Perry is a funny and talented man. The movie was both funny and touching. The acting was solid throughout. I am looking forward to \""Madeira's Family Reunion\"".Some people may think this movie denigrates religion  women  blacks  etc. I think the purpose of this movie was to do exactly the opposite and I think it succeeds for the most part. Perry does take material from other films  and I can see some similarities to \""The Klumps\"" with Eddie Murphy's characters and even \""Mama's Family\"" with Vicki Lawrence. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery and if done well  as in this case  I see no problem with it.Considering all of the over-hyped trash being churned out today  it is reassuring to see a clever playwright bring his characters to film and bring laughs and tears from the audience.\tthis is a really funny movie. the story centers around Helen  who seems to have the perfect life. she is married to Charles  a rich attorney  they have a big house  she has nice clothes  cars  and basically everything she's always wanted-- except a loving husband. when Helen finds herself being thrown out of her own home in favor of her husband's mistress  she goes to stay with her grandmother madea. madea has an opinion on everything and always keeps a gun in her purse. she encourages Helen to pull her life back together and helps her see that she is probably better off without Charles. madea is an especially lovable Archie bunker styled character that says and does unbelievably outrageous things. check out this movie and see some of Tyler perry's plays! they'll keep you in stitches!\tThis was a truly excellent movie. I was expecting it to be a lot like the play  however I was truly surprised! It was great! The storyline was written in such a manner that everyone could relate men and women alike. Kimberly Elise was excellent as Helen. And what a great performance (as usual) from Cicely Tyson. The relationship and chemistry between the two of them was remarkable. Tyler Perry was phenomenal. I truly enjoy all of his plays and this was a delight to see Madea on the big screen. What a great movie I laughed  I cried  I was overwhelmed with all types of emotions while watching. Did anyone notice the resemblance between Elise and Tyson? They could be related in real life.\t>>>>>spoilers<<<<<< this is a church movie - it got national release but this is a church movie geared to church going audiences. So  I'm not going to comment on any of that. The thing that disturbed me the most was the \""revenge\"" of Helen upon her completely helpless husband. The depths she had to sink to to do that to a completely helpless person without remorse is astonishing. She left him completely immobile unable to do anything for himself  including drink water for 2 days and when she got back did she feel remorse for what she had done or even slight dismay at her own behavior - no she then proceeds to dump him in a tub  which quite frankly if done the way she did it - he would have broken his neck. Then she virtually lets him think she is going to let him drown and then eats in front of him to punish him when he hasn't eaten for 2 days...she is somehow the heroine at this point? I'm sorry  he was a horrid jerk and abusive - but she topped him  she was depraved in her behavior and it alarms me that it is breezed over as if it meant nothing. She could have walked out on his abusive behind anytime she wanted to on her good two legs and fended for herself - he couldn't move enough to get himself a drink of water. Quite frankly the rest of the movie did not redeem that portion of it.That is my opinion - to which you are more than welcome to disagree but the \""message\"" in the movie to me was lost after that. Especially since she truly did not show the abject remorse she should have felt for what she did.\""I had a woman kiss me that way...didn't make her my wife\""\tThis is the first time I had seen Mr. Perry's work and was very impressed. I was happy to see the film contain a Christian message  however  I did feel it could have gone without some of the sexual content and definitely the drug usage portrayed. I was delighted to see that Mr. Perry was the author of some of the songs in the movie and will definitely purchase the sound track. The music was soulful and beautiful the way gospel music should be. I felt the presence of the Lord hearing the songs. Can't wait to crank them up in the mini van! I look forward to more of Mr. Perry's work in the future and am off to the video store right now to see what else \""Madea\"" has to offer.\tIt is fairly hard to transition a stage play to a movie and to use the caliber of actors that were employed in the making of this film  Mr. Perry has again given his audience something worth watching. Those who have followed Tyler Perry's stage plays through the years know that the first time he does something is a learning experience. It can only get better from there. The movie gave a lot of different scenarios and solutions for situations that just about anyone can understand. It has been a long time since the kids and I both wanted to watch the same movie at the same time. I am glad to see a film with such comedy that it can be enjoyed by the whole family.\tHow sad  yet it had some funny scenes! I felt so sorry for the wife  wondering how many times it happens this way...The Grandma had me in stitches! What she did at the house that her granddaughter was thrown out of  was perfect! I'd want to do the same thing! What the wife did to the husband near the end  I think he deserved it AND MORE! I was happy that the wife found someone who was decent and made her feel like she was a good person. I was worried close to the end tho  afraid that she was going to throw away a good thing. Shemar Moore is a real cutie! I watched it twice before I realized that Tyler Perry played 3 parts in the movie not just 2! At the end tho   all turned out well for all!"""
Donnie Darko (2001),"I can't see how in the world this thing came to be so overrated. First and foremost  everything about it seems hackneyed and recycled  it has an air of cheap 80s teeny thrillers about it. The plot is plain silly - a mishmash of tacky themes including UFOs  time-warp  bogeyman  and expectedly  teen angst. Now  supposedly  some such incredibly over-the-top plots may have made for some classic B-movies in the past. But even in terms of camp or trash value  this film is too square and has too large a budget to offer any entertainment. There's nothing genuinely funny or frightening in it  despite noticeable attempts. About a half way through I ended up yawning myself senseless and reaching for \stop\"". Perhaps the (fortunate) neglect of the themes involved during the 90s is accountable for this film's popularity amongst its generation of teens  to whom this may seem a novelty. It is possible that the poor quality of the story and dialogue is thus overlooked.\tDonnie Darko is the tale of a troubled boy trying to get through adolescence. In the first scene  you start by finding Donnie alone and asleep by the side of the road somewhere. After he gets home  you meet his family  who are rather bad-mouthed (at least the kids) but a normal American family nonetheless. You discover  after Donnie goes to bed  that he seems to be a chronic sleepwalker  and you watch as  after hearing some strange voice  follows it downstairs and out into the yard. A giant rabbit awaits him there  who  after saving him from a deadly disaster  tells him the world is going to end. Donnie realizes that he must find a way to save the world  do whatever his imaginary savior asks (Which may include some things you wouldn't want your child doing)  and romance the neighbor girl before that time comes  and before he is locked up for being the neighborhood \""nutter\"".\tAfter hearing such great things from everybody about this film  I can honestly say this is a film that I believe to have no redeeming qualities to it. I watched it numerous occasions and understood it  but it simply is horrible. I cannot fathom how so many people can think this film is a cult classic already. The acting is horrible  the story is weak and although it tries to be artistic  it does not accomplish it's goal. It is a pretentious film that has no merit. I always look for something good in a movie  but I could not find one good thing about this. It tries too hard and fails at everything.Please don't rent this  it will be a waste of your time and money.\tThis is my biggest sticking point with this movie. Was the subplot needed? I know it showed that Donnie could be dangerous and added to the mystery of Donnie's psychoses  but why was Swayze's character Jim crying at the end? Had he also been saved by Donnie's sacrifice and would now give up this wicked ways? Or was he crying for his own wickedness?I know it added another level to this film  and showed Frank's advice to burn down the house to be based on moral values thereby showing the Frank/Donnie relationship to be based on good not evil. But I still feel Swayze was a subplot too far. What do you guys think?\tI've heard so much about this \"" Wonderful   mind blowing masterpiece \"" . Interestingly enough most of the rave reviews of DONNIE DARKO came via this very website which goes against the grain of other reviewers . Roger Ebert only gave the movie two and a half stars while many other websites dedicated to film reviews claim this movie is confused and overrated . It should also be mentioned that if it's such a great   thought provoking piece of cinema then why did it miss out on so many nominations at the more prestigious film award ceremonies ? And don't say politics   an independent feature like IN THE BEDROOM didn't pick up any Oscars but that didn't stop it being nominated for severalDONNIE DARKO is by no means terrible but it is overrated . Dare I say it's a case of the emperors new clothes ? That is people are somewhat embarrassed upon seeing this film and not understanding it that they feel they must praise it in order to spare their supposed ignorance . Let me ask you this - What genre of film is this ? Everyone will give a slightly different answer I'm sure and if an audience is undecided about the genre then how can they decide what the ending is about ? And there is a quite serious plot hole involved in the story . Donnie sees a demonic rabbit called Frank throughout the movie who tells him at exactly what moment the world will end . Wormholes   time warps etc may actually exist in scientific reality as may the ending but the central plot does not since the whole movie rests on Frank or Donnie being able to see into the future and no scientist will claim there's any scientific basis for fortune telling . So you see it's not really about time travel   it's about mysticism   predestination and other superstitious mumbo jumbo which Richard Kelly is using to fool the audience . In effect this movie is one big cheat and most people have failed to notice this Having said that Richard Kelly does deserve some credit for making a movie that's not about car chases and explosions   this is a movie dealing with teen angst and the dark side of middle American small town values but Kelly has missed an opportunity to make the most of the potential . I know the film was released before the war on terror so there'd be little need to see news broadcasts on the fall out of the original Gulf war but from a pop culture point of view wouldn't this have been better set in the early 1990s when grunge culture was the rage instead of 1988 ? I mean what music best suits this movie's atmosphere ? Echo And The Bunnymen or Nirvana ? In fact if it had have set in the presidential elections of early 1990s this would have coincidentally tied in with what's going on in the world today with Saddam and Iraq getting a mention ! And wouldn't this movie be held up in superstitious awe now ? As it stands it's nowhere as clever as it thinks it is for the reasons outlined . Perhaps Mr Kelly started out on with two movies   one a high concept science fiction thriller and the other a low concept drama about a mentally ill teenager and decided to merge the two with not too successful results . Watching DOnnie Darko this was the gut feeling I got\tWith more than a touch of 'It's a Wonderful Life' and 'Harvey'  albeit with a decidedly odd twist  Richard Kelly's debut feature is a clever and thought-provoking piece of sci-fi.Donnie (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled teenager in therapy  a schizophrenic with imaginary friends - Frank the evil rabbit - and aspirations to travel through time. Add to this bodily projections carving out each person's path through life  a mad old lady always checking her mailbox  portals  Graham Greene's classic short story 'The Destroyers'  a creepy self-help guru (played by Patrick Swayze)  and a girl dance troupe  and gel it all together with an 80s score and that famous cover of 'Mad World'  and you have a recipe for success.But does it work? From the strange opening premise  as destruction comes to the Darko house in the form of a fallen jet engine  through to the bleak and haunting finale  it's a valiant try  but for all it's good points  it feels a little sterile and undeveloped.Familiar faces such as Katharine Ross (The Graduate)  Mary O'Donnell (Dances With Wolves)  Noah Wyle (ER)  and Drew Barrymore add interest  but the focus is strictly on Donnie himself  and he ultimately leaves us baffled.\t'Donnie Darko' has a reputation for being a seriously strange film; but in some ways  it's undeserved. This is not just to say that it is fundamentally very conventional compared with the work of the likes of Bunel; it's actually far coherent than many mainstream science fiction thrillers (for example  'Open My Eyes'  or it's American remake  'Vanilla Sky'  which where simply praised for their \""dazzling\"" plots); or horror films like the 'Ring' cycle. My guess is that audiences were thrown primarily because of the expectations of genre; supernatural  surreal happenings are simply not supposed to appear in what is partly a teen movie  and partly a suburban satire. As a straight film  'Donnie Darko' isn't bad: all the sympathetic characters are unnaturally beautiful  of course  and there are the customary easy pops at educational behaviourists (to a Briton  this recurrent aspect of American teen movies is very strange  can they really be so prevalent to deserve this amount of attention?); but there's some nice dark comedy  and the acting and editing are generally of a high standard. It even manages to possess a good soundtrack using 1980s songs (in my opinion  quite an achievement in itself!). As science fiction  on the other hand  it bears some resemblance to Douglas Copeland's book  'Girlfriend in a Coma' (and indeed  makes much more sense than that book did). What it doesn't give us is any indication of why the events we see should happen to its hero; the film may be sensible  but it's also essentially meaningless. Nonetheless  it's intelligently made  distinctive  and not really that confusing  providing you leave your preconceptions at the cinema door.\tThis film had a profound experience on my life  especially as before watching this film i could be categorised as a bruckhiemer  slow-motion action film nut. Watching films for explosions never caring less what the story was.then i had the urge to watch Donnie darko. The main picture of frank was like an intense calling to me  so i gave it a shotand what a shot it was! It is without a doubt the best cinema experience i have ever had. Now let me clear this up  it is not the best film i have ever seen(pretty close though) but the best cinema experience. The perfect musical score running through the speakers  giving me goosebumps at certain points of the film. getting this films on DVD was good  but seeing this film in cinema just seems divine. There is probably enough comments on her telling you how good the film is so let me just say they are right. It is not a film for everyone  some will hate it  some will love it (like that stupid crap mar-mite). For some the aspect of this film is so profoundly confusing that i have spent many days explaining it to others.But the film is confusing  as it is supposed to be  this is not a clear cut Hollywood blockbuster  direct line throughout the film  this is supposed to make you think  feel  it will make you use a range of emotions in such a short period of time. Watching this film in the cinema changed my views on films and i will never have the same experience as i did with this film. Richard Kelly  you bow to no-one!\tDonnie Darko is a political film. When a plane crashes into a building it is not a random act of god  but there has to be other forces at work  the reason the film is set in the 1980's is that's when bush came to power  and the end of the world was set in motion. 'vote Dukasas' not bush (with hindsight) The world has been brain washed by TV  Donnie's dad was also falling into hypnotic states in front of the TV  Donnie is the supper hero who has been chosen by Frank to create a revolution and set things right  symbolised by the Grame Green book the destroyers.He wants to rip the present world apart and create a new order. perhaps the reason the film is so obscure is that it wouldn't sit easily on the west's shoulders that the hero of the film is the destroyer (aka freedom fighter/terrorist)yet the freedom fighter is him self delusional  perhaps he is confused by all the lies that the position's use to cover there own backs  to appear as pillar of society types  sublimest by Jim Cunningham  to conclude I think that the action taken by Donnie wasn't ideal  he died to make things better  but there was still a lot of victims left over by what he done  IE his family  but the alternative was worse. There were no winners\tMost people need to see the movie twice to like it  and three times to get it. The best part of the movie is the 2 hour conversation afterwards. If you like movies that make you think about society  politics  religion  science  etc. then you will love this movie. The reason why this film is so great is that the topics are not blatantly portrayed  everything is hidden and has multiple meanings. every scene  every line  every image is filled with metaphors  similes  symbolisms  etc. it's poetry on film. definitely a must see  everybody that i've recommend it to has loved it  well actually disliked it initially then loved it after we talked about it.\tAnd I don't understand the point of the movie. someone bother to explain? I mean so he dies from the plane crash in the beginning and the whole movie was just a dream  hence the song at the end. Thats what I'm getting out of it.Because timeline thing just wouldn't make any sense. Cuz then the sister wouldn't have her show. Jim Cunningham would not be exposed. Frannk would never exist.Am i making any sense here?Other than that is there an accepted logic for this movie. Like something that is widely believed.Thanks!\tI first saw Donnie Darko after hearing about it from my sister-in-law. My wife and I subsequently went out and bought the Director's Cut DVD because the theatrical version was so good  but a bit lacking in info. The Director's Cut ties up some of the loose ends in the theatrical version  and leaves you with even more wonder and love for this movie. Trying to describe this movie is quite difficult  but suffice it to say that it's a dark  satirical look at today's society  growing up  and mind games all rolled into one little movie.If you like movies that get your mind racing then this movie is for you!\tThis movie was so amazing. I really loved it  the only character I disliked being Drew Barrymore's. Thrilling at parts and hilarious at others  it's one of those rare black comedy/romance/psychological thrillers that I was hooked on from beginning to end. Watch this as long as you won't be offended by quite strong language or permanently scarred by a man in a bunny suit. I've seen it too many times to count  and each time I'm surprised by the new depth I discover. Levels of story and characters keep on emerging  making this one of those movies you won't get bored of after seeing it again and again. Everything comes together in the end  or it will if you've followed everything closely up till that point. This film covers everything from child pornography to the Smurfs. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a fantastic performance as Donnie Darko  a guy with serious problems  including a man dressed in a pink bunny suit and insect mask named Frank whom only he can see. Maggie Gyllenhaal is playing her real-life role as his sister. Jena Malone is awesome in her role as Donnie's love interest  a tough job for anyone. Drew Barrymore is all right  but I got the feeling that she was only there to give the film real star-power; her character was needlessly put in in some scenes. However  one finds him- or herself involved in the characters' lives  from Donnie's troubled mind to his mother's lack of commitment to Sparkle Motion. It's not a movie for the faint of heart or tolerance to raunchy language and dialog. Even when this movie is making fun of things  like evangelists  it is giving its opinions and thoughts. This is NOT a movie in which you can drift off  not pay attention  or think of as a light-hearted farce. Don't be fooled by anything you may have heard about this being for laughs; sure  it's funny at parts  but that isn't what it's about. \""Donnie Darko\"" is a new turn on emotional distress in adolescents  time travel  and psychiatry. I don't even pretend to fully comprehend the true meaning of this movie. Maybe I'm taking it too seriously  but I find it more likely that I just don't understand what was and is happening in the minds of the people who made this movie or in the minds of people who actually know what this means. I've been blown away by other movies  but this one made me think more than anything. Try not to be too skeptical about the views in this movie  and don't be saddened by the surprising deaths. I can't think of another movie that stirred me as much as this one. See it  because even if it doesn't affect you as it did me  it will provide a couple hours of enjoyment.\tThe majority of films i tend to watch are for the sole purpose of entertainment   but however when the magic of that film stays with long after the film has finished then it has indeed served its purpose . Donnie Darko is a film that does that for me   this film drew me into a world where nothing is what it seems like at all   we are taken on journey where i believe we experience the chaos theory and we are told that everything that we do has a consequence . The film it-self has a sense of humour but also retains that certain level of being creepy . With a twist that is added on to every level of the film up to the climax leaving people a little dazed and confused . This film is certainly not one to view just for entertainment purposes as it will probably get you thinking a lot and it is not for people with a short attention span as you have to follow it very carefully . However i defiantly recommend this film   add this to your films to watch before i die list .\tDonnie Darko is  like Mullholland Drive  Blue Velvet and others before  a personal movie. Kelly has provided his viewers with a canvas open to their own interpretation. My personal interpretation runs along the lines of Donnie functioning as the worlds saviour  realigning the balance between the Tangent universes. The first part of the film sees Donnie fighting against the forces of the world he feels threatens him. His struggle manifests itself in his neurosis and visions of Frank. In this part of the movie Roberta Sparrow's declaration that we all die alone is negative to Donnie. However as things become clearer to him (and more confusing to us)he realises that he has to die alone  he has to die to save Gretchen and put things back the way they should be. The final part of the film focuses on Donnies acceptance of this. Frank must die in order to free Donnie who in turn saves Gretchen. Donnie declares 'Our Saviour' after Gretchen's death and heads home to sacrifice himself to rectify the traumatic events. The films ending poses the question to us that can one death to save others be justified? The personal nature of the movie creates many question and an equal number of interpretations. Flaws in its analysis are impossible to avoid but that is the best part of this cult classic.\tWe all know the story of the teenager full of angst; it's an old tale. But this movie takes the teenager and put him into a new situation\u0085. The end of the world! Seriously though  the atmosphere of this movie hits you and keeps attached throughout the whole film. The story line is thought provoking and quite deep; it leaves quite a lot of the story open for the viewer to view it in their own way (intentional or not..). This has lead to most people saying that  to get the real idea of 'Donnie Darko' you should watch it at least twice. Well in my opinion there is no need  I understood most of the story in the first viewing. The only problem being that with misunderstanding of the story this film could be discarded as rubbish. (I have also been told that this film is stupid because it makes no sense  this was by the same person who said exactly the same about the less confusing matrix\u0085?) The film is about a kid (conveniently named Donnie Darko) who has been having 'emotional problems' for some time. This has lead Donnie to be seeing a therapist about it  this seems has no effect on his problems. Donnie has been having visions of this 6 feet tall rabbit  called frank. The first time we encounter Frank we discover that the world will end in 28 days  6 hours  42 minutes and 12 seconds.So we follow Donnie for the next 28 days  with his development on the end of the world. With more encounters with Frank (don't worry it all becomes clear close to the end) and characters such as 'Grandma Death'  Donnie's teachers  friends and family all add to Donnie's development and his realisation that  with fate  we all die alone. As you can probably guess this is no 'sexy cheerleader  oh my God she is taking them off' teen movie but a deep thought provoking film about alienation and the meaning of life.Not that this film is perfect it has some flaws. I felt that his dreams  full of special effects seemed to go on a bit too long. I got the point of Frank after a while; I didn't need to know that Donnie couldn't stab him because of a force field. The only things I can find wrong are tiny pathetic things like that  so no major problems.I wouldn't advise people to go and see this if you are too lazy (or stupid) to think about what is happening. Also if you enjoy the mindless Hollywood trash then this is not the movie for you. But for all the people who are willing to go and watch a thinking persons movie then  this is for you! So go and watch it now you thinkers.\tWhat is Donnie Darko all about  I mean really? I don't know and if anyone tells you they do they're a bastard liar because its one of those head-scratching setups designed to generate speculative musing on the film's thematic preoccupations. Broadly  said themes are philosophical and far reaching - the nature of being  place in the universe type questions  in other words impossible to satisfactorily resolve to any degree and if thats the kind of fantasy that makes you neck a bottle of Stolie and then forcefully cups your genitals then Darko is probably one of the best films of its type ever conceived  destined to be mulled over and picked apart for a long time  unless that is you've made the mistake of watching the idiot's guide  sorry Directors Cut that extracts all the delicious ambiguity and joins all the dots for lazy viewers. So there you have it - funny  touching  intelligently scripted  great soundtrack  emotionally stimulating  Swayze getting hauled in for child pornography - everything many films promise but don't deliver  all on the same bill! Textbook.\tI personally loved this movie. It is one of those movies that will make you think while watching it  and that shows some signs of a intelligent movie.It is not for those who are very narrow minded. It is a very confusing tale relating with a troubled teenager trying to escape the pain of escaping his inner pain all dealing with the subject of time travel.It is not a very intense movie for being rate \""R\"" there is brief violence only one real scene  some language containg some f words and the drug content is very mild. It is not very younger children not much for the sake of \""rating\"" but for the themes and the story itself which very hard to follow. Many people will not understand until watching it about 2-4 times. I had to watch it twice to really get it.all in all this is a piece of movie-making genius  and i believe is very underrated. I believe this was an excellent movie and i give it a 9.5 out of 10\tA delusional high school student (Jake Gyllenhaal) by the name of Donnie Darko has visions by a mysterious figure (James Duval). The mysterious figure dressed as a rabbit is telling Donnie eerie visions of the past and future. This suburban teen has to come face to face with his dark destiny.Directed by first-time filmmaker:Richard Kelly made an excitingly original  edgy  psychological  sci-fi/thriller with an dark sense of humor. Gyllenhall is excellent in the film. The film has an terrific supporting cast including:Jena Maline  Drew Barrymore  Mary Mc Donnell  Katherine Ross  Maggie Gyllenhaal  Holmes Osborne  Daveigh Chase  Patrick Swayze  Beth Grant and Noah Wyle. This independent film was well received but it turned into a box office flop. The film become a major cult hit on DVD that has a huge following.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an entertaining commentary track by the director and actor:Gyllenhall. DVD also has another commentary track by the cast and crew. DVD also has Deleted/Extended Scenes with optional director's commentary  music video. original theatrical trailer  t.v. spots  hidden features and more.The Director's Cut DVD has an terrific anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an excellent-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an new commentary track by filmmakers:Richard Kelly and fan of the film-Kevin Smith (Clecks  Chasing Amy  Dogma). Disc Two has an production diary with optional commentary by the director of photography:Steven Poster (Dead & Buried)  a hilarious Donnie Darko fan #1  featurettes and the theatrical trailer for the director's cut. Some will love this Director's Cut more than the Original Theatrical Version. So  judge it for yourself. This is one of the most unique and underrated films of 2001. Barrymore is also one of the executive producers of the film. Nicely photographed by Steven Poster. The film has a terrific remake of a Tears for Fears song-Mad World by Gary Jules. Do not miss this. Written by the director. Panavision. (**** \u00bd/***** for both versions).\tTHIS IS ONLY FOR THOSE WHO HAS SEEN THE MOVIE ALREADY... This movies to me sums up to stupidity. Some man in a rabbit costume comes to a probably mentally ill teen and says the world will end. At the end of the movie I think the storywriter theorizes that the world would not have ended if the teen died. In between this there is a collection of profanity  a boy doing pervert acts in the presence of a psychologist  time-travel chit-chats  a chick getting nailed  a teen challenging his teachers  a chick getting teased  some girl going to Harvard  some psychologist have the hots for Mr. Roger and classifying the world as either fear and love. You also need to watch the movie a couple of time to get the meaning of certain things. I personally think you do not need an all-star cast to make a movie like this. All-star cast require good scripts or its not worth the cost and production time."""
Downfall (2004),"I have been studying about Hitler and the Third Reich since High School and have read everything I could get my hands on. I have also traveled to visit the sites shown in the movie. I also read a review in the IMDb which said the lead actor had heard and practiced Hitler's accent. Usually when you watch movies about history  the writers want to make the movie interesting not accurate. The first thing I look for is the accuracy of the equipment and uniforms and I was most impressed. I found out later the movie company had excellent technical advisor's.What really left a profound impression on me was how some of the people in the movie would prefer death over surrender. The idea of loyalty  honor  and duty to country was outstanding--like the motto of the SS  \My Honor is Loyalty\"" or a motto like  \""Death before Dishonor\"". I was so impressed by this that I wanted to climb into the screen and go back in time to be able to be with people like this. I really wished I was back in the Third Reach!\tWho says the Germans have no humour? They are just more subtle  and often their wit is easily mistaken for grave earnestness. An example might be the German lady who approached an invading American general among the ruins of Berlin in 1945 with the words: \""If only you Americans had stayed out  none of this would have happened\"". That must have been a joke  right?But now  all subtlety set aside  Hirschbeigel has chosen to go all out with an unmistaken farce in \""Der Untergang\""  about the last days of Adolf Hitler. Be prepared for side-splitting fun: two hours of Nazis suffering from the consequences of their own crimes. Goebbels' wife popping cyanide pills into her five sleeping children (a gem)  a commander exploding hand grenades under his unsuspecting wife's dinner table while soup is being poured  and Hitler himself ... well  Groucho Marx  Charlie Chaplin  and Jim Carrey spring to mind as runners-up  but Adolf takes the cake. What a comedian! I laughed myself silly.Apart from that  Hirschbeigel's movie is well-acted and masterly executed. Besides obvious slapstick (Germans having their brains blown out)  the film also offers more refined jokes  such as the smoking Germans who start out by smoking outside Hitler's bunker in gentle deference to their non-smoking Fuehrer  and end up puffing away right outside his door  as his madness soars.Here comes the SPOILER: Hitler dies in the end.Definitely worth seeing!PS! If you want more material on German comedy I can recommend chapter VIII of Jerome K. Jerome's \""Three Men in a Boat\""  on Professor Slossenn Bosschen's great German comic song.\tWhen we think of World War II  we think of epic battles and storming beaches. There was the naval battles in the Pacific and the land warfare in Europe. One of the most infamous people of WWII was Adolf Hitler  a man that brainwashed an entire nation into believing in his cause. Considered one of the most powerful evil geniuses in history  his final days were not so cunning. The last days of Adolf Hitler can now be seen.In Oliver Hirschbiegel's epic Downfall (USA title)  we see the end of WWII for the German's. Berlin is surrounded and Hitler (Bruno Ganz) is running out of options fast. He and his staff of experienced commanders are now faced with a huge decision  stay in Berlin and try to fight off the Russian's  or surrender and try to make a peace treaty. Hitler will have no talk of surrender  for he would rather commit suicide than see his country beg for mercy. His newly acquired secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) is caught up in the mess of things. The Russian's are closing in on the city and the morale is fading fast amongst Hitler's commanders.In the streets  there are those who are loyal to the Nazi party and Hitler's reign. They fight till they have no bullets left and then end their life. There are those who hide in the ruins of the once prosperous city. Hitler and all of his cabinet are stationed underground to avoid any bombings from the invaders. It is here that the commands are sent out and the roots of treason are mended. One by one some of Hitler's 'top dogs' start to open negotiations with the US  England  and Russia  issuing the surrender of Germany due to Hitler's incapacity to continue his rule. Upon hearing the news of his commander's treachery  the Fuhrer is enraged  wanting them arrested and executed. Soon  everyone in the bunker is feeling anxious of Hitler's next move.Hirschbiegel's film is a masterpiece  delivering on many levels. What is shown on film is a powerful portrait of one of the most sinister men to walk the earth. He is scene as the Fuhrer  a man who with order can kill hundreds and thousands of innocent people...because he can. Then there is the side people don't see  the real Adolf Hitler. This is what Traudl sees and what Eva Braun has come to love in him. His spirit almost broken  Hitler looks as if he has aged way beyond his years. Ganz is brilliant as the Fuhrer and gives him human qualities when he is usually looked at as a monster.Downfall is a stunning account of the last days in Adolf Hitler's bunker. The final battles between the Russian's and the German's are coming to an end. This is the downfall of the Nazi Regime  and the entire globe is waiting for the biggest war ever to come to an end...\tDownfall is a great film. It follows the last few days of Hitler  he has turned into a crazy old beast (not that he was the sanest of creatures beforehand). He now no longer cares what happens to the Germans and his regime is falling apart as he makes ridiculous military decisions that are doomed to fail. Goebbels  Hitler's Minister of Propaganda  is played by an scary looking man  he has very angular features. The person I ended up hating the most out of this film though wasn't Hitler  but Goebbel's wife who was so into National Socialism that she took to her bed saying that without National Socialism there was no future. She then proceeded to murder all six of her children so that they wouldn't grow up in a world without Nazis. Psycho. You almost  I said almost  feel sorry for Hitler in places. His wife was also a weirdo  blindly following his orders \""you're the Fuhrer\"" she tells him even when her pregnant sister's husband is sentenced to death because it is Hitler's will. The scenes of a war-torn  ruined Berlin were excellent  giving a feeling of a real war zone. I really enjoyed this movie because I taught me a lot about what happened in the last days  how Hitler died and why his body wasn't found; how the whole regime came crumbling down.\tI call this the \""Passion of the Anti-Christ\"" because there are  although strained  similarities in how this movie effect me.This movie is about a character from history that is larger than history. Hitler has become a symbol of evil  and certainly I am not the first person to place Adolf Hitler as the ultimate nemesis anti-Christ. But this is the surface of this movie.Underneath  this movie is about the German people. The ability of one man to take advantage of the post-WWI trauma of a culture and manipulate it until the lines of compassion and inhumanity become blurred. Conformity and hypocrisy were not the only traits of the German people.I have always been unable to create a scenario in which I could see how anyone could justify Hilter's world as a good thing. Even with the fear of the power of the Nazi party  the end of war should have given those with fear of the government should have been emboldened.But this portrayal creates a very real world. There were those in Hitler's inner circle who were fanatical followers  but that was not true of everyone. What we do see is a culture who in its last days floundered to grasp onto any hope-- hope to keep out the Russians  hope to keep the national pride that Hitler brought them from the ashes of a great depression  and the hope that the continued blind faith they gave to the \""Fuhrer\"" would take them through.It was amazing that even in the last hours of Hitler's life the power he commanded. Even in his seemingly \""normal\"" understated life those closest to him worshiped him.In his \""work life \"" generals would bicker and plead with their leader on the last moments to end the insanity  but never once disobeyed an order  even when it was to submit themselves to be shot.Just like \""the Passion \"" there is a message there that is important to us as humans. It is a warning about the tragedy of man and our ability to give our free will up in exchange for group think. It is also a message that evil is only the face of the movement  and that the people behind the mask are just like you and me.The fact that anyone has the potential to be evil. Even worse  that we can all delude ourselves that the horror within can easily be confused for passion  loyalty  and good.It is a hard movie to watch  because it is so well done that it is easy to look past the iconic mustache  swastikas and clicking heels and look at a people much like ourselves and think \""There but by the grace of God go I.\""\tI must admit I wasn't intimate friends with the guy  but drawing from history I can not imagine a much different Hitler than the one portrayed by Bruno Ganz. He is at times terrifying  stubborn  and ruthless  while at other times he is... well... much the same. Ganz also manages to capture the charisma that drew so many close to this dangerous man. The rest of the cast was spot on as well  as the sense of urgency in the ranks of the Nazi Party reaches fever pitch. Any Neo-Nazi would be well served to view this tale of their furor at his most feeble and deranged time  as they might begin to question why they follow such a leader.\t\""Downfall\"" takes you into Hitler's bunker during the fall of the third Reich and the last ten days of the battle for Berlin. This historical docudrama spends its time examining one of history's most enigmatic and inscrutable dictators as he descend into paranoia to the bewilderment of his inner circle and  in particular  one young woman stenographer who  in real life  survived the war and published her memoirs providing one of the few historical records of that time and place. The film is well done as a stand alone dramatic presentation. However  it excels as an historical drama by providing insights into Hitler's last days; something never dealt with in such detail before in film. An engrossing 2.5 hour watch with a splendid performance by Bruno Ganz as Hitler. Who better to make such a film than the Germans? Bravo. (B+)\tI just saw this on DVD. As a WWII film buff  I found this film interesting from a historical perspective. Certainly the best and most dramatic depiction of the fall of Berlin that I've seen. But as a \""movie \"" I found it lacking. There is no central POV; we're introduced to many characters  some of whom we recognize by sight (Goering and Goebbles have become caricatures over time)while others are unknown and their roles are never really explained. A friend is currently reading a book called HITLER'S INNER CIRCLE. Perhaps if I'd read that before seeing the film I may have had a better understanding of who all the personalities were. Rather than focusing solely on the bunker goings-on this film takes us to the streets of greater Berlin where we see generals making futile last stands and encounter roving bands of vigilantes executing anyone trying to flee the chaos and destruction. While these scenes are interesting  they take us away from the central story  which is Hitler and his main underlings' last stand. I felt drained at the end of this film. Nobody to cheer for  nobody to feel sympathy for. The people depicted were the architects of the greatest mass murder and sheer carnage the world has ever seen so they are unable to generate any emotion in the viewer. The only question I had at the end was why couldn't these psychos  murderers  and criminals have committed suicide a decade earlier?\tLike all War films that surround World War II taken from Hitler's side they all often have the knack of showing Hitler on rare  unintended positive side. Der Untergang has this problem. For the person who was slaughtered millions of innocent people  how can we see him doing things such as padding through a young boy's hair or putting a nervous secretary at ease with a joke? Luckily this is sort of kept under control with screenwriter Bernd Eichinger  who basically delivers that idea that even the worst of the Nazis were still human at heart  regardless of their intentions. The more interesting parts of the film is seeing Hitler not just picking out the Jews  but him and his cohorts going from picking out everyone  even to random Berliners who were considered traitors in Hitler's eyes. This film basically does delve in the fact that Hitler was long gone mad in his last final days.The film as a whole on the other hand..it's well..slow and scattered. You can even tell at times that it was glued together from a multitude of historical sources. Making some sequences long and over-done  allowing it to drag  even if Traudl Junge has an interesting story (even if it was re-stated before in the documentary \""Hitler's Secretary\"".)  and the filmmakers seem to lack the drama of what was going on with the specific people which allowed them to get all caught up in what was happening.Overall Downfall succeeds even if does seem like it could have use some re-organizing  and better sense of pace. It's still well worth a watch.8 / 10.\tThis film is one of the best films i have ever seen!!! The sheer emotion of it all left me speechless and in awe. Having read some of the other reviews  and agreeing with many of the comments i wish to add just a couple of points that floored me....1] the sound  particularly of the artillery was deafening and served to me the idea of just how terrifying war is. 2] the cinematography is fantastic  particularly of the war torn streets showing the desperation and depravity. After seeing this movie with a friend we both left the cinema without a word and went home  it wasn't until a few hours later after reflection that i could even begin to discuss the impact. If you liked this film read Bernhard Schlink's 'The Reader'.\tThe most boring movie ever! I was so sorry that I didn't leave the cinema during the break when I went to this movie. I was just waiting the whole movie for something interesting or amusing to happen  what never happened. Maybe a good moral or something could have made up for that  but that also was something the movie lacked. Plot line of the movie; a few bombs  a few sick and crazy Hitler fans  a bunch of people who didn't dare to speak up to Hitler and Hitler being boring and disturbed. Boring dialogs and even 'so-called-dramatic-events' came off pretty lame.The only people who like this movie are probably the ones who cannot look back on WO II rationally and therefore think every movie about WO II/ Hitler is great/artistic. Well  this one sure isn't.\tHitler. A name most infamous and hated by many. A man who is considered the epitome of evil and hate. The \""Downfall\"" of Hitler  and what actually took place in the bunker those last days  even though it may have been show in History  has never been explained in such detail. Downfall was a terrific film. The precision of the performances  most notably by Ganz was so true to the reality that was World War 2. It is a true eye opener to what it may have been like. The story is told from the perspective of Frau Junge  a young secretary for Hitler who finds herself in a situation that she was never get out of. Trapped in the world of propaganda  and working for the man who was key to mass murder of 6 million Jews.The cinematography and use of camera angles was amazing. Moving and changing to adjust mood and space. Hitler grows from a figure of power  to a pitiful man who is mad with jealously  anger and hate for anyone and everyone. The acting was bar none. It was like history was playing out for you. Bruno Ganz is an amazing actor. I can't imagine how difficult it would be to portray such a man to the perfection Ganz performed. Eva Braun was a particularly interesting character. Her dysfunctional manner and inability to find the appropriateness in any situation was unsettling. I will hand to to the cast and crew of Downfall  you sent shivers down my spine. The brutish  cruel and rather sad life od Adolf Hitler  and the blinded dedication he was shown by his Nationalist-Socialist followers was so disturbing. If there is one criticism of the film  it would have to be the realism of it all. It was too real! This really isn't a criticism at all. It only emphasizes my point that this film was of the highest quality.The Teutonic and harsh manner of the German was amazing. Scenes of despair and utter loss  yet the ability to get up and move on for the \""sake\"" of National-Socialism. The idea was terrifying that people could be such blind followers. To be sucked into entirely and be pleased with the idea of murder  racism and anger. Downfall is not to be missed. If you do not wish to delve into intellectual discussion and would rather a film like \""Bring it On Again\""  then perhaps this is not for you. This movie is for thinkers.I wouldn't call it enjoyable  but it certainly is addictive. It is a great movie.\tBerlin April 1945: The Red Army has launched it's last great offensive of the Second World War with a massive armored and infantry assault on the German capital. Deep inside a bunker underneath the German Reichstag is the German Fhurer Adolf Hitler  Bruno Ganz and his general staff conducting the last desperate defense of the city but time is quickly running out with even the most fanatical and optimistic of them  with the exception of Hitler  know that the end is near and are looking to somehow escape from this hell on earth or at least negotiate a surrender with the attacking Soviets forces. It's these historic days during the spring of 1945 that are covered in the movie \""Downfall\"".Explosive and blood-splattering film with an Acdemy Award caliber performance by Bruno Ganz as the German leader Adolf Hitler as his nation is being clobbered with daily and nightly one thousand plane bombing raids from the air and with millions of allied troops  on two fronts swarming across it's borders on land putting an end to the Third Reich that he brought into power in Germany back in 1933. The total pandemonium that struck that city is realistically and graphically depicted in the movie that's based on the memories of Hitler's personal secretary Traudl Junge  Alexandra Maria Lara  who was working for him in that capacity since 1942.One of the best movies about Hitler ever made has him shown in a very different light then the usual portrayals that were used to seeing him in the scores of films made about Hitler  and WWII  over the years. Wild threatening and hysterical towards his generals when things aren't going right  which in the movie was almost all the time  Hitler showed his \""human side\"" when it came to his personal staff. Insisting that they leave the city before it fell to the dreaded Red Army and also being grateful to them when they refuse and wanted to stay  and kill themselves  along with him when the end came.There's a great scene in the bunker when Hitler realizes that the \""great offensive\"" that he expected by German General Steiner's 9th Army  to smash the Soviets and throw them out of Berlin  never materialized because he  Steiner  didn't have the men and tanks to do the job. Completely losing it and letting his generals have it Hitler at last finally realized  with the later defection of his two top honchos SS leader Himmler & second in command Goering  that the war was lost. Hitler then instead of trying to escape from the doomed city decided to stay at his post  as the German Chief of State  until it's defense was no longer possible then end it all by putting a bullet in his head.Terrifying scenes with blood and guts and body parts flying in all directions with even the Germans themselves  the Army and Nazi Gestapo  shooting hundreds of German soldiers and civilians who were trying to flee the city  to save their lives  for disobeying orders and not standing and fighting to the last man and woman like their Fhurer ordered them to.With all the horrors in the movies \""Downfall\"" the one that struck me most  even though it was very minor compared to the rest of the carnage in the film  was the murder by the Nazi Misnister of Propaganda Joseph Gobbels and his wife Magda  Ulrich Matters & Corinna Harfouch  of their six young children by poisoning them as they were asleep. Determined to both kill themselves the Gobbels' didn't even want their children to survive the war saying that there's no reason for them to live in a world without National Socialism or their \""beloved Fhurer\"" Adolf Hitler or uncle Adolf as he was efficiently called by them. the movie \""Downfall\"" showed more then anything else how right the Union Civil War General Sherman was in his famous statement \""War is Hell\"".\tThe whole story of Hitler's downfall is told through the eyes of his former secretary Traudl Junge. It starts with her selection  and while another woman born and raised in Berlin is dismissed in an instant  she is chosen because of her Bavarian background (Hitler was born in Austria  not far from Bavaria). She died in 2002 and in the documentary I'm toten Winkel - Hitlers Sekret\u00e4rin / Blind Spot - Hitler's Secretary she is interviewed and the script of Der Untergang / Downfall is also based on that interview. The problem I have with her is that I just can not believe her naivety. Yes  she admits in the end of Der Untergang (taken from that documentary) that she should have known better. But I personally still believe that she knew better but went along and this movie and the documentary suggest there are some people defending or at least believing her.This is the most expensive German production ever made and it shows. Especially the sound and sound editing works impressive as we have the bombing and fighting always going on in the foreground or background. Every time a person considers the bunker as an ordinary place to live  a sound (loud or soft) can be heard. The confined space within the bunker is also what makes this work with the opportunity to make shots of the long central hall where a lot of drama can be viewed with a distant camera-eye. By letting the viewer spend such amount of time in the bunker the restrictions and drama becomes only clearer. The war outside is used to create the contrast with the relative tranquility within and to show the difference between the suffering of the people and the madman inside that never once cared for them in the end. But the action outside is too sketchy  most characters are anonymous so it makes it hard to identify with any of them. This isn't on the level of Saving Private Ryan  by now the standard for war movies.With Hirschbiegel's background as TV-man this is a well made documentary dressed as fiction  but that alone does not make cinema. There are a couple of scenes that reach that level: Speer shown in the end in front of one of his own neo-classical buildings  a boy walks from a battle scene and we hear gunfire only to find out seconds later it is the typewriter of the secretary  the readings of the letters of the females intertwined with the suicidal deaths of a male and female SS-soldier.The fall of empires never comes unexpectedly  and although such regimes do not disappear in an instant  they ultimately dissolve in a few days. As the end nears  Hitler is shown increasingly as an idiot losing all sense for reality and giving random orders  appointments  and still decorating soldiers. The only thing important to him is dog-like loyalty. From his loyal followers we see a range of reactions: From the true believer Goebbels  sacrificing his whole family and his own forces  to the pragmatic Himmler  the loyal (but not to every price) Speer and the human Schenck.Hitler did what the Germans demanded from him. He was a simple man with a humble background and limited capabilities who luckily failed in what he tried to accomplish. He saw Stalin as more ruthless  which to an extent is historically true  although their atrocities are of the same proportions.This movie stays close to the known facts  and is therefore interesting as a history lesson. But for those familiar with all facts this is only an annotation  and for those not familiar it lacks a proper introduction in all the characters. Unfortunately it may send the wrong message: showing Hitler (perfectly acted by Bruno Ganz) as just a human being (soft spoken  animal lover and a vegetarian  all true by the way) it may be an attractive document for neo-Nazis too. So  to what end was this made  because there could be a somewhat stronger message like Hirschbiegel's Das Experiment has.\tThrough the decades since the end of World War 2  we've come to regard Hitler and the Third Reich as somewhat of a confusing question mark in history: how could this have happened? This movie  perhaps more than any other  tries to answer that question by presenting a unique view of the last days of the Third Reich. It explores the question of why people can be led so easily into hell and the madness of self-destruction by one man  and one idea. The bunker simply serves as a convenient setting to examine this question: after all  it's only at the end  with death imminent  with time for self-reflection  that we can get a really convincing picture of the motives and thinking of those who were involved. \""Why?\"": I think that's the central question of this movie. No more  no less. And because of that I think it's one of the most important movies that have been made in a long time  maybe ever.\tVery interesting and factual account of the last days of the Third Reich  Bruno Ganz is magnificent as the Fuhrer and all the other actors are top notch. I am a WW2 buff and this movie comes very close to the actual events that occurred during those last dark days in the Berlin bunker. Seen thru the eyes of Traudl Junge  (the real Traudl Junge has a scene at the opening and close of the movie) Hitler's secretary during the last 2 1/2 years of the Reich  we get to see first hand accounts of Hitler's world crashing down around him. The film takes us thru all the events happening in the bunker including Magda Goebbels poisoning her 6 children and Hitler's last minute marriage to Eva Braun. This film is a brilliant piece of work and a must see for anyone interested in WW2.\t'Please  retain your faith in the final victory! If you lead us  we will follow!' By the time these words are spoken to Adolf Hitler it is far too late for him to be able to reassure the hysteric woman who said them. He knows  as all his Generals know  that World War II is over. And Germany has lost. However  as his mental stability declines Hitler will forget this and try  once again  to win. Moving forces that exist only on his map and calling in strikes by planes that were destroyed months earlier  Hitler fights until his last to protect the crumbled remains of what was once his evil empire. He pores over models that represent the new cities he believes he will build  and no one has the courage to tell him that his Aryan Xanadu will never exist as anything but these models.This is \""Der Untergang (The Downfall)\"". The film is inspired by the memoirs of Traudl Junge  Hitler's last secretary and oblivious follower. Traudl stands at the Fuhrer's side and refuses to move despite lacking all knowledge of him  even his Holocaust. The confused young woman watches in horror as Hitler's Generals turn their backs on him  and she weeps when she finds the remains of her leader's brains scattered across a wall following a fateful gun shot.\""Downfall\"" has a tricky goal: to show the human side of Hitler. No  it's not about making you sympathize with him. It's about showing that he wasn't some superhuman. Bruno Ganz's performance as Hitler  one of the towering performances in cinema history  exposes faults in the Fuhrer. Physically  his hands twitch uncontrollably and his back is hunched as if burdened with a massive load of shame and humiliation. Mentally  he rants about wanting to speak to soldiers he knows are dead and he fabricate stories about Nazi forces hiding in Prussia  waiting to rush in and save Germany from encroaching Russian armies. As he tells these stories to his friends and confidants  you can see he is telling them to reassure himself  and not his friends.Then comes the final collapse. Hitler shoots his wife  Eva Braun  and then himself so as to prevent being captured and forced to face the music. Magda Goebells poisons her children  and then sits down to a game of solitaire before facing her own death. Joseph Goebells tries to salvage the German army  but finally gives in and shoots his wife and himself. Slowly but surely  every one of the Nazi officers in Hitler's bunker commits suicide.Traudl finally accepts that it is over  and joins the German army as it moves to the front lines to surrender. Finally  she passes through the Russian front. While she may have lived in freedom physically  it is doubtful she ever escaped the mental image of what she saw  and the horrible truth she learned about her Fuhrer's crimes.While we may have heard many ex-Nazi's and Nazi sympathizers claim to be oblivious to Hitler's true evil  Traudl Junge is the only one I'd ever believe. When the real Traudl appeared on screen at the end of the film and said she never knew of the Holocaust until the war ended  I felt sympathy for her and I understood the power Hitler had to blind young people and lead them astray.\""Downfall\"" has been surrounded by controversy since it debuted at the Toronto film festival last year. Critics said it sympathized too much with Hitler  which is obviously not true when you watch it. Others said it goes too far in it's depiction of Hitler's last days. Perhaps some people can not handle the sight of exploding heads and severed limbs  but to say this film goes too far is insane. How should this film depict it's subject? With sunshine and lollipops? World War II was brutal and  as such  so should any film depicting it be. Some people won't be able to handle it  but that's why we humans have discretion. We can decide what is okay for ourselves  and we can say no to whatever we think is bad for us. You don't have to watch this film.\""Downfall\"" is a vivid  graphic  firsthand reminder of the depth of Hitler's evil. It's makers are simply spreading the message that trying to forget evil will not change it's affect on us. Why shouldn't we depict Hitler in art the way \""Downfall\""'s makers have? It might be easier to live without thinking of him and seeing his human traits  but it wouldn't be any better to live that way.This film should become requ"
Equilibrium (2002),"this movie rocks :) its simply amazing and whats so wonderful about it is its simplicity and elegance...WELL DONE KURT WIMMER AND Christian BALE!!! Kurt wimmer as a director / writer is just great  so is Christian Bale ..amazing acting.. and i also liked the anti-hero taye diggs with his sly smiles and looks not a bad job at all :) the movie could have used a little bit more of realism though  but still as it is its really good and no matter how much i watch it i keep wanting to watch it again...bale's latest movie  batman returns  is not 1/2 as good as equilibrium... my most favorite scenes were not just the fight scenes or gun battles also how they are brainwashing the librarians   how the fight between the underground and the officials is going  but i just wish it wasn't soooooooo over-simplistic at times the storyline...and more depth was given to characterization or environment / setting...still overall its a wonderful movie - one of my favorites - go get it on DVD and watch it NOW u wont regret it :) Salam Aalaykum :)\t\In a futuristic world  a strict regime has eliminated war by suppressing emotions: books  art and music are strictly forbidden and feeling is a crime punishable by death.\"" OK I understand from the blurbs what message the movie is trying to give.But as far as I see it is just simple mishmash of sci-fi pics. I mean look at the those silly action sequences. A man who is trying to save the whole futuristic world with his own efforts! Come on even the Rambo sequences are more realistic.Kurt Wimmer has obviously made a movie where free thought has been banished  an Orwellian world typically. But if you have ever read Orwell and have seen any related movie on his works you can easily understand that this is not the solution he offered in his works. Yes he portrays such a world but he doesn't refer to a Messiah to save this world. Well action buffs may like this movie but for meticulous viewers I just say that they will be really bored with the typical dork action sequences.\tJohn Preston(Christian Bale) is a high ranked  futuristic cop who lives in future where emotion is illegal. Every man and woman must take a pill every day. The pill restrains humans from feeling emotion of any kind. John Preston enforces that law. Every rebel that won't take the pill  dies by John Preston's gun. Even his partner Partridge(Sean Bean)  was killed by John Preston for going off the pill. The killing of his partner mad John Preston decide not to take his pill one day. Preston started to enjoy it more and more. He eventually is off it for so long that he falls in love with Mary O'Brien(Emily Watson)and kills cops like him who suspect him. He digs his hole deeper and deeper in the hands of this futuristic tyranny.The movie is probably more well known for its amazing \""matrix-like\"" fight sequences  but it is actually very well done also. Christian Bale does an incredible job as John Preston which made me incredibly happy when I found out he was going to play Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins. I really liked Emily Watson's performance also. She did a great job as the rebellious but innocent girl that she portrayed. I really enjoy the plot also. It is kind of a mix between two classic novels (1984 and Fahrenheit 451). But even if the acting or story doesn't impress you  the special effects will. They are the best special effects i've ever seen besides The Matrix.I highly recommend this thriller.\tThis movie has a spectacular plot (post-apocalyptic world war III)  and thus a fascist regime in which feelings  emotions  and so forth are abhorred. Taye Diggs does a great job as Brandt  who takes over as Preston's assistant. I would have liked to have seen more of Sean Bean  but his presence was known anyhow. Christian Bale does an excellent job playing Grammaton Cleric John Preston. The action scenes in this movie surpass those of the once hailed Matrix (1999). The plot builds throughout the film to a brilliant climax near the end. This movie is one of my favorite action movies of all time with both a good plot  stellar acting  and excellent cinematography. Easily a 10/10 or ****/****\tI watched this movie late one night on one of the Encore channels. Stayed up past my bedtime I did. Then I recorded it the next time it was on. Watched it two more times and then  AND THEN  bought the DVD and watched it a couple if not three more times. First  I rarely will watch a movie twice unless enough time has passed that I have forgotten how it ends. There are just too many movies out there and not enough time. But this movie deserved the time. I loved the fight scenes  loved the premise of the movie  loved the acting (and seeing Christian Bale shirtless). Emily Watson is an amazing actress. It's rare these days to see an action/SciFi with actual plot and dialog. How can I care about a movie if I don't care about the characters? Anyway  watch it. I've lent the movie to about 5 guys and they all liked it. One guy is into the Martial Arts and he thought the fight scenes were awesome (my word -- his word/s was/were \""the fight scenes were well choreographed\"").Moral of the story is: watch it  you won't be disappointed. Oh  and I said \""Surprisingly Good\"" because I had never heard of the movie and was expecting some B movie crap -- what can I say  I couldn't sleep.\tFor some odd reason IMDb is the only place were this movie is being praised. In most countries this movie didn't even got a theatrical release or was only shown in a very limited amount of theaters and only for a short period. There is a very good reason for this for \""Equilibrium\"" simply is not a good movie. It really is nothing more than an average B-science-fiction movie and on top of that it's terrible unoriginal. Especially when you've seen movies like \""Fahrenheit 451\""  \""THX 1138\""  \""1984\""  \""Metropolis\""  \""Blade Runner\""...must I really go on? Basically there is no movie in the science-fiction genre were this movie didn't 'borrowed' heavily from.The concept itself of the movie isn't that terrible and the movie starts of quite promising but the movie never really becomes interesting after that point and the story gets predictable and doesn't always flow well. It's obvious that director Kurt Wimmer still has some learning to do when it comes to storytelling.Yes the movie does deserve praise for its visual look. It's obvious that the movie didn't had a terribly high budget and I must see that they handled this well and made the best out of it.The fight scene's are fairly good but simply too much over-the-top to find it really entertaining or believable. Also the ending disappoints heavily and overall the movie leaves a bad aftertaste.Christian Bale on the other hand is simply cool and wonderful in his role and he portrays a good main character/hero. Sean Bean also has a quite good role but don't be fooled people  his role is very limited  the same goes for William Fichtner.Quite frankly I don't see what this movie has got to distinct itself from other B-science-fiction movies. It has a unlikely and silly handled story that never flows really well and the action leaves a pointless impression. Yes not a lot of people are going to agree with me on this but in my opinion the critics were absolutely right this time. You're way better of watching a real science-fiction classic and masterpiece such as the movies I mentioned earlier above. This movie isn't even good or entertaining as a science-fiction action movie. In my humble opinion this movie is only still watchable thanks to Christian Bale.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/\tI'd never heard about this film until watching it the other day and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Sure  there is a bit of a Matrix feel about it in parts  a bit of Big Brother in other parts  and the premise that a society can suppress their feelings was a little hard to swallow at first  but I really got into this film.Christian Bale is good as the 'seemingly' cold hearted cleric out to stop all 'sense crime'...and I can see why he's gone on to do Batman Begins  he just seems right for it. The supporting cast really are that  they contribute to the story  but it's Bale that the film is following and his journey is very well presented.It is always hard watching a movie when the initial idea or concept seems very strange and foreign  but Equilibrium manages to help you get over that by giving you a good story and characters you are interested in (I wanted to slap his son).I know I said nothing in this to tell you what was going on  but I urge you to watch it and wait until the end when things start cookin'.\tFirst of all I want to say besides the fact that I am a big fan of Christian bale I think this movie is great   wonderful story   and nice action   not to over the top... the thing is this movie you can tell was not done on a high budget   but its wonderful this goes to show you don't need blockbuster special effects to have a good movie . the actors are all very good in their parts. Its funny to me how Christian bale has done very good movies in the past and never made super-stardom   yet he does batman which is a blockbuster and all of a sudden people pay attention ... matrix had keanu reeves i mean come on look at his acting compared to Christians and yet because he has the special effects in matrix people took notice OK I'm done ranting... thanks for listening\tThis movie is a relic of the year 2002  before the Wachowski Brothers had put an irrevocable nail in the coffin of the Matrix franchise by delivering a poor second movie and a really awful third one.The movie lifts so many things from the Matrix that it's difficult to list them all. Furthermore  it mostly lifts them pretty badly  and the budget is obviously about 100 times less than that of the Matrix. A sense of camp goofiness suffuses the entire affair  from the overly dramatic lighting  to the citizens standing in neat rows looking at a giant video screen with a talking head on it  to the high-concept premise itself. In one way it's like the Showgirls of early-21st century science fiction movies.Nevertheless  the film is fun. It's mostly saved by the stellar performance of Christian Bale in the lead  who has clearly been told  \""OK  put on this outfit that we stole from Neo in the Matrix. Now act exactly like Keanu Reeves.\"" Fortunately  Bale is good at doing this  and is generally a better actor than the robotic Reeves.The supporting cast all put in some excellent work as well. Probably the most engaging part of the movie is watching them gamely play along and put in serious hard work as the story gets more and more ridiculous. I was very impressed by their professionalism.Probably my favorite scene involves a character who kills at least eight people to save a little puppy (said puppy seems to be played in some scenes by a rather unconvincing hand puppet). What a moral statement for the ages -- along with the timeless message  \""ruthlessly destroying all forms of art and literature in order to eradicate emotion from humankind... would be WRONG.\"" Campy entertainment.\tA 9 out of 10 only for some budget deficiencies that show a bit. By all means skip the director commentary because its all whining about lack of funds. Understandable  but obnoxious to sit through. Let me just comment on a few things not much mentioned in the customer reviews. First  despite what's stated by many and even the IMDb plot summary  the population shown here is not drugged to the point of being \""emotionless\"". People have to feel enough to care about family  obeying the rules  succeeding at their jobs  etc. Rather  the highs and lows of emotion have been chemically eliminated. Although this is taught from birth to be necessary for \""sense\"" purity  the real reason is that it makes it easier for a repressive regime to stay in power and at least partially prevent rebellion. And for anyone who thinks the mass public attendance of televised political harangues is unrealistic  go rent \""Triumph of the Will\"" by the chronicler of Nazi ascendancy  Leni Riefenstahl. And remind yourself that Hitler's adoring masses weren't even drugged.Second  although the drug is used to control emotions  its good old indoctrination that dictates behavior. The drugged state is reinforced by every mind control practice you can think of. Children are rewarded for ratting out parents  friends tattle on friends  etc. While the immediate reward is continued survival of the ratter at the expense of the rattee  you still get the sense that even children can feel some level of satisfaction in having earned brownie points  done their \""duty\""  cleansed their family  whatever. Careful watching or re-watching of this movie shows that people around the edges of the main characters express flickers of emotion according to their job status  with those in more regular jobs having less rein on their responses. By contrast one key character is obviously off his meds  though some viewers seem to think this was either bad acting or some kind of continuity error. Actually its important to the plot.In a truly emotionless society no one would even bother to procreate or care for children. So even John Preston (Christian Bale) seems permitted to indicate a flicker of pride over his young son's acceptance into the cleric training school  which he expresses right in front of the most important boss he has. From what we see its only he and his fellow Grammaton Clerics who are trained to squelch their emotions entirely  as well they might since they are the cruel enforcement arm of their society's vicious goals.Third  Bale deserves a lot of credit for the way this movie succeeds. He does a wonderful job of making us care about a nearly-expressionless man who sets his own liberation in motion through one simple accident (or is it?) while brushing his teeth  a small personal cleansing that suggests bigger things are coming. He's soon slammed hard by emotions he's never been allowed to feel  emotions that both intrigue and frighten him and which he dare not express. Its almost worth the price of rental/purchase to see him play a man hearing his first music  or sitting and watching his children sleep late one night. Even as we realize he's feeling paternal love to a degree he's never felt it before  the fact remains he still can't show it and his kids can't know it or they'll turn him in. By the time he reviews a key event in his personal life  you can feel its horrific impact on him by the merest flicker of reaction on his face  and in the tiniest changes in body language. The tension between what he realizes and feels and what he dares to show builds to an agonizing sub-climax that sets the finale in motion.Fourth  the ironic different between what is expected of people in this dark future and how human nature really operates is used to great effect. Preston's special skill as a cleric is his ability to anticipate what lies beneath  what's behind the wall  what his quarry is thinking. In other words  to sense. This makes him suspect as well as valuable to his masters. The feeling of personal jeopardy builds wonderfully as he experiences more and struggles harderto hide it  particularly as he realizes his special mission is being scrutinized by his new partner.The best sci-fi is never about technology  the best martial arts movies are never about the fighting. The human heart may never have perfect equilibrium  and this quiet little classic of a movie sure never got its due in a limited theatrical release. But its worth your time and then some.\tThe Fact that many People compare this Movie with the Matrix movies is quite wrong. The Story has nothing to do with the Matrix. The only parallels are that in Equilibrium there are also ShootOuts  but that's it.Bales' Performance is better in an emotional way  because we follow him throughout the movie and see him becoming another man than before (i don't want to spoil to much). That is the main Point of this Movie.while the Matrix focuses more on the world around. Of course we follow Neo (Reeves) but in the Matrix the change of the world and how Neo looks at it is more important.Just want to say  that the Matrix' Plot is quite more interesting but Equilibriums' Plot is much more emotional. Still that doesn't mean Equilibriums' Plot is weak  it's good and well developed!Still both movies have great ShootOuts and Action in it. Both are great!Equilibrium delivers itself as an ActionPacked  extremely cool but also emotional and well acted movie  which is fun to watch.8/10\tThis movie has obvious lapses in plot logic. However the viewer is not bothered by this  even if it does make the film seem older than it is. Maybe because it is basically a remake of Fahrenheit 451. There are some interesting concepts in there  the gun Kata theory I found it to be cool.As in Fahrenheit 451 a law enforcer tries to find works of art and destroy them along with any people that refuse to take the drug that makes them not feel anything. In the end he becomes a \""feeler\"" and helps the resistance overthrow the government.I think the fights were awesome  maybe they influenced those in Matrix. The actors played well. The plot was both reminiscent of the Fahrenheit 451 idea and also original in some of the aspects.I hated to see people being motivated by emotional speeches in a world that is supposed to not feel. I hated the way the main character always had his guns on him  even when he was supposed to have been searched and relieved of his weapons.All in all it was a very good movie  but it could have been better with a little more patience and maybe a higher budget. A must see for all Matrix fans :)\tSilly  predictable  seriously flawed  with moments that are outright laughable  Equilibrium nonetheless transcends all of these and through its compelling performances and fun pseudo-comic book settings delivers a powerful emotional punch that should resonate strongly for anyone who loves stark  stylistic Orwellian drama.In a future dominated by Father (with a not so subtle nod to \""Big Brother\"")  emotions have been eliminated and feeling is a crime  punished by immediate incineration - along with things like art  music  literature  friendship  love and everything else that makes life worth living. Wisely  there is an underground rebellion contingency who continue to \""live.\"" Among them  Emily Watson's saintly  emotional Mary O'Brien. These folk are  naturally  hunted down by the Grammaton Clerics  that physically fit bastion of unfeeling purity out to uphold and enforce the law.Christian Bale as Cleric John Preston gives a performance that is simply terrific offering a fascinating character study. One witnesses in anticipation as  throughout the slow process Preston's emotion free automaton - the pride of the Tetragrammaton - evolves into freedomfighter and ultimately liberator. Watch as  for the first time  Preston listens to music (the opening measures of Beethoven's 9th Symphony) and through his face captures and reveals the range of awe and wonderment as though awakening from a lifelong coma. Bale is more than up to the task as we watch his Cleric struggle with his newfound duplicity and makes route for him  but still believe the man may very well fail his mission.Director  Kurt Wimmer  in what appears to be his first big screen directorial job  has created an entire new  faux martial arts: \""Gun-Kata.\"" Gun-Kata is a highly stylized combination of two handed gun fighting and classic tai-chi/martial arts movement based on \""a scientific analysis of bullet trajectory and range\"" combined with mathematics  etc. At first  it is almost painfully hilarious to watch  but give in and it achieves a type of anime  hyper realistic that can only be described as \""wicked cool!\"" Bale's Preston is THE master of Gun-Kata and as he inevitably goes after \""Father\"" his penultimate fight with former partner Taye Diggs' will leave you cheering.Like a great conductor  Wimmer brings together all of the disparate elements of his symphony with its wordless  choral based soundtrack  jumps every hurdle and flaw  delivering a terrific movie full of action  meaning and emotion\tIt seems to be a common statement with some viewers  that Equilibrium is just another one of those action films that was strategically made to look and feel much like \""The Matrix\"" (both visually and in it's overall storyline) but I disagree. Yes  while there may be some similarities  I tend to think that Equilibrium as a film in it's entirety is wholly different. If anything  the movie actually reminded me more of a cross between George Lucas' THX-1138 & Fahrenheit 451 (obviously!) But what is absolutely excellent about this movie is Wimmer's introduction of the \""Gun-Kata\"" fighting style. Christian Bale does a great job as the lead and carries a very distinct presence with his character althroughout. The sets are amazing  the sound is amazing and the cinematography is top-notch. If you're a fan of truly dramatic action films that don't follow predictable stereotypes and aren't loaded with careless plot-holes  then see this movie. I really am disappointed that it never got an American theatrical release...\tI already saw this movie 10 times. The argument is so really close to the oppression we face on some societies  the lack of feeling humanity has for itself  that it seams  we are not on the 21st century at all  but at the Time LIBRIA exists. We are there NOW.The emotions being found  little by little  the self control  the fight scenes  highly coordinate  and this BEFORE MAtrix ever exited... The scenarios are very realistic  and the creation of a crowded city  is accomplished. Some details  like the Cleric  \""feeling\"" the stairs guide  is amazing  as one can find a emotion  just by touching bare metal.It is by all means a super Movie. Here in Portugal  i only found about it some time ago  but i already ordered one copy.\tI watched this movie after hearing my brother say that it was one of his favorite movies of all time. I usually agree with him on stuff like this  so I went in with high expectations. Unfortunately  I was very disappointed...The movie is set in a utopian society reminiscent of stuff like Brave New World  1984  and Fahrenheit 451 where human emotion is outlawed and any objects which invoke feeling are too be destroyed  and it follows the predictable tale of one of the Clerics  the people who enforce those laws  as he begins to feel and such. Now story was never meant to be the main draw of the movie  so I can forgive this.The real main draw is supposed to be the fight scenes  a mix of martial arts and gunplay. However  just as the emotionless society has sought to find the optimize their fighting style to find the single most efficient technique  so have the filmmakers optimized the fighting style to find the single coolest looking technique  namely the hero surrounded by a dozen or so guys and proceeding to kill all of them without breaking a sweat. Yes  it looked pretty cool the first time he did it  but this same scenario is played out at least 5 or 6 times with hardly any variation.The really only good parts in the film are a couple of emotional moments where the Cleric is caught in a tough situation that his newfound emotions have gotten him into or the final climax fight  which is the only truly original fight. Instead of the normal situation  we only have two guys each with one pistol. I can honestly say I've never seen a fight scene like that.Other than that  its just a mediocre compilation of clich\u00e9s from The Matrix  Brave New World  1984  etc.\tFor many years  novels have been written about futuristic worlds with certain elements of daily life taken away. Fahrenheit 451 dealt with brainwashing and literature outlawed. THX 1138 is about a society where all personal freedoms are taken away and everyone is under surveillance. This eerie view of the future makes for a great story and many of these have been turned into movies.Equilibrium is about one of those societies. Here we have a society that enforces strict rules about certain items that people cannot possess. These items might invoke feelings of any kind. Art  literature  music  or anything of this nature is collected and destroyed. The 'Father' has demanded that no one have emotions. This is done thanks to the breakthrough drug called Prozium II  a small capsule injected into the neck at certain times of the day. It is here that the government has a task force out to capture and \""process\"" any offenders of the law. Special agents known as Cleric's eliminate these people with swift  agile moves...and the help of some powerful handguns. The agency's top Cleric is John Preston (Christian Bale)  the most lethal of all the Clerics. He has just discovered that his partner Partidge (Sean Bean) has been sneaking out into the ruins outside the city walls referred as the \""nether\"". Partridge has ceased taking his Prozium and has developed feelings and a taste for reading  an offense punishable by death. Preston must carry out the order to \""process\"" his partner.After breaking one of his Prozium capsules  Preston goes to get another replacement so he can't feel. But delays inhibit this and he and his new partner Cleric Brandt (Taya Diggs) go out on another bust. This time  Preston doesn't know how to react due to his temporary drug free state of mind. He begins to realize why Partridge stopped injecting the drug...emotions were a key element to the human state of being. After finding and arresting an offender named Mary (Emily Watson)  he realizes that she isn't a bad person. The thought of killing her makes him think of his own wife's execution due to her being off her drugs. At the time he couldn't feel anything  now he can.What follows is an intense battle against right vs. wrong. The struggle between Preston and the government. He must keep his emotions secret or he too will be terminated. Bale is very believable as the tormented Cleric. He gives the character no emotions at first followed by a realization of what he has missed; sadness  happiness  and anger  which may work with his unbelievable killing abilities. Much like other works of this kind  Equilibrium shows us when a government has total control  the people are helpless. All it needs is one spark...aka John Preston. Writer/director Kurt Wimmer (wrote The Recruit) invites us on a wild ride through a new world full of lies  death  and struggle in a society that seems perfect...to some. To others this is inhumane. To the resistance this is a time to rise up and take back their lives and win their freedom.Equilibrium is a great addition to any science fiction lover's collection. It has a great storyline that stays true to its genre. A good cast makes this world come to life. It's hard to think of a society with no emotions. A society ruled by one man...one drug. With one look you can be executed. A force rises up from underground...all it needs is one spark...\tKurt Wimmer's Sci-fi thriller  was surprisingly good. The story takes place in the future  world is heading in a bad direction. No art  no music  etc\u0085 they believe all these things are responsible for war\u0085 therefore anybody who owns art  music  etc\u0085 is betraying the government  and is to be killed by special police lead by clerics. The story becomes interesting when one cleric (bale) begins to question the system. The film has very good direction  story and premise. The acting is first-rate  except for Taye Diggs who I din't like much  Bale  bean and Watson shined though. The script is good  and direction is solid by Wimmer who had directed nothing notable before this. His script is good  better than The Recruit which is the only other film written by Wimmer that I have seen. Equilibrium had some very good gun and action sequences as well  only problem I had with it was the fact that it borrowed from so many other movies or pieces of literature. However I guess with this kind of plot you can't be completely original  however I did enjoy this film  despite it being a bit too long. 8/10\tkudos to Christian Bale in equilibrium. he was awesome. equilibrium is a meaningful sci-fi movie with matrix style settings. though it could have been more extensive. the movie was too brief. a sci-fi movie like this should not be overlooked. it is possible for Kurt Wimmer to expand the equilibrium storyline for the sequel. the futuristic society in equilibrium should be explored in further detail. the scenario post modern Berlin Germany. the precision of the dialogue. the kick ass fight scenes was most excellent. the prozium dose cartridge. what a society they live in. the dark and dull colored but well designed costumes. the collective conformity into their abysmal destiny. all this features make equilibrium so fascinating to watch. if you are into the matrix movies watch this with appreciation. equilibrium sequel.\tA shame that this great film was given a limited release and was bashed for copy-catting 'The Matrix.\"" However  it has since been propelled to a much deserved cult status.The only real resemblance to 'The Matrix' here are the trench-coats  and in that movie the characters only wear them at the end. Flashy gun fights have been around for a long  long time and so has bullet dodging. I can remember bullet dodging back to the early 90s in 'Remo Williams.' So this film is an independent new idea in its own right. AND IT ROCKS! The sets  costumes  and action all show talent and make this look like a huge big budget epic. The central idea of regaining emotions is presented well with Christian Bale giving a very good performance. Also despite the lack of extensive CGI some of the gunfights and action scenes blow other movies right out of the water  most notably an awesome hallway battle towards the end. Each fight scene has cool camera tricks that make CGI totally unnecessary and as a result the action looks and feels much more real. However  probably much more importantly  the story is among the most interesting in recent sci-fi films. While some argue its originality this sure doesn't rip off any recent sci-fi movie and while the idea has been dealt with before  the superior realization here is more than enough to see this film.So if your in for a good visionary action thriller watch this. You won't be disappointed. I rate it 10/10 Rated R: intense violence"""
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004),"Joel Barish(Jim Carrey)finds out that Clementine Kruczynski(Kate Winslet) had Joel erased from her memory after a terrible break up. Breaking his heart even more  he too attempts to have his memory erased of her through this futuristic process of destroying memories. As Joel is unconscious  he remembers their relationship chronologically up to the point where they first met  realizing that he is making a mistake.Jim Carrey is known for being a smart-ass comedian and probably not considered to be a \good\"" actor. Whoever has put this label on Jim has not seen Eternel Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. He proves to be an outstanding actor in this story of fate. His humor is still present  but he brings a balance to the movie  making one of the greatest films ever made. With the amazing cast of Jim Carrey  Kate Winslet  Kirsten Dunst  Mark Ruffalo  Elijah Wood  and Tom Wilkinson  it is quite certain that the movie's acting will be great and it was. The audience feels every effect needed to make this movie an emotional roller coaster. The moods strike the viewer with a vast intensity of realism and relation to certain portions. The writing shows to great also with incredible conversations about fate and love. Overall  this movie is absolutely flawless and will definitely be considered a modern classic. It is amazing in every aspect and is kind of a tear-jerker.I highly recommend this movie.\tFirst of all  this is NOT a Mask or Ace Ventura. I believe that most people saw Jim Carreys name on the cast and thought this would be a wonderful little In Living Colour skit. This is the first time I can actually say I Like Jim Carrey  I like him A lot. His acting in this movie  alongside Kate Winslet  was superb. I remember when I saw this in the theater  I was fighting with my girlfriend. I ran out of the theater and called her. That is the impact this movie can have. I do  however  recommend watching this at least twice before making a judgment on it. The first time you can be very confused  and almost lost at certain parts. The reward is finally understanding the plot. Some wonderful music really sets the mood as well. Beck has a very important role in this movie  when Joel is breaking down as the rain pours down. Do yourself a favor and give this movie a chance  or for some a second chance.\tDon't you all get angry at me but I have to admit that this movie was an absolute failure. It seemed interesting in the trailers and the reviews praised and I went to see it. How wrong were both of those. I left the movie in disgust at how I wasted ten dollars on it. I thought that the casting was inept and that the storyline was trite and iffy. None of the Actors were Oscar-Quality. There were so many other great films than this including Ray  The Aviator  Sideways  etc. And don't any of you say that I don't get \""this movie\"" since I saw it once in the theatres and watched it twice on DVD when I borrowed it from a friend. My opinion never faltered.Addition: This movie is on the Top 250? It's friggin number 36 beating out the unbelievable Taxi Driver in number 37. This film has absolutely no reason to be here on this list. It is taking up spots that rightly belong to Network  which is one of the greatest written satire films starring some the greatest actors  three of which won Oscars specifically for the film. Shame on all of you for liking this film.Addition 2: Finally  an update  with glee to finally see this movie sink below Taxi Driver as it should. I am happy to see a classic work of art beat this contrived load of bull-hooey that receives so much attention since it's so arty... go see Brick if you want an arty and awesome movie.\tthis movie really makes you think  it is reasonably well done and has points that.. well  you have to experience.I highly recommend this movie.do not be sidetracked about the reputation of these actors. it isn't slapstick  it is not mostly stupid comedy.it isn't something you will enjoy  if you are not the kind of person who likes suspense and thinking in new directions.I can't describe this movie without spoiling it so  i'm not going to.I am grateful my friends shared this movie with me. especially good to watch when you are having a suck day  but don't feel like watching comedy.I rate this movie 3 tissues and a pillow. some crying and a Lot of emotional frustration.\tWhen we reach crisis moments with someone we love  we are faced with a couple of ways to deal with it  depending on the circumstances.One way  vis a vis pessimism  is in assuming something is so broken that it isn't fixable. And so we take measures to fully complete that break. Even when this is necessary  it is still painful because there's always a little bit of self-destruction that is unavoidable. Erasing memories involve erasing little parts of ourselves as well.Another way  more in hope  is to consciously reach back and search out all the good memories  so as to recreate the once shared life based upon those genuine moments and experiences. This is intended to fuel our desire to save the sinking ship. A declaration of interdependence is drafted in one's mind  something giving evidence that the positives of the relationship well outweigh the negatives  and those negatives are seen as just part of the package.So Kaufman  et al  drew up a scenario in which both of these approaches occur within the same relationship. To bring us deep into the broken psyche of someone in this situation  we begin at the aftermath of the end (after some preliminaries)  and we work backwards. Isn't that what people do when they mull over a painful split with someone they love? Working backwards every step  through the good and the bad  to survey all the pictures that were painted  the visions co-created  the inspirations drawn from each other and for each other.It's a sort of mnemonic museum at that point  but as time begins to flatten those landscapes  the walls begin to crumble  the pictures will become fractured and dirty and harder to discern. Faces are blurred. Items are missing. Memories are trodden by frantic changes in circumstances.The peculiar cinematic genius here  of course  and what makes this film a must-see  is in exactly how Kaufman and Gondry present this phenomenon. The massive  compelling centerpiece of this film is the single  vivid night of our protagonist Joel who  in the most literal sense possible  chases down his fading dreams of Clementine.Thankfully  we have a director who is masterful at cinematic flow of the quirky  so that the convoluted arrangement of memories  visions and various interspliced scenes are strung together in a complex tapestry that does not quite overwhelm our senses. We can accept this theatrical style put to new use in a truthful dream logic. For instance  Joel walks us directly from the trauma at Barnes and Nobles to reflective conversation in a neighbor's apartment  in a seamless flow (the only seam possibly being a door frame  but it's more of an incidental passage marker); lending immediacy to his confusion over that fresh experience  visually recalled within a somber dialogue. And that was just to prepare us for the spectacular night journey to come  having been foreshadowed by the series of lights turning off in the bookstore. An atypical journey  instead of events unfolding  they are folding back in on themselves. A multitude of vignettes in reverse is a very unique form of storytelling.One more point. It must be a great time to be an actor who gets to be involved in these kinds of projects. The kinds of projects I'm talking about are where a main character  as narrator and guide  take us down a certain path in the story. But then (typically within the climax of the third act) it is revealed that this path was unreliable from the start  fantasy  or deception. And so we as the audience have to reach back and reinterpret all the mannerisms and motives of at least some of the characters we think we have come to know. (Think of the Usual Suspects  where in the final series of explanations we are offered several possible alternatives  and so we have to construct several possible characters out of a single actor).So the actors in Eternal Sunshine get to act within at least two possible dimensions at the same time  always striding the possibilities that will be presented later  in a way to convince us of things we are not really supposed to be convinced of. Of course its fun to be tricked by sudden twists in the story  but the real treat is in the acting that is open to interpretation. I have no problem with this being a recent clich\u00e9 in \""edgy\"" films  because it encourages deeper levels of interaction from the audience. It is one more way for a film to effectively reach out and mingle with our spotted minds.\tI admit I only saw about the first 45 minutes; I just could not stand any more; this film was excruciating to watch. Worse by far than the nasty ''Adaptation.'' Probably second only to \""Sweetie \"" another horrifying film billed as a comedy. How could Kate Winslet  after her terrific performance in ''Iris '' have signed on for this trash? Did the filmmakers set out to induce headache and nausea? The story  the lighting  the camera-work  the editing--they really made me seasick. And it's hard to care about characters who don't like themselves enough to engage in basic grooming. What in the world was romantic about this story of abuse  alcoholism  relationship addiction  and depravity? There was no compassion for the obvious sickness of the characters. Uck  uck  uck. I wish I could erase the memory of this piece of pretentious  stomach-turning nonsense from my aching head.\tBy now  if you are unfamiliar with the name Charlie Kaufman (in other words  if you have spent the last three years in outer space)  that is undoubtedly a damn shame. Charlie Kaufman is unquestionably one of the most extraordinary and one of the (if not the) most inventive screenwriters in the game today. His previous projects  including Being John Malkovich and Adaptation  have broken cinematic formulas and expectations alike  and in doing so  both have become modern-day unparalleled masterworks. Fortunately  with his newest effort  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  Kaufman does not fall far from the level of innovation he emanated with his first two features. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a strikingly original story that blends both romance and memory loss like no other. It is yet another eccentric and aesthetic tale from one of Hollywood's most gifted writers that all will surely find sharp  fresh  and cognitive.Not only has Kaufman pieced together a pioneering screenplay on an often-adapted subject matter  but he has also concocted an aptly named title that has the power to place viewers in a state of surrealism and wonderment right from the get-go. The title of the picture is taken from a poem entitled \""Eloisa to Abelard\"" by Alexander Pope. This historic elegy  which Kaufman also used in Being John Malkovich  directly refers to the human brain's power of recollection. Reminiscent of both Memento and 50 First Dates  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind deals with the loss of memory; however  Kaufman's script gives the frequently used topic an appetizing twist.On a train to Montauk  Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) happens to meet Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet)  a candid yet electric woman  who more-or-less seems like she could complete Joel in every way. The two form a relationship  and establish many happy memories together. Even so  in due time  their connection comes to a halt\u0097Clementine becomes bored with Joel and Joel believes Clementine is too dependent.Immediately after the breakup  Clementine chooses to have Joel erased from her memory. She travels to Lacuna Inc. \u0096 a company that specializes in the futuristic service of memory erasure \u0096 to seek the help of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson).Once Joel discovers that Clementine erased him from her head entirely  he reports directly to Lacuna for the very same service. However  once the Lacuna employees  Patrick (Elijah Wood)  Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Mary (Kirsten Dunst)  start wiping out Clementine from Joel's mind  their service becomes a disservice; Joel becomes contrite and changes his mind about the procedure. Even though Joel is unconscious during the entire attempted erasure  he consciously tries to retain the memories of his love for Clementine within the walls of his own head  and attempts to hang on to at least a fragment of what they once had.There is no question about it  this Jim Carrey's finest work. He brings a clear spirited depth to the part of Joel\u0097making Joel Jim's most stark yet most respectable character role to date. Even though Eternal Sunshine may not be one of Jim biggest money making endeavors (compared to his comedies)  it certainly puts him on the path of being perceived as an actor who is capable of seriousness. At far as earning an Oscar nod for '04  because of the film's early release date and the fierce competition up for the Best Actor nominations  Jim will most likely be gypped.In addition to Carrey's career performance  the remainder of the ensemble cast fares equally as well. Kate Winslet serves up some of her best non English-accented acting as the orange-haired and sporadically veclempt Clementine. (Sorry for the Yiddish slang.) Her work here is arguably better than anything else she has done\u0097with the possible exception of her other near-astounding 2004 effort in Finding Neverland. Kirsten Dunst and Mark Ruffalo are as faultless as always  and both Tom Wilkinson and Elijah Wood are as top-notch as expected in their respective supporting roles.With his superb use of light (or more appropriately darkness) and his watertight scene transitions  director Michel Gondry has crafted an utter joy of a film that cleverly starts out near the end and then wraps back upon itself by the conclusion. Overall  the quirky yet visual genius of Gondry combined with the warped yet brilliant mind of Charlie Kaufman has undoubtedly resulted in a beautiful and poignant romance. The manner in which Eternal Sunshine blends its romance and comedy gives the film a strong sense of undeniable individuality and makes for an overtly pleasing picture. Eternal Sunshine has the aptitude to tickle your thinking cap  sooth your sight  and hypnotize your heart. Beyond any shadow of a doubt  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind belongs in the absolute upper echelon of all that is romantic and unique.\t\""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\""  one of the most overrated films of recent years  is mostly a parable about how humans should accept their destiny instead of escaping it. But while the general meaning is fairly simple  the script is complex  using a non-linear narrative (a la \""Lost Highway\"" or \""Memento\"")  confusing past and present  dream and reality  the lives of the main characters etc.The direction further enhances this elaborate scheme: there are cut-ups  special effects  imaginative montage techniques  but also a post-modern overlapping between genres. Thus the film is sometimes a lyrical love-story  at other times a comedy  realist drama  Freudian analysis and so on. Unfortunately  a big part of the movie resorts to Hollywood melodrama (complete with generic sentimental soundtrack music). It feels as if the director is mostly interested in showing off his skills rather than presenting an interesting and organic movie. Vastly inferior to the similar \""L'Appartement\"" (1996  Gilles Mimouni).\tI had the pleasure of watching this movie for the first time with my girlfriend. Scrolling through the selections of movies  she saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind on the channel guide. She and both of her friends suddenly went ballistic  saying that I must watch this movie with them! I reluctantly agreed as I had never heard of it before. I checked the info  and saw that it had Jim Carry and Kate Winslet in it. 'Good actors'  I thought to myself and I turned it on.My skepticism quickly vanished and I became hooked on the movie. The storyline  the soundtrack  and the especially the acting are excellent. Carry and Winslet are at their very best in this movie. Talk about chemistry between two actors  it's a shame they haven't been in more movies together! Carry shows in this movie that he indeed can transition into serious roles  much like Robin Williams did during his career. Winslet on the other hand absolutely steals the screen without taking the spotlight to much from Carry. They both touched emotions and feelings that most of us have experienced sometime in our life flawlessly.The storyline in itself is unique and makes you think of all the 'what if's'. It brings out every emotion you can possibly think of  and the soundtrack amplifies it. Speaking of the soundtrack  there are sometimes that it is absolutely haunting and in general fits perfectly.I'm a pretty solid guy  especially in front of my girlfriend. But the movie did indeed bring out the flow of tears. It has joined a short list of movies that have stimulated those hidden guy emotions. I found that the more I related to the characters  the harder it was to control my emotions.I highly recommend this movie if you like new and refreshing ideas on screen. It has joined my collection of DVD's and has joined my list of favorite movies. This movie will not leave your mind spotless  as it reminds us of the important  and sometimes forgotten parts of our lives.\tThis film is quite simply jaw-dropping. Jim Carrey turns in a career-altering performance - one which I believe a lot of his fans were faithfully awaiting - as a lovestruck  confused individual who gradually comes to realize that his memories of the romance of his life were completely erased and by his hand  no less. The film itself is inventive  quirky and  I believe  a revolutionary step in not only romantic films  but in cinema as a whole. While many of you guys may be thinking that this is a chick flick and the total opposite of your own tastes  it is rather a film that can be incredibly enjoyable to all and especially to men  according to a survey at a film website (I forget the name just now) but the point is that you should let society's stereotypical views of romantic movies prevent you from renting this one.\tEternal sunshine of the spotless mind was a marvelous  deep  dark  emotion driven picture that left t me almost speechless... Iwatched it in the afternoon and invited a friend over to watch it in the evening... I have never watched a movie more than once in a months time let alone in the same day... The way Joel(Carry) tries to get out of the memories mapped to be erased lightens the mood of the movie and you start to have hope... The end when they are listening to the tapes shows the reality of the two love thirsty lovers... it is amazing how hard it is to make a movie like this without loop holes... like if the mind is erased wouldn't you think your mother would be like\""you need to get her... you were happier with her\"" and bring her back into his memory??? but he doesn't even bother with the extreme details and allows the viewers imagination run wild...He didn't tell the story as if he read it from a text book... he told the story as if he lived it which allows the listener to run wild with their imagination... I loved the Story...Charlie Kaufman & Michel Gondry did an amazing job together on this one... Must See!!! A- *Top Shelf W.B.\tWhat is the purpose of reincarnation if one has no memory of a previous life? How can you learn from your mistakes if you've forgotten that you ever made them? And what passes from a previous life to the next if there is no memory of a previous existence?In a subtle way this movie addresses these questions. But instead of lifetimes  love affairs are used. And it's love that passes through the generations. Soul mates are destined to find each other  again and again  despite the trivial incompatibilities. This is a marvelous  original movie. Beautifully  and acted directed. The film is not really a science fiction. It's a moral parable.\tThis movie is a love story  except if you go in to see it  it's anything but ordinary. First things first  you must let your imagination roam a little bit. The whole process of being able to actually be inside your own mind as you slowly watch the love of your life being erased in front of your very eyes can be a bit much if you don't use your imagination. Best thing to do  put yourself  whether your male or female  in Joel Barrish's (Jim Carey) shoes. Now  the basics of the story are very relatable. Man and woman meet  opposites attract  and they fall in love. However  as with all things in life  they come to part ways. Joel discovers rather quickly  after running into his former girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet)  that she has had him permanently erased from her memory. Confused  Joel seeks out the doctor who performed the procedure  and in a fit of anger  possibly even revenge  he decides to have the procedure done himself. However  as the procedure takes place  as he moves from the last memory of Clementine (a wonderful scene mixed with harsh feelings and dialogue) backwards to the memories of when the relationship was at it's peak  he begins to realize that in his heart he still loves her. Joel panics  and begins to think of every way possible to change the track of his memories so that Clementine will still be there in his mind whenever he wakes up. Fate  nonetheless  does not conspire with him  and he finally comes to the last (or in this case  the first) memory; the one where he and Clementine first met. The following scene is absolutely wonderful. This is where it all comes together...everything that has happened in the story  with the addition of the strong feeling's Joel has for Clementine (and in Clementine's case  the feelings she may still have for Joel)  it all climax's in this beautiful scene  highlighted with:Clementine: This is it  Joel...it's going to be gone soon. Joel: I know... Clementine: What should we do? Joel: (pauses) Enjoy it.This scene comes crashing down and gave me such a great case of emotion  because Joel  even after trying to hide from having Clementine erased learns this simple lesson: Life is fleeting. Life  and the people you meet and love  is a gift. And even though he knows he is about to lose her forever  instead of trying to run and hide  he swallows those feelings back  and tells himself to 'enjoy it ' a truly mature and engaging line that will bring chills down your spine. And the final scene in the house  brings the climax to it's end in a truly remarkable way. As they say their final goodbyes inside an old house on the beach  as Joel's character let's out every single emotion and thought inside of his heart out. Not only is the dialogue amazing  but the image of that memory being erased and the fact that he is losing her is amplified by the fact that as the scene slowly progresses  the house begins to fall apart. You begin to feel such an apathy for these characters  and maybe it's because we've all been there before. Everyone of us. This story is so relatable it forces you to become immersed in the story's emotions and characters. The writing and directing simply phenomenal  my hat's go off to Micheal Gondry. The only reason I give this movie a nine of ten is the ending. I won't give away too many details  because the ending makes the story. I would've changed the ending slightly and not have gone into the ending like the story portrays. However  my opinions aside  if you haven't seen this movie  you must. It may be confusing at first  but you'll get it. Watch it again if you need to. But if after watching this movie  if you don't re-examine certain aspects of your life  if this movie doesn't make you love your significant other ever more or make you pine for the lost love of your life  then unfortunately you didn't get the point. Watch it one more time. For those of you who do feel as if you have watched an eye-opener  take life by the horns and 'enjoy it.'\tMichael Gondry's Eternal Sunshine is a brilliant piece of film-making. The story is told in such an original  yet charming and emotionally charged manner that one basically has no choice but to feel for these characters. Its the story of a man (carrey) who falls in love with an oddball girlfriend who suddenly acts like she doesn't know him. The film is superbly written  Kaufman's screenplay is finer and richer here than in Adaptation or Confessions of a Dangerous mind  IMO. The performances also make this film worthwhile  Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are absolutely perfect in the leads  both deserve Oscar nominations last year if you ask me. Also two actors who i usually do not like much in Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood are at the absolute best here (partially due to them  mostly due to the great script). Mark Ruffalo was a highlight for me  never have i seen him be a character so good  he was my most memorable performance of the film. Tom Wilkinson was also great  playing the role of a doctor. This film is beautiful  with great music  direction and extremely good chemistry. This is one of rare love story type films that i love  saw it twice just this week. 10/10 #50 on my list of all-time favorite films\tI turned this movie off after it was apparent that the director was not ever going to bring this into focus or tidy up the mess he had made. By then  Joel was an undignified 3 ft tall and Clem was a Southern ho. One viewer spoke of the movie as if an intoxicating poem but whatever he read into it was purely coincidental as this movie did not divulge any such information as to why the couple broke up  for example  although we glimpse an argument where Joel apologizes for a well-deserved comment hurled at Clem. One of the worst parts about it was the fact that the audience knew pathetically little about their apparently 2 year relationship or the threads that weaved their hearts together in the first place nor the cracks their love fell through. And why on earth anyone would want to be soul mates with the impossibly dimwitted  arrogant and offensive Clem is beyond all capacity for understanding. Once the erasing of the memories begins  the movie leaps and skids off it's digital tracks as if pieced from the cutting room floor by a five year old.\tTwo months before the Oscars were awarded  I heard this movie will be one of the candidates for many awards. I haven't watch it  but the title was telling me it will be the great pleasure watching it. I knew it isn't one of the sweet love stories and couldn't wait to buy DVD and see what can show me two of my favourite actors - wonderful Kate Winslet and amazing Jim Carrey. Two months later  I was disappointed (even though I didn't watch it) seeing how there were no Golden Globes for this movie  and it won only one Oscar. None of them for Kate or Jim. This summer I finally got the opportunity to see \""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\"". I'm a man  and men don't cry  but this time I cried. I was amazed by Jim's and Kate's performances  the story was absolutely fantastic  and this movie became my No1. Yes  I know it's a bit funny and odd being amazed by movie you didn't watch  but it happens to me very often. And when I finally spend my precious time watching that movies  I become satisfied. This time  I was more satisfied then I thought I would be. \""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\"" is the best movie ever!!! I know most of you won't agree with me  but if you watch it one more time  you will see how strong and healthy it is. I'm not saying healthy only because the tears are good  I'm saying it because it could clear you mind and learn you not to make sudden decisions. \""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\"" is basically the story about human nature. Made in extremely strange and  I think  experimental way  it told us how we can control our mind  but our heart will survive the changes and come out as one big winner. Mary (Kirsten Dunst) showed us it by re-falling in love with Doctor Howard. It showed us Joel and Clementine when they met again. Kate Winslet was great. She showed us one more time that she is one of the best actresses ever and I can't understand why she didn't win Oscar so far. She surely was better than Hilary Swank in \""Million Dollar Baby\"". Kate was the one who lead this movie. I watched her in \""Titanic\"" and were amazed by her possibilities  but this role was very hard and definitely her best. In \""Titanic\"" she was a lady  but here we could see her excellent Clementine  strange impulsive girl. Jim Carrey was amazing  especially in scenes of fight against erasing Clementine from his memory. I also can't understand why he didn't win at least nomination. He's probably the best example how Academy can make terrible mistakes. I was charmed by his acting in \""Man on the Moon\""  but this time he was even better. Kirsten Dunst was also very good  but Elijah Wood was the one that surprised me  pleasantly. Certainly the best technical part of this movie is camera. It was great. I've never seen such a great moves and scenes. It was like taking a part in all that's happening on the screen. Make-up was perfect. Jim Carrey looked really good; he was the perfect image of tired  devastated  depressive shy guy. Kate Winslet's hair was such a tasty detail. Two years before I couldn't imagine Kate having that colour  but when I saw it  I was stunned with surprise how good it was. And a screenplay \u0096 wonderful. So many nice dialogues  so much subtlety  so many nice thoughts. I especially liked the conversation between Mary and Doctor Howard  about wise thoughts  when I heard what Alexander Pope said about mind and heart. \""How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting  by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted  and each wish resign'd.\"" And I couldn't agree more with that. \""The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\"" is the greatest master-piece of all time. The best movie ever seen  the best story ever written!!!\tIf you are looking for a film about love that doesn't include cheesy chat-up lines  heart-shaped chocolate boxes and the guarantee that the protagonists will all live 'happily ever after'  then this is likely to be a film for you. For once  I have found a film that is not about love in a fairy-tale  but instead  is about true love that you find in the real world  with the bad and dull bits left in. In contrast though  this film never gets dull. For the entirety of my first viewing  I was sat in the cinema  with my eyes glued to the screen and welling-up throughout. I was impressed by Kate Winslet's (Clementine) and Jim Carrey's (Joel) acting  especially since I can not sit through most of Carrey's films because I generally find him so annoying"
Fantastic Four (I) (2005),"When this movie was first set to be made in the late 1990's with Chris Columbus attached to direct  it became every comic book fan's dream come true. But after years of delays and script rewrites Columbus dropped out and the studio had the brilliant idea of signing a untested director to head the picture .Tim Story's only major film was the lame comedy \Taxi\"" and yet he landed the job to direct a movie based on comic's first family. Story's fist mistake was casting Jessica Alba as Susan Storm. Her weak and wooden performance makes her co-star Chris Evans  who was badly cast as The Human Torch seem as a small problem. But then there was Michael and Ioan who were cast as The Thing and Mr. Fantastic. These to actors made the movie a little better to watch.But when it comes down to it Tim Story trades in action for a lame family comedy. This film had the potential to be a great action adventure film but it turns to be just another so so comic book movie.\tAfter reading the 'professional' reviews I went to see Fantastic Four with some trepidation  but the film is much better than many of these reviews would lead you to believe. The casting for the FF themselves was spot-on  and the film develops their personalities and relationships brilliantly. This is also the film's only real flaw - although the scenes showing how the Four adapt to their new-found powers and how they relate to each other are enjoyable  too much time is spent on this and not enough on developing the adventure itself. Victor von Doom's transformation to the evil Dr Doom is done fairly well  but Doom himself doesn't really come across as the towering evil genius you expect from the comics. There is none of the egomaniacal posturing or the grand \""Who dares to challenge the magnificence of Doom?\"" type lines we've all come to know and love from the comic books. Overall  though  the film was a pleasant surprise and well worth watching for anyone who has read the comics. For anyone who hasn't but who has the capacity to return to their childhood for a couple of hours  this is a good introduction to some clean  comic book fun.\tGreat film. The characters of the Thing and the Torch and their winding up of each other were superb  just like the comics. People say Reed is wooden  well that is what he was like (I date back to Lee/Kirby) in the comics and it worked for me.The action scenes were very good  I laughed out loud often and Jessica Alba  well Jesus  she is so hot I expected her to burst into flames! It is rare for me to see a film more than once on release  in fact I can't remember when I last did  but I am going to see this one again.Lastly  it was great for Jack Kirby's name to be up on the big screen  shame he is not around to see it.\tYes  slobbering. That's what you'll be doing at the back of the theater  your head slumped  your tongue hanging out  as you watch this week's Marvel-comic-book movie  \""Fantastic Four.\"" FF was my favorite comic book back when I was a wee lad. These were Stan Lee's original superheroes with \""feet of clay\"" (even before Spider-man). But the real heart of the comic was the Thing (Ben Grimm)--the big  tough wise guy with the big broken heart. And he is the one thing the movie got right--Michael Chiklis (and the impressive make up) capture the Thing perfectly.Unfortunately there are three other team members  who need to be \""developed\"": Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic)  Sue Storm (the Invisible Girl  er  Woman)  and Johnny Storm (the Human Torch). Ah  for the old comic-book origin story  where the four are shot up into space  are exposed to \""cosmic rays \"" crash back to earth  and immediately start manifesting their super powers. Before you know it  they're fighting the Mole Man (and sometimes each other).If only the movie had used such shorthand. Instead  well over half the flick is \""family\"" bickering as the Four discover their abilities--and the origin of Dr. Doom (their greatest enemy) is outlined.Doom is the movie's most serious misstep. In the comic books  Doom was a scientist who falls from the \""pure faith\"" (yes  \""he tampered in God's domain \"" to lift a bit from Ed Wood's \""Bride of the Monster\""). He had a regalness and grandeur about him  even as he tried to destroy the FF and take over the world (the perfect opposite of Reed). In the movie  Doom is another tiresome industrialist who (ala Norman \""Green Goblin\"" Osborn) obtains super powers. His showdown with the FF at the end is somewhat less than epic (and the climax rips off a bit of \""Terminator 2\"").The whole movie feels as though they shot a first-draft script (characters fairly trip over the loose ends  and Reed is about as much of a super genius as Wile E. Coyote). But there is the occasional chuckle  usually thanks to Bashful Benjy Grimm.\tI wanna start by saying how it annoys me how people think they can be hyper critical of what is and always was gonna be a popcorn flick! Why do you feel that you have to complain about the directing  cinematography  lighting  hairdresser etc etc...A popcorn film is supposed to be fun not serious so take it more lightly.Anyway on to the film  i remember the cartoon series of this which  while extremely dated  was a good giggle and extremely tongue in cheek  i feel the film portrays this very well. My one complaint was Dr Doom and how the character was poorly developed  unlike the Fantastic Four  we barely seen the powers of Doom. The FX were really good and the scene on the bridge was awesome  even compared to the superior Spiderman and Batman  in which this amount of effects would not have been out of place. The critics panned the effects used for the thing but personally i am happy that it is a man in a suit as apposed to a CGI created blob.The film does take on the usual \""first in a franchise\"" feel of character development over plot but i for one would happily watch a sequel if it plays out with as much fun as this. i wanted o give this film 7.5/10 but could only officially rate it 7/10 as opposed to round up to 8/10 as this is a popcorn flick not a ageless classic!\tOK  little or no depth of emotion to the characters...but whatever Its a popcorn movie. Dr Doom pretty cool...just wished more Doom and more ending...The movie seems to start almost at the end (as far as Doom's interaction)...the movie needed a lot more of that and less of establishing the Thing was p'd off  Torch was arrogant...etc.By the way was there always a romance b/w Mr fantastic and invisible girl?Overall  this movie is OK  but its no better (or worse) than Daredevil. Not the excitement of XMEN  not the Uniqueness of Hellboy  not the Hollywood buzz of Spidey or Batman. But is is better than war of the worlds (and the HULK  but that's a given)\tFantastic Four is an almost passable popcorn flick that doesn't offer much of anything. It's standard super hero fare in the most predictable of ways and this film ends up feeling like a T.V. movie with a big budget. The story concerns a group of unlikely scientists who go into space and are exposed to some sort of cosmic mutator that inevitably gives them bizarre powers. The CGI effects are alright  the acting ranges from bad to so so (with the occasional good performance from Ben a.k.a. The Thing)  there are three terrible jokes/gags for every good one and ultimately it's a waste of time. It's sad to see films ranging from mediocre to garbage topping the box office these days.\tFirstly I don't understand some comments saying that it could have done with more action. These days it is the kiss of death to be just another CGI movie as there really is nothing new to see anymore.The characters were all pretty true to the comics apart from Reed Richards who  although dedicated to his work  was never a geek. Doom was also a bit weak (character wise) for me.Linking up Alicia Masters and the Thing was one of the worst bits - A blind babe hits it off with a big orange lumpy guy within 2 seconds of meeting him and then at the end he says he's fine staying as he is! He's either more blind than she is or else he's gay.One thing that I miss from the comics is the ludicrously huge 'mad scientist' laboratories of both Doom and Richards where a the average piece of equipment was the size of a small building and looked like it could blow up a planet or two.Overall I enjoyed it right up until the final battle with Doom which had no element of suspense whatsoever.\tWithout being the best movie ever made this was a great start on this series -- and I hope it is enough of a start to provide us with sequels. I am just happy these characters are here. Some of this was very good. Very good indeed. There was not much more that could be done considering that the origin story had to be told.I loved the fight scene at the end. Thank you for putting these characters on the movie map......... There are some great FF story lines to work with. I am really looking forward to a great run with this series -- and fully expect these characters to blossom going forward. I don't see how they could have done much more without making a 3-hour movie. Let's kick even more butt in the films to come.Great start Thank you\tI'm your average guy  I don't read comic books  and I usually don't comment about movies. Here is some thing a lot of people who gave this movie a bad review might not understand. The Fantastic 4 is a great movie!!! Especially for people who are too young to remember the comic books or the show!!! I remember when I was 9 years old  The Fantastic 4 used to be on late night on Cartoon Network. That was the only time I remember hearing about them or seeing them on a main stage. Ten years later  a smile comes to my face when I hear about a movie being made about the superheroes I vaguely remember loving as a child. I don't read comic books. I could care less about the comic book accuracy. I just wanna see some guy burst into flames  fly  and say smart** comments. Spiderman didn't do it for me  X-Men didn't  the only Batman movie I truly enjoyed was Batman Forever (Robin was cool  and Christian Bale didn't even act in Batman Begins.) I've never enjoyed a superhero movie more than the Fantastic 4. It's got such a simple formula: What would you do if you woke up one morning with superpowers? Each character was real. Johnny was an adventurous guy before the accident  of course he's not going to stay cooped up in Reeds lab all day. Reed was a geek  he stayed a geek the whole movie. Sue was like... the \""dude  I totally wanna do your mom\"" type. She was responsible and everything... and she looked so hot in that cat suit. Ben was great as the family man who goes through the trauma of losing his wife and being out-casted.I loved the Fantastic 4 because each character goes through their own issues  but the dramatic bull**** doesn't eclipse all the awesome action. I hated Spiderman because Peter still looked like a dopey  love sick  puppy even when he was kicking some bad guy buttocks. This movie had the right balance of emotion and butt-kicking. The actors had such great chemistry! The scene after Johnny goes to the motocross contest was priceless. It was basically: This is how you bicker with superpowers. The scenes with the Thing adapting to life with big fingers was great. You can't just wake up one morning bigger than life and expect to be able to do everything normal. The scenes with Sue stripping down in the middle of the street were so true. Is there a better way to get away from a crowd than turning invisible and stripping off all your clothes? The little things like all of Johnny's clothes burning  the tabloids  the action figures  the way the Thing squeezed a huge bundle of oranges for his juice in the morning  all those things make this movie great.When you see the Fantastic 4  it's like you're watching 4 people's lives change through a hidden camera. They're doing their normal  everyday stuff... except with wicked cool powers.\tI have to say  I usually don't read Stan Lee comics. Nothing against them  just never got into them. So  for me  this movie going experience was my first trip into the world of the Fantastic Four  and it was a good time. Chris Evans  playing Johnny Storm  is superb as the cocky flamethrower and manages to steal just about every scene with his over-the-top flamboyance. Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba display good tension and chemistry from the moment they share a scene. No need to delve too much into the drama of their relationship  you see the way the two look at each other and you know there's a past. Gruffudd's performance is convincing (though it's obvious this guy is English  trying to use an American accent) and Alba  wow  what a sweet presence she adds to the screen. Obviously  she isn't hard on the eyes  but she carries herself in such a sensual way that you can't help but fall in love with her.I must say  the biggest disappointment I had was with Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom. He played his part well  but like the villains in Daredevil  he wasn't shown enough. He does play a great bad guy (of course  he is an evil businessman) but I didn't think they had enough tension build up between him and the FF. You knew he was gonna be po'ed about his business going under  so there was no chance for hostility to build  it was pretty much there once the failed experiment took place. And for a bad guy  he didn't have much of an agenda. He basically was trying to get back at the Fantastic Four  turn them against each other  but no bold plans for overtaking Manhattan  holding the world hostage  nothing. For an evil guy  he certainly didn't have many evil ambitions  which I find ironic  since he had been an adventurous entrepreneur. Makes you wonder.Michael Chiklis does a good job of playing a tormented thug. Man  if I had strength like that  I wouldn't be mopey  I'd be out there kicking the crud out of people  just for the fun of it. Chiklis was perfectly cast as The Thing  though I found it rather crass that his wife left him because he was deformed. I guess love doesn't last forever if your spouse becomes a mutant.As a whole  I pretty much got what I expected from this movie. Great special effects  good action (though not enough of it)  believable interaction between the characters  I give this one high marks. Not a bad movie to show to kids either (though it does show Alba briefly in her undergarments  oh ya). Just do yourself a favor: when you're watching it  suspend your disbelief  just for a short time. Let the special effects and the fun carry the way and don't over analyze things too much. No  seriously  don't do it.\tit's a movie worth watching i am a big fan of marvel comics and especially of the fantastic four i've been reading the comics since my childhood i was very disappointed that movies like daredevil flunk because it didn't fell real this movie felt real even when it 's totally not possible splendid action e real action story i hope they make a sequel th thing was cool but i hope they let it evolve more like in the comics.more \""punchlines\"" would be nice. X-men and x2 where great movies but i hope they can make an even better fantastic four next time.but as a film fan  this movie missed some things but that doesn't mean this movie ain't good. it's everything i expected and more.for every Melvin out there watch this movie.\tOf course i was ready to be disappointed after reading every critics in US harshly bashing this movie and all of the people involved in it - and of course i really should thank these so-called critics since i was pleasantly surprised with the result. F4 is OK  better than just OK; it's enjoyable - it has the simple clear fun comic book feeling of their creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby back in the 60's. and for me it was almost more than i hoped for in the first place. F4 is one of the best comic book adaptation so far. Only X MEN 2 and BATMAN RETURNS are superior  OK far superior; F4 is as good as X MEN and SPIDERMAN 2 and inches away above SPIDERMAN and BATMAN BEGINS. And please don't bother compare with DAREDEVIL  HULK or worse again ELEKTRA  CATWOMAN  THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN  SUPERMAN (yes  not all of the movies from the 70's were masterpieces)  SPAWN or THE PUNISHER as there are some of the worst movies ever made in any genre. I can understand that both critics and fans were dubious when heard about the chosen director of this project. Tim Story is no Bryan Singer Tim Burton  Christopher Nolan or even Joel Schumacher (sic!); he was in fact the director of 2 terrible idiotic movies. and Jessica Alba is no Michelle Pfeiffer or Halle Berry  Julian Mac Nahon is no Ian Mac Kellen  Ioan gruffud is no Patrick Stewart  Chris Evans is no Alan Cumming... i could go on and on with the different names attached to the project. But finally everyone involved did their job and they did a good job. The director is not as talented as Bryan Singer (he did such a wonderful job on x men 2!)that's for sure but he did a decent job though; the actors were pretty close to their character and Chilkis and Evans were particularly good. Even Alba did good. That's true she is way too young to play Sue but if you want to blame someone  blame our youth male oriented obsessed society; not the actress. The screenplay was fairly true to the essence of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby'comic books. anyway  hats off to everyone involved here and hopefully F4 will be as enjoyable as part one.\tThe trend of Marvel heroes being transferred from the comic books to the big screen continues with Tim Story's adaptation of the 'Fantastic Four'. By having an ensemble of popular TV actors rather then any big names  Story allows the audience to concentrate on the movie and the incredible special effects. The sexy Jessica Alba from Dark Angel and Sin City fame takes on the role of the Invisible girl and although the male audience will be disappointed to learn they'll hardly see Ms. Alba  rest assured when you do see her  the wait is worth it. To see Michael Chiklis from 'The Shield' as straight up 'good guy' is both strange and refreshing. Casting Chiklis as the 'The Thing' could have been considered as a risk but both the producers and Chiklis must be smiling to learn their gamble paid off and then some. Julian McMahon who plays the slick Dr. Troy in Nip/Tuck excels as the villainous electric Von Doom while on the other side of the intensity spectrum  Chris Evans dons the 'flame' of 'The Torch' and has the audience chucking with his witty  Ryan Reynolds-esquire performance. The enjoyable and atypical plot enables the audience to gradually learn about the characters  their powers and the emotions they endure as they come to terms with their fate. Even though the final confrontation between good and evil leaves a lot to be desired  one can't help feeling that this is a solid foundation to build a successful franchise on. With humour  incredible stunts and effects  'Fantastic Four' has something enjoyable for the whole family.\tI never read any Fantastic Four comics  so I cannot tell if the director followed with the comics or not  but all I can tell after watching the movie is that it's better than any MARVEL comics inspired movie that I'd seen (that includes Spiderman).The story has been intricately plot  and makes the characters certainly much better than the cartoon series  if not the comics(which I don't know about). The four guys plus Van Doom  their sponsor  go on a space mission to study human DNA better  but that mission goes haywire  as all of them get exposed to heavy radiation of an unknown kind.Next the story follows  how each of the five come to realize their own powers. Something which gives us more insight on the characters. Special focus is given on 'The Thing' as because of his hideous looks. Also the subtle romance between invisible Girl and Mr.Fanatastic is good to watch  but the action sequences are simply superb. The sequences about dodging the rockets  and the ones between the fight between Doom and Fantastic Four is also very well shot. Torchd is well portrayed as the flamboyant playboy  much like the original story.After watching the movie in the theater however  I realize that this is again a one time movie  just to give you a break from the monotonic day to day life. It doesn't stick to your heart like other movies. But no doubt it's still a great fun watching it. 8/10 from me...\tFollowing the recent wave of comic book films that began with 1978's Superman  Fantastic Four is another product of this fad. It is about a group of scientists going on an experimental voyage  which is standing in the way of a cosmic radiation storm. A few days after the accident  all of them discover that they have powers. Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic)  the leader  has the ability to stretch his body. Sue Storm  has the ability to be invisible (Invisible Woman)  Johnny Storm becomes the Flame  and Ben Grimm evolves into a muscular  rock-like creature knows ans the Thing. Together  they have to unite in order to combat Doctor DOOM  who  having witnessed the blast  becomes driven by greed as he discovers his ability to absorb electricity and metals.The movie is entertaining  with very good special effects  adequate doses of humour  and likable lead characters. The action sequences are well-placed and creative. But it is rather unoriginal by anyone's standard  a screenplay that borrows heavily from other previous Marvel films  and is rather dumb in content. This summer blockbuster leaves hardly anything to think about afterwards.The movie will never bore audiences and manages to stand out a bit from other contemporary releases. Summer 2005 has become a season where dark  violent action movies movies have become predominant-- i.e  Revenge of the Sith  Batman Begins  War of the Worlds--  .But nevertheless it lacks the authenticity of either such co-horts as well as previous comic book movies like the X-Men and Spiderman. Let's hope its sequel improves most of this movie's mistakes.** out of ****\tAs it was released more or less at the same time that \""Batman Begins\"" and \""War of the Worlds\""  I expected a bit of effort in this movie  in way to make it  if not interesting  at least entertaining. Well  no. It was neither the one nor the other. It's just a bad tale about five guys who fly out to space (for unimportant and basically unknown reasons  as if we all flew to space to make our picnics every weekend) who  due to an other unexplained failure  inexplicably turn to superheros  or to have superpowers in any case. The jokes are horrible. The plot is nowhere to be seen. The guys are hot (pheeew  one out of fifty!) and so is the girl (two out of fifty  then). The general impression is that someone had the idea of bringing Pixelart's \""The Incredibles\"" out to the big screen in flesh and blood  but managed to extraviate the screenplay in the way. There's this fashion of taking superhero/Marvel characters into the theaters  but I have to say  if YOU (general moan) are ever planning to film \""The Watchmen\"" or \""V for Vendetta\""  please restrict yourselves from doing a big mistake like this movie was. For that's what it is: a mistake.\tFantastic 4 is possibly the best movie based on comics that I have ever seen. It's not so different to this kind of movies  but I think it's more entertaining  amusing  that most of the rest.Well  I particularly didn't like very much the other super heroes movies  such as X Men  Spiderman  etc.  they are good movies  but they never caught my attention  something that Fantastic 4 has.The movie is well written  the plot is simple  and fast  the plot advances really quickly  so that the action parts are not so disconnected with the rest of the movie.It's really enjoyable  funny and smart  and at the same time  classic in some jokes or deeds  which makes the movie not so elaborated. If we are talking about the actors  well  they are very good  especially Michael Chiklis' part  but anyway  I don't know why having so many blonde actresses they had to find Jessica Alba and make her blond and blue eyes.Concluding  one more thing I'd like to say is that  you have to see Fantastic 4  no matter if you don't like this sort of movies; it's a totally enjoyable action movie for almost anyone(not just kids).\tAmong the very best of the comic book superhero movies  ranking up there with Spiderman and Batman Begins for quality. Casting was good  acting was adequate  special effects were tremendous. I hope my appreciation of the FX is not colored by how much superior they are to the 1994 dog of a flick directed by Roger Korman. Aside from the title  the two films have almost nothing in common. The plot line adheres to the comic book story very closely  with the only major difference being that of Dr. Doom being exposed to cosmic rays and changed along with our heroes. While a fairly major thing  this did not seriously detract from the film story. There were other miniscule departures  such as Ben Grimm being married  but these did not have a big impact on the plot. I have heard it said that the story was somewhat juvenile  to which i say  \""It's a comic book Superhero movie.\"" you aren't going to get Gone With the Wind  but you do get a fine and entertaining film. I haven't heard of anybody who thought that they wasted 8.50 by seeing it. Personally  I enjoyed it greatly  the film makers made the story come to life from the pages of Marvel Comics. Probably the best of the superhero movies from Marvel comics  and surpassed overall only by the magnificence of Batman Begins in all the comic book genre of films. I heartily recommend.8 out of 10\tI went into this movie with several expectations. 1: a great plot line with some well drawn characters we could care about. 2: excellent action. Duh-- not one  not two  but four superheroes and one of the great comic villains  Doctor Doom? and 3: outstanding visual effects  on a par with Spiderman. Well heck. The characters were okay. I liked Jessica Alba's no nonsense approach to Sue Storm  although she was a bit wooden when needing to be passionate. Ioan Gruffudd was good as Reed Richards. He somehow looks the part. Michael Chiklis performs well and is enjoyable as the Thing. Who is this Chris Evans guy? He was the best thing in the movie. Funny  a great sense of timing  a great sense of expression. He made the most out of his part and you could tell he enjoyed it. However  all the action was in the trailer  and the best performances and lines were too. I could go on and on about the movie's lackluster plot. The need for the characters to acclimatize to new situations was brunted by The Thing's angst over his physical changes  and the changes in his life wrought by his trip into space  disappearing in the matter of a second when his friends needed him to help them fight a boring evil Doom. Did we ever see a vicious plan hatched by Doom to endanger the lives of everyone in the city  or on the planet  or did it just seem like he done before he started? Same thing with the movie. Seemed like it was finished before anything we really could sink our teeth into appeared."""
Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children (2005),"I saw the movie  it looked amazing  and the cameos of the main characters were amazing. But there were some flaws also.For one  the characters were way underdeveloped. The only ones who were a part of the actual story were really Cloud  Tifa  Marlene  the kid Denzel  and Vincent. All the others  Yuffie  Cid  Barret  Red XIII  and Cait Sith were mainly cameos for fanservice. Square tried to portray a down-draught Cloud who feels he can't fix things  or save anyone  after the effects of geostigma  but it wasn't a very strong development at all  even when he somehow gained a bit of fighting confidence back later on in the movie when he faces off with Ultimate Weapon and Kadaj and Sephiroth. Tifa remained the same busty girl who tries to talk some sense into Cloud from the game  so there was no development there. Because of this serious underdeveloped tone  the movie felt very short  despite the fact that it was a feature-length 90 minutes. Should Square have worked on character development  it would have set a very nice pace for the movie  in lay with all the high-octane action.Another flaw  was that the illness called Geostigma  wasn't explained very clearly. It seemed to me that the illness deteriorated at the health of those who carried it. Though Cloud carried it  it only seemed to make his arm go crazy and give him migraines. But that was it. This should have been fixed and defined clearly by Square.Another note to point out  just where did Kadaj and his gang erect from? Sure  they're Sephiroth clones  but just exactly where did they come from? That wasn't clearly defined either in the film.Also  people who have never ever played the game before will never understand the goings-on happening in the movie. This film was clearly meant for fans of the game. Those who have never played the game shouldn't even touch it. If you're gonna watch it for the CG  then be my guest.The fight scenes  though they packed a ton of punch in them  some of them were too zoomed in to actually noticed what was happening. Were they flipping or were they spinning in 720 degrees x 2? It was hard to tell without wanting to pause to snapshot the frame. But those minor setbacks didn't do much to take away from the excitement of the characters jumping around and slicing everything up.This movie had many things going for it. It was the most highly anticipated release for Square-Enix  but it wasn't much what I expected  only because some things needed to be worked on  and there could have been so much more added to it. It could easily have been a 3-hour film that had good character development  great fight scenes  fixed camera angles that made more sense than zoom-ins  and a clear explanation to why Geostigma was such a dreadful disease  therefore creating a more directed purpose in the plot.However  despite all that  it was still a visual turkey feast for Final Fantasy fans and CG-lovers alike. Fans shouldn't be disappointed that it looks this amazing and keeps the action high in your seats. I would gladly buy it and add it to my collection.\tYes I AM a FF7 fan  but how many people who watch this movie are NOT going to be? And so  I'm reviewing this movie from a FF7 fan perspective  and with no regret. (I would not know how to adequately review the movie for someone who has not played the FF7 game.)Visuals - 10/10 I loved Advent Children. It's a sensory delight - a complete audio-video overload. The visuals were breathtaking: some feats were accomplished that I would simply have not quite thought possible with an animated feature. When the action scenes came about  they were  for lack of a more accurate word  a roller-coaster. With dramatic camera movement sweeping across from range to range  to seamlessly integrated bullet-time effects at the crucial moments  to the sheer level of detail - it's all hard to fault. The animation looks big budget  the style and imagery is awesome  and the effects at times made me forget that I was watching animation rather than live action footage. I could ramble on for hours repeating myself on the fantastic quality of the visuals  but it simply wouldn't do it any justice.Sound - 10/10 The sound was fabulous. The voices for all the characters didn't disappoint (no one sounded silly) and the sound effects were bold and sharp. The music - from the game that (in my opinion) had the best game soundtrack EVER  transfered beautifully to the movie. Most of the memorable themes from the game are present in the movie  albeit often using different instruments to fit in better with what's going on. There was some bolder rock and slight thrash metal music over the really intense action scenes from time to time  but it all fitted in well with the movie's situation at the corresponding time.Story - 7/10 The story and characters would be the main flaws of the movie. Both aspects were simply not up to par with the game - but then again  the game could spend 40+ hours developing these points - the movie only has about 90 minutes. As far as the story goes  the plot wasn't bad or anything  but just not as ambitious as was expected from someone who played the game through. In effect  the plot seemed rather weak in comparison. The game was so extravagant with the intricate plot twists and story progression/development  that the movie never really stood a chance to compete in the same league. Instead  the movie took the more sensible approach - to expand on the action and try to place as many inside-jokes and themes into itself instead of trying to impossibly recreate the massive story factor  which was originally such a driving force in the game. The lack of Materia usage also caused me some controversy - the story of the movie chose to use little (though not ZERO) Materia  and instead lots of supernatural fighting ability and skill. I would hope that if a sequel was made it would incorporate Materia much much more extravagantly and importantly into the film. There were also many plot holes in the movie - all which can be forgiven if you think of Advent Children as a random anime  but seem ridiculous when you realise how it was based on a game that executed plot tremendously well.Characters - 7/10 The characters  whilst all being present in one form or another  don't necessarily shine to their true potential. There simply isn't really enough movie-time to spend with all of them. And so  all of their background stories and abilities are not entirely showcased  and in some cases  barely at all (Red and Cait Sith leave absolutely no real lasting impressions). Even Cloud  who is the focal point of the movie  I feel doesn't use enough of his familiar abilities from the game. The Materia issue is a strong reason for this. With that said  it's a joy to see the cast back in action  even if it's in such a role that doesn't utilise them to their fullest. The new characters were the ones that caused me most of the strife however - the Bad Guy Trio and the kid dude Denzel - there was a huge lack of explanation about any of them. Anyone willing to use their imagination can probably fill in the blanks with something reasonable and be done with it  but objectively speaking the issue is still there to be commented on and is therefore a little disappointing.Value - 10/10 The replay value for this movie is excellent - I personally want to watch it again in a more bigger and louder way - bigger screen  louder volume.Enjoyment - 10/10 Whatever the flaws of the movie  they simply weren't big enough to hinder my enjoyment of it  and I honestly think that will be the same case for most people. I enjoyed Advent Children tremendously  and encourage fellow FF7 fans to go see it.\tWhen Final Fantasy 7 emerged on gaming-shelves around the globe  causing panic since it jumped from number three to seven magically  it took us all by storm for many reasons. The depth in the story  the many branching side-quests and diverse characters not to mention a very cool battle-system. As soon as we had completed it once  we did it a second time and then patiently waited for a sequel of some sort.This review may contain spoilers so beware if you do not want to find out something now that you might want to see later.Now  that sequel has finally arrived in the form of Advent Children  a huge project taking years to finish  both enraging and teasing fans. And the long work paid off very well  unless it's a close-up on the face of people you don't really know it's computer  unfortunately it's painfully clear when you're up in their faces but we all knew what to expect.It becomes clear only a while into the movie that all the money was spent on the graphics rather than a decent script and hiring better voice-actors. The story is torn and not complete at all  for those of us with a decent knowledge of FF7 nothing comes as a surprise and for those who haven't even played the game everything is a huge question mark. Of course  that only applies for half the movie since the last half doesn't really contain anything else but nice fighting-scenes. Albeit the fights are incredible  they're just too incredible.To lure fans in they quickly use some of the characters. Personally I was a hardcore Vincent-fan and a big admirer of Cid's rapid yet dirty mouth and it was a bit of a shame to find out they had taken a back row-seat to some of the lesser characters. Rude and Reno are given a strong  comedian style which brings out a lot of laughs and they're really the highlight of the movie  their chemistry is well worked out and works very nicely on screen.Another trick they use making this movie is the recycled music. Hearing the old tunes could've been a nice memory but after hearing it over and over again  both soundtrack and in the game  some might have gotten a bit tired of them  me for instance. Hoping for some new blood instead of dragging on something that should be left sleeping in its' glory they instead recycle the whole game; characters  music and a similar plot.To me this is a movie that I will gladly watch again when I'm in the mood for something completely brainless and really fancy. For those who haven't played the game this is really just a long waste of time  the movie spans one and a half hour which is definitely more than enough to bore most. For those into deep story and well thought out dialog  this is not your kind of movie as I think that throughout out those 90 minutes  they talk perhaps ten in total. For you who have played the game  knock yourselves out but don't expect the depth from the game to come along. Shallow but pretty... that's how I'd summarize this movie extremely quickly.\tWell its finally here and the wait is over and I have to say I think the wait has definitely been worth it. The film as has already been stated leaves off pretty much where the game left us.The stunning visuals and cool voice acting (the Japanese version) make this film an absolute must see. If you enjoyed the game then I would be very surprised if you didn't like this film. The fight sequences run at a terrific pace and the action is excellent as well.This film really is something that should be checked out by everyone even non-Final Fantasy VII fan although to fully appreciate the in-jokes you really do have to have played the games. Quite simply this is what Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within should have been like.All in all this film is fantastic and I'm sure you won't be left disappointed. Go out there and get it!!\tSquare really landed this one. They didn't try to please everyone and instead focused exclusively on Final Fantasy 7 fans. And boy  are those going to be happy fans when they see this movie! The story might not be all that interesting or credible but it ties in neatly with the story of the game and has several honest-to-god funny moments!! A total surprise there and a welcome one tooThere are lots of cameos and funny references to the game too. And most important of all: The fighting scenes rock so hard they could cut through diamond! They are truly the total awesomeness and would have made the movie worth it even if everything else sucked. I mean  they are some of the best ever created PERIOD.See this movie. Bye.PS: I know my review sounds like the ravings of a teenage girl. It was  like  totally what I intended.\tI shall begin with a disclaimer: This movie is NOT recommended for anyone who lack interest or have never played FF7 the game before watching. The movie relies on the audience's knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements. And it does so very subtly. Do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of CG film and I promise it'll be that much better.With that in mind  this film has some of the most spectacular CG sequences I have ever witnessed. The whole experience felt like an extra long FMV sequence from the game  on steroids. Yeah. The attention to detail in each scene  especially in the heavy action oriented ones  is so impeccable it left me with a sense of awe.I believe the soundtrack is simplified so as to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music. Again  for those who are familiar with the FF7 story and background  the music should not surprise anyone (although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animation).Once again  I myself having only played through FF7 once  thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from Square Enix. And that is the feel in most scenes  choreographed and organized. Like a dance.In short  if you enjoyed the music or the game Final Fantasy 7  this film will blow you out of the water. If you're in the unfortunate majority who has not experienced the goodness known as FF7 on Playstation or PC  doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experience.Finally  I just want to make a note of the quality in animating this film. Characters move with fluidity. Each scene background comes to life and tells its own story. For those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot  I urge you to reexamine the animation. Facial reactions  subtle clues that bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery.Square Enix and the great Tetsuya Nomura has set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling. Advent Children has ushered in a new era for CG animations  allowing the subtleties that lie in each character to speak volumes in and of themselves.Thanks Square Enix. The wait was well worth it.\tI put spoilers in the title to deter those who haven't watched the movie from reading this. That being said  there's really not much to spoil. This movie is SO devoid of plot it's rather sad  seeing as the original Final Fantasy VII that caused so many to flock to the genre of role playing games had a rather good one. The movie lacks character development  explanations  and also is rather clich\u00e9 and predictable.However  I loved it.Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is a series of cool moments  with fight scenes that make Agent Smith's mouth gape in awe. The most beautiful CG in existence compliments all this  accompanied by what may just be Nobuo Uematsu's last real work for SquareEnix. The characters are  for the most part  voiced well  and  for what they are  they're all rather enjoyable. So let's go through the movie  and again  thar be spoilers: We get Cloud  which was pretty obvious to everyone. He's got a motorcycle  a slight change in clothing  and a NEATO sword which he can attach all his different swords to. The thing about Cloud in this film is that  as a character  he takes a step back. He's despondent  an enigma  and very much a loner in the first portion of Final Fantasy VII  and then he learns that he is not alone. Apparently the disease that Cloud contracts causes amnesia  as he learns it all over again.We're also introduced early on to our main protagonists: Yazoo  Loz  and Kadaj. Yazoo and Loz are henchmen  essentially  and rather unimportant aside from the fact that they have awesome fight scenes (and hey  like I said  aside from the awesome fight scenes  there IS nothing important in this film). Kadaj is  apparently  a clone of Sephiroth. Or of Jenova. Or he's been created by the Lifestream.To be honest  one of the main problems with this film's lack of plot is the fact that we don't get to care about these villains. When Kadaj dies  we're supposed to feel for him... but where did he come from? What's his motivation? He \feels\"" Sephiroth? That's not enough. Give these guys an origin. This movie could've done with another hour of setup.Aside from that  they're all three very cookie-cutter villains. They kidnap some children (the aforementioned children of the Advent variety)  one of whom Cloud and Tifa know (but of course  he's not really explained)  turn them into zombies  and then Tifa makes them not zombies. They also kidnap Marlene  who's sole role in the movie is to care more about Cloud and Tifa than her \""father \"" Barrett.Tifa's our secondary main character. She begins as a major player in the beginning  taking on Loz (or perhaps it was Yazoo? Again  lack of character development) by herself  and then she falls into the background with AVALANCHE.Yes  every member of AVALANCHE appears in some form  even my personal favorite  Cait Sith. Aside from Vincent  however  they all seem to be pretty much cameos. The sad part about this is that most of the fans won't care. They're here to see Cloud and Aerith and Sephiroth and Reno  not Cid and Yuffie and Barrett. The team members get in one good (REALLY good) fight scene  and then they're relegated to the background.We're also treated to the Turks  Reno and Rude. Outside of the battles  they're essentially the best part of the movie. Unlike Cloud  they have character  they have emotion. Reno's face has to be the most animated face in the entire movie. They're working for Rufus  who is inexplicably alive following his really amazing death in-game. Rufus' motivations or actions are never really explained  making his return seem rather pointless  another loose end that will probably never be addressed.In the end  Cloud fights everyone  Kadaj becomes Sephiroth  and Cloud beats him. Then Cloud almost dies  but Aerith talks to him and he doesn't. Then everyone laughs. The end. Predictable schlock? Totally. But man  them some pretty graphics  no? To supplement my point  here are some of the coolest points in the film: - Cloud using a limit break (the super Climhazard during the Bahamut battle being my favorite).Cid being the only one other than Cloud to really land any good shots on Bahamut.Rude's glasses. Classic! - Rufus's fight scene. Perhaps the one part of the film that had me jumping out of my seat.Loz's ringtone.The fight with Sephiroth.Pretty much any of the fights (which was about 3/4 of the movie).Like I said  it's pretty  it's fast-paced  and it is INCREDIBLY fun. It's a really good movie.It's just not great.\tbut the sad thing is... not many others will understand it. Being a sequel to the old Final Fantasy 7 game  the story is already set and as such those who don't know anything about the game are likely to be more than confused. think of it as watching *Lord of the Rings: The Two towers* without checking out the two others. you'll be missing half the fun because the movie makes a ton of references to the game... and that goes for characters  locations and storyline. in fact the only new main characters introduced in the movie are a new gang consisting of Kadja  Loz and Yahoo... but even their part in the tale is confusing if you don't know the story well enough beforehand.with that said how was the movie u might ask... one word: AWESOME. I'm pleased to say that this lived up to ALL my expectations. being a fan of the game did i expect a new revolutionary storyline with an exceptional twist? of course not. all i wanted was to see my favorite characters in action on screen. And the way it looked and the action... WOW. no wonder it took so damn long to make because the action scenes are absolutely breathtaking. blink for a second and you're likely to miss out on whats happening. i think that around 70-75% of the movie consists of action alone ranging from fist fights  chase sequences on motorcycle  gun fights and sword swinging. so yeah  the total package is included. everything is detailed in this movie: hair and clothes sway in the wind  the numerous expression on the character's faces... everything!before i come off as another fanboy let me address the issues i have with this movie and how many newcomers would think about this movie. character development: newcomers will definitely point out the lack of character development and the introduction of too many characters which seemingly serve no purpose whatsoever which only adds to the confusion... but the only thing i can say to this is that these characters are all from the game and as such their introductions have already been made and we already know each of their personalities. fans definitely know who barrett  vincent  yuffie  cid  and redXIII are while newcomers would describe them as *man with machine gun  red lion with his tail on fire* etc. a personal gripe i have with this movie is the lack of on screen time for many of my favorites. i was thrilled when i saw all the familiar faces joining together battling evil... only to realize after that scene was over we wouldn't be watching them in action again which is really sad.story: first of all the story only seems like a setup for all the action. if i remember correctly the trailers seemed to emphasize the importance of children but the more i watched the more the movie seemed to drift away from that purpose even though the movie is called Advent Children. second of all  as said before  the story is very confusing for those who haven't played the game. the result of this is that many people will consider the movie to be all eyecandy and no substance whatsoever while they still forget that the story has *already* been set.Think about this though... WHY was the movie created? was it to draw in a new audience or was it to satisfy old  loyal fans who still consider the game to be one of the best RPG's created? the producers already knew the movie was gonna be a hit... the fanbase was already set and any newcomers who would be attracted to the movie was probably just considered as a bonus.some might think of it as a cheap popcorn flick... but others like me will find a copy of this movie resting nicely besides my old  old copy of final Fantasy 7 for the PS1.8/10\tIn 1997 Square co  Ltd released the RPG Final Fantasy VII on the Sony Playstation. The game had many fine qualities but what stuck out the most for first time RPG'rs was the intense storyline.Starting with what appeared to be a terrorist assault on a government power station  players soon found themselves tied up in a secret government conspiracy leading to the creation of a man so filled with hate he'd like nothing better than the total destruction of the planet.Add to this a detailed storyline for each of the playable characters and even sub story's for some of the lesser characters  what you got was a story of almost epic proportions that lasted almost 45 hours.And now after eight years  sixteen Final Fantasy or Final Fantasy related game releases and one mediocre movie Square have released Final Fantasy: Advent Children.Set two years after FFVIII ended Advent Children is a for the most part seems to be way for the main character Cloud Strife to work through some guilt issues left over from the video game  and hardcore fans will thrill to the amazingly over the top battle scenes set to pumping remixes of the original tunes but underneath the story presented is actually original and fun enough for your common anime fan to sit down and enjoy.There are little flashback's to keep newcomers up-to date on whats going on but anyone who can sit and watch Evangelion or Akira or any of the numerous confusing anime's on the market will have no trouble with this. In fact if you like bright colours  loud music and scrapping your not gonna be disappointed.The CGI is stunning to watch. In Spirit's within *sigh* it was used to create a lifelike feel in all things  here nothing is trying to prove itself  it's CGI so the character's can move in a way that wouldn't be possible in real life  that's what its for and thats what it's used for. The music also deserves very special mention as this was always a big part of the original game. Nobuo Uematsu has done an amazing job remixing some tunes  merely fleshing out others and leaving some exactly as they were meant to be.Overall Advent Children is for me a sigh of relief to see the Final Fantasy name slapped on a film worthy of the title  and i recommend this movie to Fans  Anime lovers and when the English (<--insert your language here) version is released  everyone who likes a good action flick.\tTwo years after the end of Final Fantasy VII the world is starting to get back on it's feet and is working towards a new future. However  there is a new threat from a new illness called Geo-stigma  and three men that seem to be seeking Jenova. Cloud and his friends from the original game must once again reunite to combat the new threat.A great movie! Definitely watchable of all ages. No gore. Many action scenes. One of the best game that turn into a great movie sequel note: You have to at least know the game Final Fantasy VII before actually watching the film so that you won't be confuse and you'll know what it's all about. Anyway  if you want to play the game it's still the best out there.\t(For fans of FFVII  you might as well ignore my comments  because you'll want to see AC anyway  and nothing I say should stop you.) It's been 8 years since the release of the landmark game that has since made FF a household name. Since then FFVII has garnered a legion of fans far outnumbering those of us who were fans pre-FFVII. Square-Enix has finally given those fans what they've been asking for  but was it worth the wait? If you're looking for eye-candy  then look no further. AC is abound with vast amounts of it. So much  in fact  that it becomes one of its greatest detriments. The problem is that Square-Enix overuses the CG and attempts to bring everything to life  so much so that you find yourself looking at the details instead of the whole picture.The biggest problem with this lies in the voice acting and facial expressions. Square-Enix has come a long way since the original CG in FFVII  but they still have a long way to go with merging CG with recorded voice acting. The voice acting is good  but it doesn't sync perfectly with the emotion of the visuals  so it gives the characters a hollow feel. Words come out of the characters  but they don't seem to come FROM the characters  and so it becomes very distracting.In addition to that  many of the characters' movements seem unnatural and puppet-like  most notably the children. It seems like great care was taken to animate Cloud  but they just signed off on minor characters to people who didn't have enough time to do it properly  so you get a totally uneven feel.The other big problem is with direction. Directing a game is different than directing a feature. In games  you need to fill almost all silence with ambient music to keep the player from getting bored. Scenes without music tend to heighten the tone. In features  too much music will drown out any tone set by the characters. Unfortunately  AC was directed from a gaming perspective  so the whole thing is almost completely saturated with music.In all  AC is an interesting piece of work. Despite feeling let down by the production  I was still entertained. I just can't help but feel that with a movie director and more advances in technology  they could've made something more that wasn't just for the die-hard fans.\tNow after watching The Advent Children twice  the storyline isn't as shallow as majority has criticized it to be in my opinion. If you haven't played FFVII or disliked it for whatever reason  this movie is most likely not for you. Being familiar to the original story is a prerequisite to understanding AC fully  otherwise you will just see the greatest CG animation in your life so far.Without actually spoiling the storyline  I must admit that after seeing AC we have been putting pieces together with my friends relying on our knowledge of FFVII. Seeing it second time allowed to actually pay attention to the story more and most of the questions we may have had were answered. Some were not. AC is clearly for FFVII players/fans and doesn't honestly try to be anything else. There is little to none realism in it outside FFVII world which serves the purpose. Music is mostly reconstructed FFVII themes with a heavier touch (TBM team according to end credits) and works well with the eye candy without exceptions. I found the music enhancing the experience added to the visual fireworks in all situations.We all know you can't put a FFVII in 1.5 hours and keeping that in mind the storyline actually offered more to me than I expected. There are two issues at hand in FFVII : AC and both stories were wrapped up very smoothly between the action sequences. And trust me when I say there's a lot of it. Action that is.I'm changing my vote from 9 to 10 after watching it the second time because I had missed a few explanatory sequences I couldn't put together the first time that provided some answers. As a warning  it's going to be easy to disregard the story and concentrate on graphics  but try not to judge the Adevent Children because of that. If you don't let the story in  it's no wonder it seems sloppy.I'm not going to praise the graphics because I assume we all know they are awesome  which might be an understatement. Especially characters talk so much more with their facial expressions than ever before. I hope you pay attention to the storyline for it actually makes sense and works well with the whole. Get ready for the ride of your life  there are no breaks.\tTwo words for this movie  \""It sucks\"". The story isn't as good as I was expecting and the story is more like one of another \""no I don't want to fight\"" kinda thing  so common nowadays. Most of the characters animation are only based on those beautiful Japanese people where wrinkles are not on their dictionary. I just don't see why people said that this movie's good. I was expecting more and more  but this movie just doesn't live up to it's name. The animation is good  but not great. The animation is just too soft and too white. There really is no deep texture of skin  wrinkles  etc. The eyes are all almost the same  and they're such cute eyes  really really beautiful   .......total and complete tat. The story is  yeah  OK  whatever. really  I jus"
Finding Neverland (2004),"Johnny Depp  after this movie  is now my favorite actor. All his movies  he looks different  acts different  and even speaks differently. In his movies  I am just totally shocked. He never seizes to amaze me.This movie is on my top 10 favorite movies. But  some of his other movies are also on my top 10.The movie makes you think  that there is a kid in everybody  even grown ups. Being a kid doesn't give you the right to an imagination  it's who you are that gives you that right. In this movie  Johnny Depp  playing Sir James was given the privilege. He shows everybody what a little imagination can do.To parents  you will be influenced. To the children  you will know what the truth is behind this. Although  I'm being a hypocrite  seeing parents will probably also know the truth behind the movie.Movie  I would give it a 10.\tThis is a terrific film. In a time when Hollywood makes just utter garbage films  this stood out and made me laugh  cry  and think. Johnny Depp is extremely good and so are the children. Biggest flaw was the ending. It's not enough that people die and go to a fictitious 'Neverland'. All of us must continue to search for what lies ahead after death. Do heaven and hell exist? This is always avoided in cinema and that's a cop out. Nevertheless  terrific film and one that is outside of Hollywood's horrible movies these days. Other great films in search of the hereafter are 'Ben Hur'  'Million dollar Baby'  'Field of Dreams'  etc. In all  I think 'Finding NEverland' will hold a place in history  but it still lacked the substantive depth of what happens when we die.\tI just saw this film for the first time last night and was quite pleasantly surprised. Overwhelmingly so in fact. Knowing a little bit about the true history of Sir J.M. Barrie and yet comparatively little about \Finding Neverland\"" other than its Oscar hoopla  I expected the film to focus largely on the often controversial life of a man deemed capricious  anomic  and asexual by many historians  with the inception of Peter Pan as a backdrop perhaps. Instead the film celebrates Barrie's brilliant vision of what would become a timeless tale and cultural staple for the ages  and the power of imagination that we all possess and  if willing  are able to unleash. It celebrates the whimsical  the eccentric  and the \""silliness\"" which make life  even in the stilted atmosphere of Victorian London  worth living. The film is both an artistic period piece and a rich character study (though not a biography)  and features some of the best and most convincing performances from child actors in recent memory. Depp is brilliant as usual and Dustin Hoffman as his tightly wound producer/financier also makes for one of the more enjoyable  though secondary  characters to watch. The film starts somewhat slowly but seamlessly evolves into an engrossing and emotionally engaging story which unlike many other critically acclaimed dramas wrought of style over substance  is unquestionably worthy of its high praise. It has both the substance  as well as a style all its own  and should make even the most jaded and cynical viewer well up a little bit. 9/10\tIt depicts the life of J.M. Barrie and his inspiration for Peter Pan. The ending is beautiful  and whoever doesn't think Freddie Highmore is the most adorable sad-looking little boy on the planet has issues. I loved this movie  though admittedly I didn't see it until well after it came out on DVD. The set is amazing  the lighting fantastic  and the script well-written. It has it's humorous parts as well as it's share of tears. It combines the youthful joys of a timeless classic and the story of the man behind it all in an artistic new way. Johnny Depp does an exceptional job  as does Kate Winslett  Julie Christie  Dustin Hoffmann  Radha Mitchell  as well as all the new faces brought to real fame in the film. It's a great movie for the entire family  and I highly recommend that if you haven't seen this  you need to hightail it to your nearest Blockbuster!\tSuffering from severe flu I did not care what was on the DVD last night.Finding Neverland was a movie I knew little about and only the fact that two of my favourite actors  Johhnny Depp and Kate Winslet  starred in it led me to have any interest.Of course I knew well the Story of Peter Pan and had read the book myself and to my own children.But of J.M. Barrie I knew almost nothing. After the first fifteen to twenty minutes that it took me to settle into the world of James Barry comfortably  learn that he had a Scottish accent  accept that he slipped between the real and imaginary worlds with ease  and I was transported to another place.A gentle world that brought back to me my own childhood experiences and flights of fancy. I am no expert just a lover of movies and watch as many as I can.I cant remember a better film  a better performance than Johnny Depps and the young boy who played Peter.How on earth could a young child have the insight and intensity to convey what he did.Truly an amazing performance. No violence no sex no bad language.Wonderful sets and costumes  finely written dialogue brilliant acting cameos in the minor roles.I have no criticisms.It just got better and better. As for the last half an hour.I had stopped coughing for the first time in two days as I watched spellbound  but the tears that flowed as I felt so many tender and sad and wonderful things nearly choked me. Don't miss this film.Stay with it for the first 15 to 20 minutes and let yourself relax into a gentler time and the world of Never land. I'm going to watch it again today   and tomorrow....\tThis is a wonderful movie. I can't recommend it highly enough. You don't have to be a fan of Peter Pan to enjoy it either. It's just a great story with terrific period costume thrown in and a wonderful theme as well. It is certainly appropriate for some younger viewers as there is no sex  no violence and lots of neat scenes depicting J.M. Barrie's staged plays and looks inside his Imagination. It also deals with the issue of death in a very mature way without being maudlin at all and without delivering platitudes  religious or otherwise -- and also without talking down to children (the Davies boys have recently lost their father when the movie opens)\tThis movie is seriously boring. Seriously. I know it's meant to be magical and inspiring and fun. But it's not. Then again  if you like Depp and Winslet  if you don't mind Julie Christie reappearing from the grave  if you have no problem with some wooden English boys trying to act  if you think a story-line can be made out of sticks and if you think 'magic' consists of a fluffy fat dog on stage and a guy dancing with his dog  then by all means  go and see it. If you think you will get a Tim Burton dish  you're wrong. Depp has long since lost my vote. Never mind Winslet. The young promising English actor boy... all the best to him but I get the Culkin-Haley-Osment-shivers already (lay off of those kids !). I hope I do not sound bitter. It's just that I expected so much more. And it was not delivered. If you are like me and you watched this movie  you will know what I mean...\tI expected this movie to be like Hook or even Bewitched (of course not as bad as bewitched). I expected it artificially recreate the original into a lame real life interpretation  but I found to the contrary I enjoyed the story of Barrie  the playwright  to be even more amazing than Pan himself. It does help that it was Depp playing Barrie.I have yet to find an actor who can add that element of whimsical mystique  as can also be seen in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  so characteristic of Depp. Not mention the elegance that only Kate Winslet can bring to the screen would doing the movie injustice. The movie would have suffered had it been any other actress.\tTo review a film like Finding Neverland  rather to APPRECIATE a film like Finding Neverland  you have to know what it sets out to accomplish. It's clear that Marc Forster  along with practically everybody involved with the production  has a deep connection to J.M. Barrie's play. Because of this  it accurately depicts J.M. Barrie's life. Are there a few \""poetic license\"" liberties taken? Naturally. As we all know  real life is simply not that interesting. Forster's direction is amazing. The coordination with the cinematographer  along with his usage of grace notes (the tainting of the tea is brilliant) is perhaps the film's strongest points. The score  winner of the Oscar  is brilliant: whimsical while melancholy. The performances are subdued  yet they still qualify as exceptional. Some on this board have criticized Johnny Depp. Most on this board are not bona fide film critics  nor am I. Even so  Mr. Depp gave an intricately laced performance  complete with a terrific dialect  while refraining from eccentric mannerisms. Winslet and Julie Christie are charming and  in the case of the latter  somehow lovable by the end. Hoffman is his usual terrific self  and the newcomer Freddie Highmore delivers a breakthrough performance. The film's only weak spot is the very thing that makes it fantastic. This film will probably make you cry. I did. My family did. We all did. Some may feel manipulated into crying  and in a sense you ARE. Even so  Forster succeeded in making you cry or at the very least feel an overwhelming sense of awe and beauty. Not many films that I can think of  and I'm really racking my brain here  have been able to derive tears from sheer beauty rather than manipulated guilt. In closing  this is a professionally done  admirable  beautiful film. It has its detractors  but I'd presume many of them are just too emotionally closeted to reveal their inner child. And revealing ones inner child is exactly what Finding Neverland does. Perfectly.\tJohnny Depp is on a winning streak with me! I thought this film was Amazing!! I went to see it with friends and we were warned that it might make us cry. Annd of course I ignored that since films don't really make me cry easily.But come a certain moment in the film  I found myself actually crying! And I do mean I FOUND myself crying... I didn't even notice I was until I looked over at my friend who was bawling her eyes out!!It wasn't just Depp though  I thought all the main actors did a really great job  especially the \""Peter.\"" I'll attribute my tears to his performance. The film in general was also great! I think whoever wrote the screenplay did a good job of visually representing how someone's imagination works and how we're actually brought into the world that's created.\tOne of the strengths in this movie about the author of Peter Pan is that no characters are so exaggerated put to screen that they couldn't have existed. Emma du Maurier is not an over-evil character; she gives Barrie a difficult time  but has her reasons and in the end even apologizes. Barrie is instructed to be cautious in his relation with the Davies' family at the cricket match in a subtle way. Mary supports her husband to a great extent despite their problems. In Disney's hands there would be no hesitation to remove this balance in story and characters. Note also however that the actual story around the Davies' family and Barrie is completely different and almost the opposite of what is portrayed here.The writing of Peter Pan  inspired by the Davies' family  offers Barrie a way to deal with his marriage trouble at home and a suffocating British society in general. Parallel we have Peter's coping with his father's death to be the reason he starts writing  inspired by Barrie. When Peter's play is performed  the upcoming illness of his mother throws him back from his imagined world to the real world. The scene in the end with the entering of Neverland is the best in the movie  especially the quick edit after-wards.The direction is a relatively weak point as Marc Forster (Monster's Ball) could have used some more imagination on a story about the power of imagination. Yes  he weaves in real and imagined images  but that's the only (visual) trick on offer.Johnny Depp is building a whole new career with sugary movies: Chocolat  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and this sugar sweet one. It is an enormous contrast with the wild roles he took on some years earlier.Finding Neverland is a decent movie  see it if it's the kind of story you generally appreciate.\tWhile browsing around the video store  I came across this movie which I've heard much acclaim about but had no true interest in viewing. But then so small voice said go ahead and pick-it-up  so I did just that maybe sometimes its good to listen to the voices in your head  this one lead me to a purchase a movie  which took me on a journey. To that magical  mystical land that all of us have dreamed of one day finding. This movie is not at all a remake of the same old story of the boy who never grow up. No  this is a story about how that story came to be. In a wonderful fashion Finding Neverland takes you on that journey  and you don't even know that your going  but by some magic you a whisked away into that world of endless summers of your youth. When this ride is over Neverland will be there before you  and around you will be those carefree days of yesteryear. OK maybe this is a bit dramatic. But some how after watching this movie I felt an urge to write. To sum this up if you have yet to discover Finding Neverland  you are missing an adventure and an opportunity  to escape into  what I would call  one great movie.\tSir James Matthew Barrie (Johnny Depp) was surrounded by stuffy rich English people who had no use for imagination. As he got involved with Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her sons  he began to imagine them flying and fighting pirates  and thus got the idea to write \""Peter Pan\"".Usually  fantasies are kind of boring  but they did a really good job with it here. More than feel-good treacle  we get to see how Barrie became disenchanted with England's stuffy culture and was inspired to write \""Peter Pan\"". The fact that Johnny Depp did a very good job with a Scottish accent only strengthens the movie. Interesting support also comes from Julie Christie as Sylvia's mother Emma du Maurier  and Dustin Hoffman as James' friend Charles Frohman.All in all  this is what fantasy should be. Splendid.\tWhen we grow up  we cannot think like we were children. We are losing the ability of imagination. The exhausted writer James was in sagging spirits. When he met the family of widow Sylvia  he refreshed himself. Through playing with the children  he got much inspiration. Finally he wrote a well-known work.The interaction between James and the kids was the best part in the movie. Every time I laughed as if I came back my childhood. In fact from a child you can learn much. The kids can be good examples for us. They are full of imagination.The final part was unforgettable. When sick Sylvia watched the Neverland  the splendid place also touched my heart deeply. I think everyone has one's Neverland. If you really want it  it will come to you.I think that Johnny Depp was the most appropriate man for the role. His character was fully in accordance with the role. His acting was impeccable. Kate Winslet also brought us wonderful performance. As similar subject  FN was better than Peter Pan (2003)  Hook (1991).One of the best movies in 2004. 9/10\tHow fine is the line between fantasy and reality? And if we unleash our imaginations  just how far will they take us? These are two questions explored by Marc Foster's beautiful \""Finding Neverland.\"" JM Barrie is a lonely author stuck in a loveless marriage to a social-climbing wife and a suffocating world of adult primness until he finds creative muses \u0096 four of them  to be exact \u0096 in young brothers George  Jack  Peter  and Michael Davies. Though he also strikes up an instant friendship with their beautiful widowed mother Sylvia (Kate Winslet)  it is clear that her sons are the real magnet. With his powerful imagination  Barrie creates a series of magical adventures for the boys ... until Sylvia's failing health and eventual death intrude upon their world of make-believe.The weepy scenes are many  but there are definitely laughs in-between. In one scene  Barrie is asleep in bed with a tuft of blondish hair under the covers beside him  assumed to be his wife until the covers are thrown back to reveal his brilliant pet dog  Porthos. (Besides changing his breed from St. Bernard to Newfoundland  the movie took almost no liberties with Porthos.) Earlier  Barrie commands Porthos to stand on his hind legs  takes hold of his paws  and says in the most passionate  serious voice  \""Dance with me!\"" I don't know how Johnny Depp did it without laughing! The two share a merry waltz in the middle of the park. Throughout the film  Depp's Barrie manages to keep his feet on the ground while his head is in the clouds  but in real life  Barrie's overactive imagination often gave him problems in distinguishing fantasy from reality.Though Depp is brilliant as usual  he is nearly acted off-screen by young Freddie Highmore  whose ability to convey so many powerful emotions through a single glance or sigh is simply amazing. His glowing performance makes it crystal clear why Barrie chooses Peter as the namesake of his greatest masterpiece  the boy who never grew up. Though Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman)  Barrie's grudging producer  is skeptical throughout the film that \""Peter Pan\"" will be a hit \u0096 even calling it \""my nightmare\"" on opening night \u0096 its instant success soon eclipses Barrie's recent theater flops. It would later go onto eclipse his forty other plays and dominate his life  but that's a depressing tale for another time. (In real life  Frohman was devoted to making Peter Pan a hit  and Barrie was the one full of doubt.) At a private performance of the play for the Davies family  Peter Pan turns to them and asks the famous plea to clap their hands. The four boys are all too awestruck to clap ... until their stuffy grandmother  who has spent the entire movie disapproving of Barrie and his fun with the boys  positively bangs her hands together to save Tinkerbell's life. More than anything  her actions capture the magical spell that \""Peter Pan\"" still holds over any audience. I was clapping my hands  too. The movie truly made me believe.Look closely and you will spot an actual member of the Davies family. In reality  there was a fifth Davies brother  Nicholas  called Nico  born in 1903. Nico married in 1926 and welcomed his only child  Laura  in 1928. Laura appears in \""Finding Neverland.\"" Just after the first performance of \""Peter Pan \"" she is the theater patron who says to Freddie Highmore (playing her real-life uncle)  \""This is Peter Pan! How wonderful!\"" She is credited under her married name  Laura Duguid. I would like to add that I have read several biographies of JM Barrie  beginning since long before this movie was released  and that the rumors of pedophilia are totally untrue. Barrie loved the Davies children platonically  not sexually  and both of the boys's parents considered him a friend \u0096 though they were sometimes bewildered by the author's oddities  and quite understandably so.\tI will make this short. Finding Neverland is quite likely the best dramatic movie in 2004. Johnny Depp plays a fantastic role  easily the high spot of his filmography. The movie its a brilliant journey to a man's mind. The very man who imagined the Neverland  and made us dream with a world unlike any other. Peter Pan sure is an incredible character after all. By watching the movie  my childhood memories were mixed up with some kind of an emotional spirit that drives the plot since the first minute. Finding Neverland comes out as an outstanding  spirited  heart-driven movie which may and will probably appeal to anyone. I highly recommend it.\tFinding Neverland tells the story of J.M. Barrie (Depp)  playwright who wrote Peter Pan. This film is very well directed  and although a bit slow very beautiful to the eye. Depp  Winslet and Christie are great. It was also great to see Dustin Hoffman in a supporting role. The film was interesting  beautifully done and only problem I had with it was the third act was a bit boring  especially the last 20 minutes. However it was good and scenes with Depp and Winslet were great as well as Depp and Christie tangles. I liked the way Depp portrayed the playwright  another interesting look by this actor who is getting more and more popular these. 9/10\tAs soon as I heard about this movie  I knew that it would be a movie that I would like. It just looked like that rare magical piece of cinema which one watches  and then wants to watch again and again and again. From the moment the movie started  I was transported to another world... the world of \""Finding Neverland.\"" Of course  Johnny Depp is my favorite actor of all time  but besides that  all the other actors play believable performances  as if you forget they're Johnny Depp or Kate Winslet (reminiscent of Jamie Foxx's performance as Ray Charles.) Freddie Highmore (who co-starred with Depp in \""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\"") is a promising young star who has much talent... I hope he'll go on to play more great roles. David Magee's script is beautifully crafted  and the cinematography and direction of the film under Marc Forster is beautiful and breath-taking. If you enjoyed this film  which I am sure you will not be disappointed  I recommend \""A Dog of Flanders\""  another movie about creating great works of art.\tYes  I blubbed at the end of Finding Neverland. It played the minor chords on my heartstrings effectively enough  but the film suffers from a slight lack of momentum  largely because of the performances of Johnny Depp and Dustin Hoffman.Hoffman  a dandyish figure with a mid-Atlantic accent  is a puzzling comic-relief character whose screen presence is distracting rather than engaging. I found myself thinking  whenever he appeared  \""It's Dustin Hoffman! What's he doing here? And is he supposed to be American or British?\"" To be fair to Hoffman  it is possible that his accent was a perfect rendition of what Americans sounded like in J. M. Barrie's time  but he never seems comfortable in the role.And Depp is just a bit wooden. Again  perhaps he is meant to be restrained - the film is set in Victorian Britain after all. But Depp's soft Scottish tones and phlegmatic response to any event  no matter how dramatic  makes the film a little flat. If someone had run in and shouted \""Run for your lives  the house is on fire\"" you feel that Depp would have looked pensive and cooed \""Ooh  dear. We'll have to put it out  then.\"" It doesn't help that the central drama - a main character's disease - is telegraphed so far in advance that you can't believe it is a surprise to anyone when it makes its grand entrance. Still  Kate Winslet is excellent as ever in her English rose role and the children are very good indeed.If you are fond of a weepie  Finding Neverland will not let you down. But compared to other films ranked in the Internet Movie Database's top 250 it is decidedly weak.\tA beautiful fairy tale like we no longer see on the big screen.Nice picture and good soundtrack overall with some very well performance from Johnny Depp (with a fairly good accent) And a touching Kate Winslet in her role of widow.And of course not to missed is the amazing little boy \""Peter\"" who will go far on the silver screen! Most of people will say it's a GREAT movie but I'll say it was GOOD and the reason why people liked it so much is because it allow us to dream a little bit.And who knows maybe we as well will find Neverland... I give it 8/10"""
Four Brothers (2005),"Went to see a preview of it two nights ago  and was presently surprised with it. Very good movie. Despite the fact that it's about four brothers avenging their mothers death  there is a lot of humor in it. The brothers give each other sh*t all the time  but you can tell they love each other. Mark Whalberg (sp?) did a good job  but i think my favorite character was Jackie  played by Garrett Hedlund. There was a lot of action  a lot of violence  very graphic  but it was well done and believable. Not exactly a movie for children  but it's a family movie. All in all  it's very funny and uplifting (towards the end)  but very sad.\tThis movie has some great things about it. In its story of four adopted sons of a passionate dogooder (\lost causes\"" loved by no one in the world but her; she's as true a saint as any of Rossellini's or Von Trier's) returning home for their mother's funeral after she is murdered as a witness to a petty robbery  it is nearly Shakespearian in its tragic scale. But when these brothers in everything but blood lose sight of everything their mother stood for and the movie dissolves into a macho (and egregiously sexist) revenge caper  all of that early power is sacrificed. The mother's \""ghost\"" appears to each of them in turn (more Shakespeare)  but only--get this--to warmly remind them of their table manners. Singleton abandons this audacious device when it could do the most good: where is she when her sons are ignoring everything she ever taught them  and executing in cold blood the men they believe to have killed her? This tragedy of failed character is not acknowledged by anyone  least of all the director John Singleton; instead it is celebrated. After the adrenaline ride Four Brothers took me on--the nighttime carchase/shootout in an urban blizzard is absolutely stunning--the movie ended leaving me feeling sad. Sad for the boys  and sad for the mother.The sacrifice of one of the brothers  and of any character and honor the mother's love might have helped these boys build  for a murderous campaign carried out in her name  is the true--but overlooked--tragedy of this story. It could have been a much larger movie if Singleton had continued to use the mother's \""ghost\"" as a device to show that the brothers were at least aware that what they were doing was out of anger and revenge  and would have been against her wishes. There was none of that kind of dialog. What could have been grand tragedy in the tradition of John Ford  becomes instead a hollow Charles Bronson fantasy. No; THAT'S the real tragedy.\tAlways skeptical of Mark Wahlberg's acting skills  I hesitated when offered tickets to this preview screening. I was  however  gratefully surprised that he wasn't playing his usual pretty-boy-tries-for-tough-guy role. More impressive was the fact that the plot line and dialogue were so believable. I could venture a guess that most people will not appreciate the graphic violence of this film but I can tell you that it is necessary to make the overall experience of the movie believable. There is nothing miraculous about this movie and no themes are terribly difficult to discern. If you were ever curious about the reaction children would have to the murder of a loved parent  you can pretty much see it played out in this film. Congrats to the studio  this one is a good watch!\tI was lucky enough to see an advance screening last week. My friends and I were very entertained. It was very humorous- had great one liners. Mark Wahlberg was my favorite. He was hysterical. Tyrese  Andre 3000 and Garret Hedlund did great jobs as well. It was all about the chemistry between the brothers. It had great music as well. They used a lot of old Motown songs. It was action packed and funny. The audience was really into it. They were cheering and clapping. We were pretty much sitting on the edge of our seats. I have to admit I'm not a huge John Singleton fan but he really shocked me. I think he did a wonderful job. I recommend it to everyone.\tThe movies today are so much different then the older ones. Lol its almost like video games. Everything is declining. The good ideas were takin already  so everything now is just a remake with better video. Only they still cant make it good. Well I thought this movie was pretty damn decent. Everything I expected came outta this movie. The brothers were hilarious with each other. They were great when it came to their roles in the movie. The only thing i think they lacked a little was the emotional part of their mothers death. But I don't know  I'm not in my thirties and my mom is still alive. Lol. Other than that the movie was great. More than just entertaining. Anyways  its worth a trip to the movie theaters. I might even go again with some friends tonight. Definitely gonna get the DVD. see ya.\tGreat movie! Great story line  and actors are terrific. The only thing  is why did they kill Jack?. I hope on DVD they make a Alternative Ending  where all four brothers are alive. Please  make and AU ending. OVerall it's a great movie. Storyline was good  and it's a great movie. I hope there will be an AU. I love how actors played  it's not only about revenge. It's a brotherhood  how family strong for each other. See the movie  you won't be sorry. I give it 10/10. I never cried on movies  but I did on several scenes: one when they had a dinner  and second when Jack died.And Jack  he was very good  little faerie. Jokes are priceless  and Bobi is great.\t****please note - I tried really really hard to figure out how Mr. Ejoifor spells his first name. I found both CHIWETEL and CHJWETEL all over the place  but no \""official\"" actor's web page. I've chosen to use CHJWETEL in this review... i guess because I think it's cooler. No disrespect is intended. At least  not in the spelling (or misspelling  as the case may be) of his name.*** Well... I wanted to like it more than I did. Every time I was just getting into its groove... Victor would show up. Huh? Who is this actor and why is he on my screen? Who would be afraid of this goof-ball? I can't remember the last time I felt an actor was so over his head in a role. The floor-eating scene... am I the only only one who said to myself  \""If I were in that room  I would have made him wipe up that mess he made on the floor  washed his potty-mouth with soap  then spanked his little butt for being too big for its britches and sent him to his room!\"" Victor Sweet is supposed to be this incredibly powerful Detroit underworld commander... an Overlord of Evil  even. I like the role  and I love the fact that casting selected a relatively unknown actor. I just think it was the wrong actor. He came across... immature.He fell so flat; there was no sincerity  nothing real behind it. Just some goofy guy that the baddies were following because he reminded them mildly of Laurence Fishburne.I kept picturing the filming of the his scenes going something like this: John Singleton: OK. CUT.JS runs hands thru hair and sighs: OK  CHJWETEL  THAT WAS GOOD  LET'S DO IT AGAIN. BUT THIS TIME  CAN I GET YOU TO DO A LITTLE MORE... UM... SOMETHING? CHJWETEL EJIOFOR (CONFUSED): I AM DOING SOMETHING. I'M BEING VICTOR.JS: UM  YEAH. LET'S SEE A LITTLE MORE OF THAT.CE: HUH? JS: WELL  VICTOR HAS A PERSONALITY. WHAT KIND OF PERSONALITY DO YOU THINK HE HAS? CE: HE'S ENIGMATIC. I'M BEING ENIGMATIC.JS: YES  CHJWETEL. HE IS Definitely ENIGMATIC. BUT UNDERNEATH THAT  HE'S A REALLY BAD GUY. REALLY BAD. VICIOUS. EVERYBODY IS SCARED OF HIM BECAUSE THEY NEVER KNOW WHAT HE'LL DO NEXT. HE'S BOILING OIL UNDERNEATH THAT COOL EXTERIOR.CE: HE'S ENIGMATIC.JS: YES  BUT BOILING OIL UNDERNEATH.CE: I'M BEING ENIGMATIC.(JS LOOKS AT CHJWETEL)CE  STARING BLANKLY: ENIGMATIC JS STARES CE  STILL STARING BLANKLY JS  MUTTERING AND WALKING AWAY: OH  DEAR GOD  WHAT HAVE I DONE?CE  CALLING AFTER HIM: ENIGMATIC?!?? AND... SCENE.Like I said: I liked the movie. Go see it. Just don't attach a powerful identity to Victor  because you'll be disappointed if you do. Pretend the part is being played by someone else.I actually may get it on DVD  then cut out little pictures of another actor (ANY other actor!) and edit them into all of Cjwetel's place... any suggestions?\tThis movie is so wrong on many levels. The gun violence is so over the top it boarders on stupidity. Every cop in the country should revolt against this movie  it depicts them as stupid  corrupt unprofessional and ineffective. The heros are gun wielding  drug taking  lawless  anarchists  bullies with no redeeming qualities except grief for their shotgunned down mother. The movie takes place in this make belief world  called Detroit  where all the people are huddled in their homes watching and letting these four nuts run the world. At one point in the movie the corrupt cop walks out of a bar full of people with his cop partner  shoots his partner then pretends to act like there is another person there who actually did the shooting  gets on his radio and says he needs backup and shoots his gun next to the radio for effect. All this is done without one person coming out of the bar to see what is going on or anyone coming to windows all around the shooting. This is an ugly anti social movie.\tJust a bit of forewarning  this review is going to include spoilers.After watching this movie  I found that the movie marketing industry is going downhill  as all of my predictions for the movie were right. For example  when a movie titled \""FOUR Brothers\""  and you see the names and faces of actors Mark Wahlberg  Tyrese Gibson  and Andre Benjamin  it becomes natural to assume one of two things: a.) Garret Hedlund (the fantastic actor who plays the fourth brother) dies  or b.) Someone in the whole movie making process to preview editing process can't count. The former of the two would be the accurate one. The movie also has a lot of open ends  such as what was so bad about these kids that they couldn't get a home elsewhere? The movie does a little development of character for each of the brothers  mostly on present development  giving very little to the past.The acting on the other hand was awesome. Mark Wahlberg always does good as a leading man and continues his reputation with this movie. Tyrese Gibson  who is an emerging actor from the past 9 years  plays the stereotypical role you'd expect to see someone of his stature playing  in other words  the guy who is pimping the girl and running around shooting things. Andre Benjamin plays the more successful of the brothers and did a fine job at creating the feel of someone who started out bad but then turned right  making character acknowledgements towards a rough past  but standing as a firm family oriented man. Garret Hedlund does  in my opinion  his best job yet  being a very new actor on the scene  showing through consistently noted childhood trauma through an emotional  almost terrified  face  as well as establishing a very human character who is used to getting picked on and just roles with it (as many people do).The plot is good  it makes sense  much more than most movies that are made these days. It follows the story of likely events. It does carry its brief surrealistic points used for cinematic purposes  but the majority of the events actually are a possible reality for some people to go through.Altogether  I'd say this was an Okay to Good movie  not something I would bother seeing twice  but one I might consider buying when it comes out on DVD.\tWhile giving this film a 4/10  I have to make certain qualifiers. If what you have come for is a double helping of playfully gratuitous violence with a refreshingly illiberal side of misogyny  then  odds are  'Four Brothers' is for you. Nevertheless  to enjoy this movie  means to disregard plot-holes that are too numerous to count and bland  amateur acting across the board. Then again  what can you expect from a film whose three main stars were initially famous for their music  and modeling really gay-looking underwear at Times Square? It's also worth noting that Detroit is a uniquely dilapidated  depressing place. In a better 'Four Brothers ' this circumstance would have allowed for an interesting relationship between the cinematography and the plot. In the one were we are served by the studio  it just makes everything dark  snowy and  for lack of a better word  crappy-looking.\tThis movie was a lot better then I have expected which says a lot since I've seen many  many movies. When I saw the Trailer  I was a bit skeptical about the whole thing but Marky Mark gave me a reason to see it. I've enjoyed \""Italian Job\"" and other movies he had been in so I had decided to check it out.The acting in this movie was impressive by each cast individual. The storyline was deep and expanding  branching off into different directions for each of the character.My favorite character  Jack had the most unique storyline of them all that left his past opened for pretty much any possibilities. Garrett Hedlund has a lot of potential and I hope to see him in more movies in the future.So in general  this movie had outdid itself more then I could imagine. Thougn no movie is never perfect  and this is no different  I gave it a high rating because I walked in feeling disappointed but came out satisfied instead of the other way around.\tThis movie was great. It's the first must see movie of the year since Crash. It hails back to the old westerns. The shoot out scenes are unlike any i've seen in a movie - they show violence in its purest state. It has one of the best car chases in a film that i've ever seen. It definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. The acting  writing and direction is tremendous. Low budget doesn't show - it's beautifully shot. The violence abounds - but Mark Walberg's character takes the focus of his mother's death and is unrelenting - i'm not sure how i'd feel in this situation - but Mark Walberg's character is unwavering. Fantastic film - highly recommend it.\tI'm not really sure what i think of this movie...I'm usually a fan of most of singletons movies but this one is a bit iffy.the story is basic simple bare bones vengeance at first then tries to get more complicated when maybe it should have just stayed simple.also I'm not really a fan of mark whalbergs whiney \""sensetive\""voice especially when hes supposed to be a tuff guy or a bad ass...he just sounds like a phony or even a pussy. but i gotta admit he did have most of the movies best lines.this movie was so close to being really good but something was missing...i just cant really say what.sure there were lots of dumb things just for the sake of looking cool but ya tend to forgive that sometimes in this type of movie.while whalberg seemed to over act a bit the rest of the cast seemed as if they could care less. i was a bit disappointed in andre since i actually liked him in be cool but here he just wasn't put to good use.any way this isn't horrible bad or a sucky crap movie but its not great or all that good either I'm a bit on the fence...sorry\tAll right  how many of us would actually expect a movie like this to be good or above average? I mean  many urban flicks or street revenge types are usually just average  so-so. But this  I must say  is a good one. The story was catching enough as it is. It might be typical or mindless at times  but it has its funny moments  its tense moments  and parts where you will be at the edge of your seat. There is really not much bad to say about this movie except that maybe the end could have been better and certain parts could have been delivered differently. But there are four reasons (perhaps more) why this movie is good--four main reasons at that. The first one is already mentioned--about the story being catching and so on. The second reason is because in this movie you get a feel of how close these brothers really are  regardless of their differences of race. You see them together as a family and act like everyday brothers when they're not out beating people up. And with that said  the third reason is how convincing the actors are  especially Wahlberg. I have seen him in plenty of movies  but now I think I will see him as the bad boy  hot-headed Bobby from this. He did a very well job as did the rest of the cast. The final reason why this movie is good is because it stays to what it is. It does not stray  suddenly become an intense drama or overly done comedy  etc. I think you know where I'm going here. This movie stays as what it is supposed to be--an urban revenge flick. Other movies like this take whole different route and stray from the story. I was afraid this would do the same  especially when it started explaining why everything happened. But I am happy to say that I am not disappointed. If you are into these types of movies  I'm sure you will feel the same. It was not bad at all =) 7/10 Stars\tNo matter what  I have always loved John Singleton movies  and i couldn't pass this one up. The story and plot sounds weak at first  but don't be fooled! The story becomes unpredictable! This was the first drama/action movies I have seen in theaters  and this one was great. Whats great also was the acting. You'd think Andre 3000 would suck at acting like all the singers-come-actors  but he proves you wrong. I was skeptical at first  there hasn't been a \""good\"" John Singleton movie in a while  and i thought there will never be  but again  i got proved wrong.Obviously  this movie isn't for children  there is one gory scene (but I don't want to spoil it for you) and in the end  it was totally worth watching. There are parts that are funny and there are parts that make you want to cry. It really brings up emotions nicely. If you haven't seen it yet  I HIGHLY recommend you do  because it really is great  and probably more than what you expect (it was for me).\tThis is just a bad movie plain and simple. The story is full of trite scenes and flashbacks that make you want to roll your eyes and do nothing to build any attachment to the plot or characters.There are a few scenes with some humor and a couple of action sequences are pretty good. The acting is decent  Wahlberg is a fine job and did some of the other brothers  but the pathetic story is just horribly stupid and overwhelmes any redeeming qualities this film has.The final action scene...what a revenge movie is all about...was boring it also was one of the stupidest three minutes of my life. I couldn't wait for this movie to end  and it did't end soon enough.\tThis is by far the best movie i have seen this year and i watch a lot of movies. I am a movie theater fanatic  watch at least 3 movies a month. Keeping that in mind again this movie is a must see. I liked the hardcore action and many funny moments. If u liked past movies such as big hit and Italian job then you will love this movie  guaranteed. Mark Wahlberg delivers again and there quite a few new faces that made this movie even better. John Singleton did an excellent job with this movie. The movie was so good when it ended people clapped now that says volumes to me. Andre did a decent job  so did Tyrese. Sofia vergara looked hot!!!!\tThe movie was great. I had no problems keeping up with the plot. The camera work was great. The characters(4 brothers) themselves each had complicated personalities. I liked that. The supporting cast was marvelous. From the dirty cop to victor sweet. Action galore. I felt like this movie was somewhat influenced on real street life  versus much of the hip hop garbage we see on TV. Mark whalberg did it for me in this movie. A little short brawler with a quick fuse that would not take any crap. So all in all this movie has actually set a new standard. To bad they had to kill off the youngest brother to do it. I give it 4 stars.\tOh where to begin. How about direction? But what direction? I certainly didn't see any in this movie. It amazes me how films like these even get the green light. The editing was just plain awful. There's countless scenes where I just started to laugh at how poorly written most of the dialogue was. And who the heck was the casting director. The punk rocker brother is an abysmal actor. Family connections? I don't advise this but if you ever watch this movie again just watch him. It's plain terrible. Andre 3000 did an O.K. job considering he has no formal acting background. I'd still rather see him making good music which he does very well. Marky Mark didn't shine too brightly either. I advise anyone that has good taste in movie's to just stay away. Why is this averaging more than a 3 on this website? A 7.2!! I had to bump this movie down a bit that's just waaay too high for this movie.\tyesss sooo like a lot of other people who saw this movie  i was really surprised by how good it was. it was an all around solid movie. i thought it was going to be a rather story-less action flick  so i was quite pleasantly surprised  walking out of the theatre. i'd recommend to pretty much everyone  except people who don't enjoy seeing people being shot; there is rather a lot of that :P. did anyone else find that when jack stuck his head out of the shower when they were all (except jerry) chilling in the bathroom  that he was really really hot? ahaa cause i thought he was. extremely so. anyway it's a solid movie  go see it.hope there were no major spoilers in there."""
Garden State (2004),"Apart from the cloying pretension of the entire script  the hamfisted metaphors  the often frighteningly amateurish acting  and the fact that Zach Braff apparently thinks gazing emptily into the camera communicates some soul-stirring information on the nature of the character he plays  this film is very poorly done even on the most basic levels of film-making. Witness the repeatedly blown eyelines (for example  where the hell is he looking when the cop pulls him over on the motorcycle?)  horrid and clich\u00e9 shot selection  and abysmal characterisations... Some people have been giving this film a pass  saying \not bad for a firt effort \"" or even claiming \""Braff really knows what he's doing behind the camera.\"" Well  as someone who's gone through a graduate film program  I can tell you  this IS bad for a first-time effort; Braff does not seem to know much about what he's doing behind the camera; and many of the blunders in this film would not be acceptable in a student film  much less a feature. 2 things really bugged me. One  how the hell did he get Ian Holm to show up? Does he have pictures of him naked with a sheep or something? Two  and this is them kind of precious garbage that enrages me in films like this  good thing there's a vintage WWII era motorcycle lying around in the garage  complete with sidecar  because  y'know  it looks really neato. While saying nothing at all about character or story.I don't know Mr. Braff  but he seems to havepoured rather too much of himself into this flick  and convinced himself that virtually every clich\u00e9 of 20-something ennui constitutes blinding  revelatory insight. I am at an utter loss to explain this film's 8 out of 10 IMDb rating  except to posit that those raving over how deep this film is are the same sort of self-involved  self-pitying spoiled rich white kids from Jersey  or similar environs  who seem to share Mr. Braff's conceit that their commonplace and often trivial hardships constitute the stuff of tragic melodrama. I'll see your Zach Braff and raise you half a dozen Kevin Smiths.\tI remember seeing this movie on PayPerView  and having the info say 'Andrew Largemen goes home' and I snorted and decided not to watch it despite all my friends and their pleas. It came on OnDemand on Cinemax last week  though  and I decided I wouldn't be out of any money if I did watch it or anything...didn't have anything better to do...Oh man. I was just blown away. It was such a great movie. The dialogue  the events  the characters...they were all perfect. I could not find one fault except that we never found out what Largeman's headaches were about  but in the end I didn't care. Sam and Andrew were the perfect couple- they fit perfectly  more than any onsceen couple I have seen (save Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy). Largeman was talking a lot of bull when he got on the plane and I thought he sounded like a stupid kid who has no idea what he's saying and I thought 'damn  Zach Braff  you almost had me'- but then he went back to Sam  with a perfect explanation. and I giggled and got teary eyed because I want a Largeman (no pun intended).I still can't really talk about it and not ramble. It was just so fantastic and became a definite favorite.\tI don't mean to sound clich\u00e9d (I know I will though) but this movie is definitely love it or hate it for most people.Most reviews seem to be 1/10 or 10/10 and this is for a good reason. This is one of those movies that will definitely \""speak\"" to some people and leave others cold. Yes here comes another clich\u00e9  I guess you either \""get it\"" or not.I'm 21 and this movie spoke to me more clearly than most movies i've seen recently and it definitely has been made for a certain generation and a certain way of thinking. Its hard to classify into a particular genre because it doesn't seem to fit anything well. It's a sort of comedy love story about a 20 something guy who is feeling that sense of being lost and un-attached that most people go through in their lives. The way its made though is definitely for the 20-somethings of today  through the music  the references and numerous touches.It definitely touched on the malaise i've felt as a university graduate who is currently feeling slightly lost and unsure about where to go in life.A lot of people seem to have slated this movie quite badly in their comments. All I can say is  not many movies make me cry or think as deeply as this one did. And thats recommendation enough for me. I loved it.\t\""Garden State\"" is one of those films that you see on a whim  and immediately recognize as something meant exactly for you. As a twenty-something disaffected youth  Zach Braff's bittersweet portrayal of a homecoming for a troubled character spoke to me probably more than it might someone older. I was genuinely surprised how good this movie was.But why is it a \""failure\""  you ask? It's not that the film fails to convey its message of acceptance and angst. It's just that I'm not sure the message was the right one.Andrew Largeman returns home to attend the funeral of his mother  whose paralysis he reportedly caused while still a young child. Feared as a danger by his father  he has been on various drugs since he was ten years old. Now back in town after a brief glimpse of his unsuccessful life in LA as a struggling actor  Largeman finds himself in the midst of old friends whose lives have turned out even worse  and a new one whose life connects with his own.The movie works in spite of some very \""film student\"" moments (such as the final scene between Largeman and his father  a very understated Ian Holm) because you start to care for Andrew as his fog is lifted and he finally begins a real life. The romance with Sam (Natalie Portman) is never predictable. You knew it was coming if you saw the poster for the movie  but you don't know the way in which they react to one another. A previous commentator remarked how Portman finally gets to show off the charm that she possessed in earlier roles  and I concur. You can't tell me you wouldn't fall in love with a girl like Sam if you just randomly met her.The failure is in the message of the film  which either seems to be rebelling against the funk that most of the characters find themselves in  or casually accepting it. I couldn't really tell which version Braff was trying to convey. There's a sense that he's being honest to what most twenty-somethings do when trapped in a small-town existence. I know myself people like the ones in the film  people whose lives revolve around the next party or the next opportunity to get high. In a small town  drugs are pretty much a crutch which keeps you from trying for a real life  imho. Braff manages to convey that disconnect from reality most effectively in a montage of speeded-up partying.I think most of the characters stumble around in a chemical fog much like Largeman's  a point that I missed the first time around. It doesn't hurt that he takes an interest in the very lovely Natalie Portman.Overall  the film has many faults  but it works on charm enough to make it a repeat viewing staple for disillusioned youth. I think Braff does go a little overboard in the styles he tries to incorporate  but he manages to make a good film despite it. And the soundtrack is a standalone masterpiece in and of itself. I don't know that this will attain \""The Graduate\"" status  but it certainly has a good start as a cult flick worth discussing long into the night.\tHopefully others out in the world will take the time to watch (\""live\"") this movie. I'm a twenty-something African-American male from Louisiana and I was touched and inspired by this great film. Having it touch me as it did lead me to write this and pick up my pen again. The music hit me to the core. The emotional impact of the movie is vivid yet not over-the-top. The inner actor/writer in me was slapped in the face. I mean  it was a cosmic kick in the head. The story was dead-on and crafted. Film is art and this is a masterpiece. Zach Braff  you have been praised enough to know your work is beautiful  yet I have to say you have inspired this educated world-weary slacker to try life again. Later.\tZach Braff's first feature is quite impressive  funny  original and surely directed. The film is especially impressive in the early scenes that establish Ancrew's distanced isolation from the rest of the world. The movie manages to shift from comedy to drama easily. And Portman gives one of her patented charming performances as one of those sweet  quirky but only mildly neurotic girls who are so much easier to find in movies than in real life.But while it is a very good movie  I felt it lost emotional resonance towards the end. This is most striking in the final scene between Andrew and his dad  which should feel like a summation of emotional themes in the movie but instead feels like something that just wasn't sufficiently set up. The problem may be that I liked Andrew but never felt that strongly invested in his life. I can't really point to anything specific and say  this should have been done different  I just should have felt more in the last 15 minutes of this movie than I did. Still  well worth watching.\tGarden State is excellent. It's funny in a mature kind of way. The scene with the dog in the doctor's office is classic. It's not distasteful  just very funny because it could happen to anybody. Sam lights up the screen from the very beginning with her silly giggle while the dog is trying to take care of business on Andrew's leg. Clever  for instance Sam \""swears\"" she thought Andrew was retarded... She's great! Genuinely a very well written story  script along with an excellent cast for today's likings. Kudos Zach  you have a lot of talent that I hope takes you far in the film industry. Andrew Largeman is just a normal guy but isn't too sure about himself  as he's pretty aware of his surroundings. Natalie Portman is a gem and she is as adorable as ever. Peter Sarsgaard is always calm  cool & collected. Or just always stoned? Garden State is definitely one of my favorites. I hope to see more of Zach Braff on the big screen.\tAmerican cinema is over run with stupid movies  they are everywhere  comic book movies  computer game movies  Disney ride movies and terrible teen comedies. All of these are aimed at the younger market  some of them make money and some are forgotten two weeks after opening. Then there are the cheaply made gems that no one wants to make  they some how sneak through the filter of Hollywood and make it to our screens. Last year was a golden year because there were two brilliant ones  Napoleon Dynamite and Garden state. Both of them had exceptional un-orthodox scripts  brilliant comedy and unforgettable scenes. Movies I could watch over and over again. Garden state is a movie any self respecting 20 something person should see  and for the rest of you  if you like irony and sarcasm with no comic book characters this is the place to go. It's so refreshing to see a young film maker use his own un orthodox script. This movie is not made like the average formulaic script and because of that it clearly outpoints most movies that are made.\tThis movie is a masterpiece. A dramatic journey that takes the human mind from one extreme to the other. Writer/Director/Actor Zach Braff is brilliant. Natalie Portman has never been better. Show me a better movie and I will get on my knees. This movie has \""changed my life.\"" From the beginning dive into Largeman's (Braff) mind  the audience is presented with a glimpse of the movie's unique style. There are not enough movies out there with this sort of intellectual depth. Not only is it well written  but it is also well acted  and executed. The soundtrack also mirrors the movies profound direction  and statement. The movie can simply trigger something n one's mind that is overly calming and ultimately enlightening. I have watched the film numerous times  and the subtle tragedy and humor contrast with each other. Leaving the audience with the conundrum of whether to laugh  cry  or just take it all in and come to our own conclusions. Overall this film is the best of my generations time. I'm looking forward to see what the outbreaking Zach Braff has to offer.\tHalf depressed and reluctant to face his traumatizing past for the first time in nearly 10 years  Andrew Largeman returns to the New Jersey region where he grew up  and this to be present at his mother's funeral. It's destined to be a short trip  since there's absolutely nothing there for Andrew. He's still estranged from his father  his old friends assume he has a successful acting career going on and \u0096 worst of all \u0096 the parental house reminds him of the accident that crippled his mother. But  shortly after his arrival  he meets Samantha and her spirited persona finally brings some joy and hope in Andrew's lonely existence. For the first time ever  Andrew actually has a reason to return home permanently...but then he has to find total peace with himself  first. A simple movie about simple characters with simple values in their lives...we don't get to see many of these and even when there occasionally is an enthusiast director who's attempts to make a clever little movie like this  they're straightly condemned to video-hell because nowadays movie-goers exclusively pay to see wild car chases and giant explosions. Even though Zach Braff was one of the few debuting young directors who DID receive some recognition and praising reviews for his \""Garden State\""  a large majority of film fanatics still hasn't discovered it. And they all should  since it's heart-warming and identifiable tale  written and directed by someone who clearly loves and respects real cinema. It's highly praiseworthy how Braff finds an almost perfect balance between bittersweet melodrama and gallows humor! \""Garden State\"" is a drama with a rather serious substance and yet it never becomes feeble or pitiful. On the contrary  the script's subtle sense of humor and the beautiful characterizations resuscitates hope and happiness!Yes  \""Garden State\"" is a very good film and Zach Braff surely knows which way he's going in the movie business. But still we shouldn't acclaim him as a new and long-awaited prodigy just yet! Although very admirable  his film isn't entirely flawless and definitely not groundbreaking. The story lacks some truly brilliant elements (ingenious ideas \u0096 if only just two or three \u0096 is what really makes films like this terrific) and it's a shame that too much of the characters' troubles are blamed on drugs. To focus more on the genius aspects again: the soundtrack is excellent (containing a great Coldplay-song and a downright mesmerizing track by Simon and Garfunkel) and the acting of an entirely talented cast simple couldn't be better. Nathalie Portman is particularly impressive in portraying the sweetest female character ever shot on film. Zach Braff already damn well knows how create moody atmospheres and how to write solid dialogues! If he'll now just find a truly innovating premise  his next project will be a masterpiece without peer! *Note: This user comment is dedicated to the sweetest girl in the world; Cazzie. Believe me  she's really great in convincing people to SEE THIS FILM!\tGarden State is a good example of the pseudo-intelligent scripting that's been haunting cinema more and more lately. It reminded me of 'Closer' and 'The Royal Tenenbaums\""... movies made by modern thinkers of modern thought: You don't actually need an idea to make a movie.As long as you can trick the audience in believing they're watching something deep and real  they will buy your story. If nothing happens  nothing has to make sense  so let's not take any chances. Put in some sweet pop music  then add some more and the kids will think every scene is gold. This is what I like to call nouveau-sub-pop; regular thrash with a flavor of Meaning.In Garden State  the meaning is something like: it's OK to be Different. The 14 year old kids love it. Even 40-year old kids will eat it and say thanks  forgiving it the pretentiousness  the pointless moments  the numb characters and all of that feel-good rubbish.An ice-skating alligator? Bless the rebels who made this movie!\tZach Braff is one lucky guy. At the start of 2004  he was just the lowly star of some of that rubbish that Americans put on TV; but by the end of the year  he's the director  writer and star of a successful and critically acclaimed movie! Garden State is the latest quirky little drama to be released independently. It seems like these sorts of films will get praised whether they're good or not these days  but to Braff's credit; this one actually isn't bad. While the film feels underdone in certain places  and the story could have been fleshed out better; Braff handles his themes with care and attention  and it's obvious throughout that this is a project that the young writer/director/actor really cared about; and that translates into the vibrancy and vitality of the story. The film follows themes of maturity and responsibility and it follows a troubled young man (Braff)  who returns home to his state of New Jersey after a leave of nine years. While home he reunites with his old friends and meets a new one  in the form of serial liar; Samantha (Natalie Portman).Pretty much as soon as the film starts  you can see that it's by a young  first time  director. Early in the film  Braff experiments with different shots  such as the bathroom mirror scene; which seems to be an attempt to show his character's broken state of mind. Considering he's a TV actor  Zach Braff's acting isn't at all bad; he suits the role that he's written himself like a glove  and his performance gives the whole piece an element of realism. The extraordinarily beautiful Natalie Portman stars alongside Braff as his opposite number. Portman delivers her performance with just the right amount of cuteness  while slightly hinting that her character might not quite be all smiles and sweetness. An excellent ensemble is topped off by Peter Sarsgaard and Ian Holm  who both do well with the roles Braff has given them. There isn't really anything on the technical side that makes this film stand out  but films like this are more about characters and story anyway; and this film has both of them. The film is interesting throughout  as the character are nurtured and we get to know them; and the film finally pays off when we finally get the end. All in all  I wouldn't go as far as to call this great or a masterpiece; but it's a solid movie and I'm not surprised at the positive reception it has won itself.\tThis is an excellent movie but I disagree with the other user's comment that this film \""defines the generation\"" of people born in the early-mid 80s. The characters are all 26++ in 2004 -- that would mean the youngest one was born in 1978.Slotting the movie as defining one generation or another seems irrelevant anyway  since it deals the arguably timeless issue of transitioning into the reality of adulthood and the yearning for security of some concept of a home that probably no longer exists (or perhaps never did exist).Zach Braff delivers an on-target performance and the supporting cast is phenomenal.\tMy wife thought she enjoyed the film. Then she changed her mind after talking to me. I was absolutely bored out of my mind. I haven't the faintest idea what people got out of this movie  or why it is in the top 250??? Being a huge film buff and watching everything from action and comedy  to dramatic  foreign and independent films  covering almost every decade of the last century  I feel like I have seen enough movies to know what makes a great movie: if I can watch a film over and over again and always experience the same level of enjoyment (I call it rewatchability)  superb acting  unique or solid story line  script with crisp and witty dialog  and if the film sparks any emotion inside of me at all. I feel like critics are now being bribed by Hollywood in order to help their industry  especially when rating films like this so highly. The highest bidder gets The best critic (hint:he wears glasses) or a major critic  2nd place gets a major paper  third gets a TV critic  etc. If you can pay the minimum $20 000  you can get an online magazine or radio show to give you a stellar review (watch a commercial for a film that's about to be released and see how many radio shows and online critics give these films great reviews. Sometimes they use 2-3 quotes from the same critic). Due to the gross amount of overrated films I regret wasting my time watching lately because of the rave reviews critics are giving terrible films  I'd rather take Helen Keller's opinion than modern day critics.Whatever's happening  its definitely convinced our movie going society and the Academy's voters to lower its expectations dramatically (not in most cases  but in the last few years  you have to agree that some people who took home statues have been so undeserving)  and it irritates me to no end. I can't find a single reason why I would want to watch this film again. Granted  there were some funny moments  like waking up after the party and seeing a fully dressed knight  or shooting arrows straight into the air with your rich friend who can't furnish a house to save his life. But I wasn't interested in the main story at anytime.The acting was completely lacking of passion and felt forced. I think Natalie Portman is the most overrated actress in Hollywood. A darling  beautiful  talented woman  but she hasn't made too many good movies since Leon aka the Professional. And wow! Talk about Method Man's cameo! Academy award winning stuff right there! I'm glad his TV show on Fox is doing well. And Ian Holm turns in what could be the only performance where his main motivation must have been \""act boring.\"" And the director  writer and star should stick to just acting. His \""vision\"" was clouded and it seemed to be a-typical directing  nothing out of the ordinary or exciting. I didn't feel anything for any of the characters (except for maybe the hamster or guinea pig that died). Could someone please explain to me why you thought the film was so spectacular? Or let me suggest this  try watching this film and others like it without Prozac. Sound like an idea?\tThis film was about a loser wanna-be actor  Andrew  who returns home to attend his mom's funeral. We learn he's responsible for his mom's disability and lived a screwed up life as a kid all doped up on psych meds. His dad's a psych doctor  but they can't communicate. He stays for a few days and hangs out with some old friends  one who is a pothead and the other is a millionaire from an invention. He meets a girl  Sam  and they talk and soon he is going to her house. They spend every day together. She's quirky in a good way  with her pet cemetery and habitual lying  and soft helmet.So  the ending is predictable. Andrew must choose to leave or stay with his new relationship.The acting and story were OK. I didn't think the plot was original enough to call this great.FINAL VERDICT: If you like indie films  you'll probably like this. It doesn't have any thrills but tells an every day story.\tThis movie has a lot of hype surrounding it and has fast become a favourite amongst the young adults. I can see why this is. Zach Braff has used popular music from indie bands and has written a story that is very appealing to young audiences.But when it comes to actually looking at the film in terms of directing  acting  script- writing and whatever other ingredients are needed to make a good movie- the film just manages to make it over the line.Firstly  the directing is extremely mediocre  but that is understandable considering Braff's experience and this being his first film. There are some scenes (in particular one in which Braff is sitting on a couch as the night passes by him) which seem like they are only there to make it look like he can direct  as if to say \""this is a creative way of filming a scene  look at my talent!!\"" Secondly  the acting is as great as it is made out to be. But as least Zach Braff can admit that about himself. When it comes to Natalie Portman she does not give her best performance. Her voice is whiny and she over acts a lot. Ian Holm is ordinary and his talent could be used in finer movies. Peter Sarsgaard is pretty good  bringing about a lively spirit to the film.Then comes the story and the script. The story basically follows the life of Andrew Largeman (Braff) as he goes back to his hometown for a funeral and he sees how his friends have changed and how the town has changed.. boy meets girl.. you know the rest. Personally  I didn't find the story that riveting  it was alright but the fact that I didn't really like the characters much brought down the film a lot. The script isn't all that wonderful either. Characters come into the film and you never see them again. Even though that is breaking the boundaries of usual script writing (which I like) it is annoying when you are introduced to someone and you never see them again.Overall  the movie is something that you see once and forget. It's not as brilliant as it's made out to be (and really does not deserve the 8 star rating it has on IMDb!). It's an average movie that might be worth seeing if you are a fan of indie bands  the actors involved  or just something to fill time.\tThis film is great in its scope of subjects that it touches upon. This film is very similar to Harold and Maude  Ice Storm and Six Feet Under(among others) in its treatment of so-called \""bad\"" or \""dark\"" themes like death  suicide  accidents and insanity. Its also funny which keeps it from being totally morbid. Zach Braff is a young genius in his ability to write and direct a film that assembles such a great story that has so many moments of mystery and revelation to it. The sense of place(home)  location(New Jersey) as well as the use of an awesome soundtrack. The emotions of these characters are honest and raw. It is a film for this current generation like The Big Chill  The Breakfast Club and Less Than Zero were for past generations. The cast is superb. Natalie Portman shows that she is the best actor in her age group. Peter Sargaard shows that he is perfect in roles allow him to be engaging and frightening simultaneously (see Shattered Glass). Anne Dowd is good in the supporting role of the bizarre head of a bizarre family. And Ian Holm is brilliant as usual. This film stands out in sharp contrast to any film made in the last few years. I highly recommend watching this movie  renting it and owning the DVD.\tZach Braff has come a long way... Wow... I must say this is my favorite movie right now... If you are into imagery and cinematography and non Hollywood romance... This is your movie... It is real... when i listen to the soundtrack i relive the movie within my own life... and i know that this sounds like i am a nerdy movie goer who fantasizes my own life in the movies... but if you see this movie you will understand the realistic non Hollywood bull___ and how everyone who has seen this movie can feel like the movie was written about them... I am extremely excited to see what Braff has up his sleeve in the future... Great acting writing  directing  soundtrack  and movie... A+ *Top Shelf W.B.\ti thought this film was amazing. i really liked it  i felt largemans character was one a lot of people could if not emphasize with -then at least understand. There were some really touching  moving parts to the film which were peppered with a lot of wry humour - which i loved. i think the saddest but most poignant bit in the film was when largeman is at his friends house party in the beginning and their playing spin the bottle on the floor but he's on the sofa and all this buzz and partying is happening around him but he's just sitting there with what looks like tears in his eyes - i thought that bit was just beautiful! anyway conclusively - i give top marks to this film  absolutely brill!\tIt's really a wonderful movie  first i had something like  what is this ? but then when i started watching it  i was completely into it it's a wonderful story  nice acting and the music takes you all the way  after watching it i searched for the music of the Shins and now i play the music every time i can  and on this way i always remember the movie.REALLY NICE - HAVE TO SEE -i have to place ten lines of comment but it's to much to explain this movie  i got enough with 2 actuallyto much lines i just want to place thisjust watch the movie"""
Green Street Hooligans (2005),"I went to see a preview of this film last week before its general release in the UK as Green Street next month and having seen some good reviews of it on here  I went with some quite high expectations. I can't complain about the acting  but the storyline and some slight niggles left me a bit disappointed. It was difficult to believe that Elijah 'pretty boy' Wood would ever get involved in a Fight Club-style street brawl; Charlie Hunnam  whilst a good actor  does the most unconvincing cockernee accent since Dick Van Dyke; and the dialogue and the singing at the end made me feel I was watching an Americanised version of a British story  rather than feeling involved in it. Other niggles such as 'Birmingham' actually being Gillingham  hooligan fights in Bank where in fact nothing at all happens at weekends  Bank not having an overground platform and 'Manchester' being a dead ringer for Fenchurch Street station did nothing to draw me into the film. Other comments say they find it difficult to believe how a Harvard kid can get drawn into football and its tribalness so easily  but as a British football fan it's easy to understand. What's not so easy to understand is why a group of British football fans would accept a wet-behind-the-ears American who's never been in a fight and states his major as History. Overall the film was entertaining  but for a British audience some of the dialogue is far too corny and American to be believable. The Football Factory does the same job much better  with better characters  better story and more humour. Check that out instead.\tActually  (now called) GREEN STREET HOOLIGANS has indeed won awards. It was the first film in the history of the SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST FILM FESTIVAL to win both the Grand Jury prize AND the audience award.Good film. Go see it -- ESPECIALLY on opening weekend September 9  10  and 11 in London  Los Angeles  New York  and Chicago. Hopefully  it will roll out to other cities after that.Support truly independent film companies! They don't have fifty million dollars to pay for advertising so spread the word! And the director happens to be a (hot and bad-ass) female who is apparently drawing on her own experiences being part of a violent football world such as the one depicted here...\tGritty  violent  stylish  but in no way does it glorify the lifestyle. The bad is shown to so heavily outweigh the good  and when people fight they get hurt. There's not that much good to be seen in the movie  but it is a very good movie  and I would think something which captures the feelings and beliefs of these groups of people very well.The opening fight scene is pretty harsh  and I have to say the only \enjoyable\"" fight scene of the film. Now by enjoyable  I mean in a Hollywood entertainment sense  because the violence in this movie is so real  you don't want to think that it fits the standard Hollywood template of violence and glorify it in anyway  however this scene does slightly  and perhaps to grab the audience because hereafter you'll be shocked and uneasy.The second fight scene of the movie deserves pointing out as well  because it combines some great filming effects and camera work to provide a different look to a scene shot so many times before. It's hand-held and close up  and these things are not my particular favourite in Hollywood fight scenes  because you miss so much you have to end up guessing what's happening  I wish they'd look more to Asian movie makers on how to do this right. However the style in this scene comes through with the use of a couple of effects which make the whole fight seem quite surreal  perhaps how the main character views it. It really gave some excitement and confusion to the scene  yet keeping the feeling of violence very real  and very nasty.Now  onto perhaps two of the most controversial parts of the movie  and no  I've already talked about the fighting and that's not one of them. Firstly the casting of Elijah Wood as the American who discovers this world of Football Firms. Many people are saying that he just doesn't suit the movie  that he's totally out of place  well I agree but only to a point. Yes  for most of the film he's out of place  his laughing moments seem awkward  like those moments when you tell a joke and your foreign friend doesn't catch it but laughs anyway because everyone else does. You see  I think perhaps he is supposed to be looking totally out of place and awkward here  I mean he's come from Harvard and is a Journalist  why would that make him feel easy in amongst UK organised Football Hooligans? He has redemption though  in the final act of the film he faces a tough decision  and I really do believe it's from this point on that he comes into his element and gives a very good performance. Still  there is that stigma associated with his most famous role to date  and it's very prominent here. The \""fish out of water\"" style and awkwardness is also easily taken as bad acting  that said I could be wrong and it could actually be bad acting! The second controversial part of the movie is something that perhaps only people in the UK will grab  Charlie Hunnam's accent. His cockney accent is pretty bad  there are moments when he settles into it  but there is a distinct feeling that he's over pronunciation much of what he's saying  particularly the Cockney inflections.However  putting the accent to the side his performance is really good and very convincing  when you see him give an order  take control of a situation or in the midst of a fight  you believe who he is 100%. Without a doubt he appears strong and single minded  and a very violent character.Yet for me  it's Leo Gregory that steals the screen. His performance as Bover is totally immersive and you're drawn to him on screen. If I remember Lexi Alexander  the Director and Writer  introduced him at the Q&A after the EIFF premiere as the UK's answer to Sean Penn  and you can see why. He has all those qualities that draw you to Penn. Let's hope he's recognised for it.Both Marc Warren and Claire Forlani are just as convincing and give strong performances  I've always liked Warren as an actor and Forlani is a new find for me. These two have a good chemistry  although not all that you'd expect from a married couple  Forlani gives an emotional performance.Geoff Bell as Hatcher  the leader of the Millwall Firm  is a true psycho. Totally broken and void of the understanding of morales  you can see he's consumed by complete hatred and anger. He just seemed such a real character and a truly scary man! The ideas of retribution  morales and karma are very strong throughout this movie. It's an example of how good the script is when you can understand the allure of the Firm for the character of Buckner  as well as see and understand the bonding between the members. It does a lot for the audience to help them understand the reasoning behind it all  and this is where I think the controversy for Hollywood lies. These are the parts that can be viewed as portraying a positive light on the Football Firms rather than the actual fighting  and it's not hard to see that. Yet I do think it's balanced by the retribution and karmic endings shown.Overall a strong movie  although Wood's casting is very unusual and seems quite awkward during the first two acts of the film  coupled with the poor accent of the lead Englishman and there lie the negative aspects. The story  portrayal of the Firms and the violence itself all give for a strong and hard hitting movie  although perhaps more attractive to a British audience.\tThis is an awful movie  that should never of been made. None of the character's feel real. The acting is very poor  none sound like the average West Ham fan. Why did they have a German director  This comes across as blatant racism against the English football nation. Green Street failed miserably to reflect the multicultural Society that is truly a part of the real Green Steet. This is tabloid exploitation film-making at it's worst. They should not of set this in a real football club. This Rubbish just typecast's all English football fans as hooligans. Hopefully this movie will fail at the box office  both I.D and The Football Factory were miles better than this. Which proves just how terrible this is. 1 out of 10 but only because i couldn't give it zero.\tElijah Wood plays a \""Yank\"" in London and gets sucked into a kind of friendship that you just do not walk into lightly. He plays the off centre role very well and is clearly a departure in character that begs Hollywood planning in not playing the nice guy after all that the public knows him for  namely Lord of the Rings. (Also seen in departure from this role in Sin City  where he shows his mettle). The cast is neatly assembled from well known  and not so well known  British actors and most give a five star performance despite a script that will draw a lot of criticism for being slightly right wing on the football hooliganism stakes. Yes  it does pro yob to a degree  yes there is a lot of violence  mostly out of shot and stylised into fast motion photography  but it works well in making you try to hide and  at the same time  face up to the supposed life of part of UK football society. (If you like this  try Football Factory - The \""goodfellas\"" as opposed to this film being \""Godfather\"")\tI was lucky enough to see Hooligans while in Austin  TX attending the SXSW film festival. I'm really glad I did because as far as I know it hasn't gotten wide release yet which is a shame. I'd go see it again if it gets a theatrical release.Although the story is very \""fight intense\"" the characters were rich and fully developed and made you care about whether they got hurt or won or loss. And although Elijah Wood was the lead and gave an outstanding performance  I think it was really Charlie Hunnam's performance that was the break out of the film. He WILL be a star if given the opportunity.Overall I'd have to say it was a great indie flick!\tI saw this at a mystery preview screening where I didn't know what film was going to be shown. Sometimes these previews turn out to be real turkeys but thankfully that wasn't the case this time.Without revealing too much of the story  Elijah Wood's character gets kicked out of Harvard for a drug offence he didn't commit. He flies to London to visit his sister and quickly gets caught up in a small group of West Ham United supporting hooligans called the Green Street Elite.The film does slightly glamorise the violence  but ends on a moralising note. An engaging storyline  good cinematography and decent cast performances make this a very enjoyable film.Two minor demerits: 1) Charlie Hunnam's \""cor blimey guv'nor\"" accent owes more to Dick van Dyke than London's East End.2) To establish that Wood's character has landed in London  we hear this frankly ridiculous message over the airport's PA system - \""this is a security announcement at London Heathrow airport\"". Presumably this was inserted for the hard of thinking.To all the Americans who have commented that they'd avoid British football matches as a result of this film  I point out that this film is fiction - not a documentary. Hooligans are an absolutely tiny minority of the crowd at a football match and even then they invariably only fight among themselves rather than randomly attacking innocent members of the public (something the film accurately portrayed).All in all  an excellent film  worth going to see.\tThis is a dreadful film  it really is. Where do I start? How about the fact that the 'daddy' of the firm looks about 22 and speaks with an accent that bounces from the Pennines to LA through old Oirland and back to Leyton within the space of one sentence? How about the fact that the plot is so full of holes that by the end you're not even complaining  you're just sitting there numb and waiting for the nonsensical twist in this soulless  bloody pantomime? How about the fact that it couldn't glorify football violence any more without having all the lead characters waving flags saying  \""We Love Football Violence\"" and offering \u00a310 to the first member of the audience to bottle the person in front? Without giving too much away  there is a fight scene near the end that is set to a kind of sub-Brothers in Arms folk song and portrayed in slow motion. Someone needs to have a word with the director and remind her that football violence is not some glorious war of liberation  it's empty pain orchestrated purely for the sake of itself. I assure you  dear reader  there is nothing glamorous about having bottles thrown at you.Oh God  I hated it. It's so empty. I didn't even pay to watch it and I hated it this much.\tI just saw the film and thought it was great! i had assumed that i wouldn't enjoy it much because of it being about football  but the sport actually just provides the basis for an extremely enjoyable film about a complex and interesting subject that I  even living in the UK  had no idea was so serious. Unfortunately the question and answer that followed the premiere hinted that some may find it too controversial  with questions about it \""glamorising\"" violence. I personally feel that this is a very similar situation to Trainspotting - the film makers simply provide an honest view of a way of life  portraying the characters as real people  not just criminals. Though this led to audiences identifying with characters  both films showed bad outcomes as well as why the characters chose to live these ways. The actor Charlie Hunnam answered the questions extremely well  pointing out that it was necessary for the film to show why  not just how  a minority of people take such joy in violence. I would urge people who do not particularly like football to not be put off by the fact that it features in the film  the few scenes of football matches are shot and edited in a way which makes them very interesting to watch  as were the fight scenes. See the film when it comes out on general release!\tIt's been a good long while since I saw a truly awful movie  but it turns out that I was due. There's little I can add to the (scathing) criticism of this film that's appeared elsewhere. What I would say however  is that even if you can ignore Charlie Hunnam's distractingly bad accent  and EVEN if you can accept that Frodo is really a thug underneath it all  the fundamental problem with Green Street (as it's known under its UK release) is that the script sucks. Really. Sucks very badly. I mean seriously  did the character Peter actually say 'we're gonna end it right now' at one point near the end? The film feels like every bad clich\u00e9 from every bad 'life on the streets' movie ever made has been dropped into a blender. And what was with the soundtrack to the climactic fight scene? I was expecting it to break into Brothers In Arms.People have made comparisons with both The Football Factory and Fight Club. The former is a poor comparator - Football Factory had its faults but the portrayal it gave of the motivations of the members of the Chelsea firm was far more convincing than the two-dimensional 'thug by numbers' characterization in Green Street. Ironically the comparison with Fight Club is better  if you can draw some kind of tenuous linkage between the journeys of discovery of Edward Burns' and Elijah Wood's characters. But don't expect any of the invention  wit or intelligence of Fight Club here - you'd be better off just blowing bubbles.\tGreen Street  as it was called in the UK  or Hooligans is a bad film. The story is full of fantastical ideas and premises that anyone who lives in England  has been to a football match or knows the first thing about football will spot immediately.My first main gripe with Hooligans is the poor casting of the two main characters. Don't get me wrong  I like Elijah Wood and have a great respect for his work  but despite his best efforts he struggled to pull off this role. The main motivation for his character is anger at the system and anger at betrayal  however he spends much of the film placid and cheery  only displaying his pent up aggression in one brief scene towards the end of the film. This linked with his looks and physique make him a thoroughly unconvincing addition to a gang of football hooligans. At no point during the film was I convinced that a) he could handle himself in a fight against such thugs and b) the 'firm' of thugs would accept such a person into their fold.The other main character is played by Charlie Hunnam. Charlie looks the part  and is fairly convincing as a thug. Unfortunately  being a native of Newcastle Upon Tyne in the North of England  he demonstrates the worst East London accent since Dick Van Dyke tried to go cock-en-y in Marry Poppins. Details such as this probably will not bother an American audience who will be less attuned to regional dialect in the UK  but being from the UK it was a problem I couldn't ignore and it contributed to ruining the movie for me. The supporting cast all gave convincing performances and were well cast  especially the role of Bover. The lad playing this character would have been much more suited to the main role that Charlie played. With a film like this  you have to convince the audience that your characters are plausible  unfortunately  the casting failed. Imagine if you made a film like The Godfather and had Sean Hayes (Jack) from Will and Grace playing Michael Corleone's part. You would not be convinced. The story in Hooligan is also full in implausibilities. I am no football Hooligan  but I am a fantatical football fan. I know how cliquey a group of 'regular' football supporters can be  as such it deem it impossible for a non-football fan  who is not a fan of the club in question  is not from the area in question and not even of English nationality to be embraced by a 'firm' who equate to a secret organisation in some severe cases. My final  and biggest  problem with this film  is the way it portrays football hooligans. I take objection to the film's idea that despite being very violent individuals  hooligans are excused as they live by some sort of code of ethics in their own world and should be admired for being brave and loyal to each other. This is complete rubbish. Football hooligans are complete scum. They take football  the national sport of England and use it as an excuse to terrorise  frighten and intimidate people. They only represent a tiny percentage of football fans but give the whole game and people of this country a bad reputation. They are not brave or loyal  they are cowardly and evil. If the 'GSE' in this film truly loved their club  West Ham  why would the devote their lives to being a stain on its name. Hooligans are an embarrassment to football and to English society. Football hooligans do for the reputation of football what Hitler did to the reputation of Germans. Although this film tries/intends to show the 'gritty' side of football violence. It does nothing more than promote it as some kind of excusable activity for extreme fans of the sport. It does not show the poor innocent by-standers at football matches who have their day ruined by some idiot throwing coins/lighters/glass into the crowd. It does not show the innocent home and property owners who have to put up with graffiti and broken windows. It does not show the REAL fans of football clubs who suffer indignity and embarrassment when their teams supporters are banned from travelling to away matches or abroad to European games because the thugs among them ruin it for everyone. If you want to see a good film about football violence  watch the BBC drama 'The Firm'.\tI must be the only person who knows the area intimately. Here in the UK  the movie is called 'Green Street' after the main road where West Ham United is located and looking at the other comments it would seem that Americans actually believe this drivel about London. They should try walking down Green Street. They'll be tripping up over the kebab and curry houses  and as for seeing any indigenous Londoners  forget it  they all moved out to Essex (the suburbs) years ago. The violence is over simplified and unreal and the characters are boring and one-dimensional. The ICF (Inter City Firm) was broken up years ago as was the violence and hooliganism that benighted football (soccer to you Americans). Come on  violence like this was eradicated years ago! The problem is though  for some weird reason  the American film industry has this outdated and outmoded idea that England is awash with football hooligans  druggies  single mothers and derelicts. Wrong! It was also interesting to see Frodo take on a role outside of Hobbiton and for what it's worth  he should go back to climbing Mount Doom.\tI have just been to see this film as I was intrigued by the range of opinions I have heard on this. I have to say that I fall distinctly into the camp of thinking that this was absolute rubbish.The film opens with a load of louts standing on Bank platform and shouting abuse at a load of other louts on the opposite platform. The exchanges were dreadful as they were so clearly script written and not spontaneous. The lead character first speaks in this interchange and we hear a accent that tries to be cockney  but ends up sounding like a cross between Glaswegian  Geordie and bad Yank. Very bizarre.Even more comical is the fact that one of these louts turns out to be an airline pilot. We see him attacking a group of rival supporters whilst wearing his uniform. I suppose this is to tell us that anyone can get involved in this type of violence but it is highly unbelievable. An educated man standing with a group of thugs and beating people to within an inch of their life for fun? Pull the other one! Basically  I wish I'd not bothered going. The acting was dreadful (particularly wooden Wood)  the characters were thoroughly shallow  the dialogue must have been written by a panel as there's no consistency and according to this film Bank tube station services all of London  particularly Kensington  Leadenhall Street Market and the suburbs.\tMy girlfriend and I just saw this at the Arclight in Hollywood. WE LOVED IT! It is one of the best films we have seen in a very long time. E.W. plays an awkward fish out of water slammed into a very violent  testosterone-filled brotherhood. It's NOT FIGHT CLUB! Whereas the story in that great film had people fighting in order to feel alive in a world they hated; these characters fight for the sheer joy of defending the honor of their corner of the country that they love. W/O giving anything else away I'll say it was exciting  touching and inspiring. Great performances all the way around. As for the problems with accents that we've been reading about... It didn't bother us.\tI was waiting 18 months to see this  I read reviews and then what I saw last night beggared belief.Charlie Hunnam's accent is a disgrace. Why Lexi Alexander could not have cast an actor who is from London is beyond me.As for the content  it is badly written  I don't know any \""Firms\"" who aren't \""tooled up\"" with a blade and here we have everyone using their fists  as well as a few bottles  bricks etc.The music over the climax film is a joke  do they expect it to be taken seriously??? Avoid at all costs and use the \u00a35 or \u00a36 you would have wasted on this rubbish to buy \""The Firm\"" or \""Football Factory\"".\tWhere to start? OK  don't compare this film to fight club for a start - ridiculous. If it was even a patch on fight club  the violence  blood  gore etc would be much more evident and realistic. Secondly  this film is no football factory - which is so much more real (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby look like an embarrassment). Fair enough  the storyline is quite decent and the fight scenes are well choreographed - with a decent ending i might add. But the film on the whole is poor  seriously poor. As people have been mentioning the accents should not spoil a film - i disagree - either a simple casting error  or a lack of effort in coaching the voices caused the film to be irritating all the way through - it was obvious from scene one some American/Geordie was playing the role. Don't get me wrong  good looking guy  who looks great with a skin head - but no not a football hooligan. I could go on forever about how ridiculous the football scene was - the 'fake steward' situation. Also  when the GSE are going to play United up north  they go on the train expecting only 3 of them - doesn't make any sense - this a real organisation of gangsters and thugs  which is portrayed in the film to be some mickey mouse cult of about 5 people. In terms of accuracy - did West Ham and Milwall not play for the last couple of years they have been in the Championship together? Hmm  ten years OK. And I'm sure 'Bother' would be able to just waltz into a Milwall firm pub. Basically  a very poor film which people will like if they have little knowledge of real football  and hooliganism. If you do actually love football and are intrigued by the underworld of hooliganism   you will simply feel as though this film has insulted your intelligence. Ross George\tThe film was OK  but some of the violence was over the top  and Charlie Hunnam's Cockernee accent was atrocious! Did they not have the cash to employ a voice coach  or an actual Londoner to play the role? Elijah Wood is good though  using his wide eyed naivety as the Yank new to football  or 'soccer ' as he calls it. The film shows how pointless the cycle of violence is  how it goes on and on without an end as each firm gets their own back for violence or perceived offences by another team's firm  then the opposition wants payback for that  etc etc. It shows how violence just ends in sadness and pain and nothing is really achieved  and also shows the humanity behind those who could be seen as mere thugs. Many of the characters get embroiled accidentally with terrible consequences.\tFirstly  I have just found out that Charlie Hunnam is not an American attempting an East London accent  but a Geordie. Why a Londoner was not cast I will never know  but I do know that with him as the main character the whole film is let down. Don't get me wrong  he is a good actor. But there is no conviction behind the acting when he doesn't know how to \""speak proper\"" and says \""mate\"" way too much for a real Londoner. Not once does he say \""guv\""  \""bruv\""  \""ya know wot I mean\"" or any other slang common to any East London lad. And frankly it feels like the film is trying to fool the audience. Give us some credit please.Just easy things like make up are awful. On 3 occasions at least Elijah Wood has a harsh vertical cut dissected by 2 horizontal cuts down his face from merely being punched once by an opposing fan. Now I'm no Firm member but I've been in fights and I know that the morning after you will get bruises like you wouldn't believe after some of the things the characters go through.Little points like the amount that they drink in the pub before the match are inaccurate. Proper geezers/nutters would have 3 pints at most: any more hinders their \""performance\"". I have this on great authority having drunk with members of the Tottenham Hotspur firm...The Yid Army.However the most incorrect part of this film is the fact that a lad turned just turned 20 could run a Firm. In football Firms you only get to the top through years of fighting next to your fellow lads. Even the \""Major\"" is mid 30's at most  and neither are anywhere near as intimidating as the real thing.I went into this film with probably too high expectations  having seen the beautiful \""Football Factory\"" a year back. However it let me down through it's numerous inaccuracies and things which simply didn't make sense: A Head of a West Ham Firm would no sooner stab a Yank than look at him  let alone take him under his wing.The only saving grace I can see from this film is the fantastic performance of Leo Gregory playing Bovver. He was the only intimidating member of the Firm and then acted superbly when drinking Vodka down by the Thames having nearly killed his old Boss.Put simply: \""Green Street/Hooligans\"" is let down by sloppy dialogue  inaccuracies due to lack of research  bad casting and  although it has great potential  is let down by trying to be 2 films at once: A moral film and a violent film at the same time.At least Football Factory knew what it was  and didn't pander to the American audience. Americans trying to make a British film.\tI was quite looking forward to this film but frankly it all came crashing down the moment the 'GSE Top Boy' opened his boat to provide simply the worst Cockney accent impersonation I have ever heard. Dick van Dyke  you are forgiven.Laughable 'inconsistencies throughout the film were many  including The 'United' Firm standing outside a station (which looked naff all like Piccadilly) cheering the name of their team while they waited for the other firm to arrive from London. As bloody if ... and  '10 Years ago' The 'Major' and his firm were having a row with Millwall. Was it ever the fashion to wear ridiculous Bon Jovi wigs in the process? because perhaps the writers meant 30 YEARS!!! ...The Football Factory KIND of got it right  this one is just a parody of the subject matter  and is frankly awful  primarily spoiled by idiot casting of a Geordie actor who really should not have got past the first audition.PS Did anyone see the (extremely brief) cameo by Cass Pennant?\tBeing a football fan myself  I was naturally drawn to this story of hooliganism and its effects... I expected it to be no more than mediocre. Quite frankly  however  it's one of the top 10 best films I have ever seen. There are some amazing performances  particularly from Charlie Hunnam  and even Elijah Wood proves to the world that he's more than just  \""Mr Frodo.\"" Some graphic scenes and an emotional script  mixed in with a kind of gritty realism in every scene throughout the film makes it both highly involving and thought provoking. When I saw football factory  I thought it was a highly impressive film - in my opinion  this whoops the shite out of it. Impressive in both its genre and a wider field  Green Street is a must see."""
Grizzly Man (2005),"Too bad that such an extraordinary director didn't want to spend more time researching such an extraordinary story. The complex  tragic  pathetic  infantile  almost \Michael Jackson-esquire\"" life of Timothy Treadwell (the \""Grizzly Man\"") deserved much more commitment. Herzog himself admitted in a recent post-screening discussion that  in order to show it at Sundance  he made the documentary in very few days without even having the time to watch all the 100+ hours of Treadwell's original footage. Herzog doesn't even bother to contextualize Treadwell's bear obsession. He doesn't interview any prominent scientist and therefore we have no idea how valuable or damaging his expeditions in bear country really were. Poor execution also on the personal front of the story: Amie Huguenard  his girlfriend  who was afraid of bears and never the less followed him to his deadly Neverland and died with him  gets less exposure than his pet foxes. Then there are the debatable questions of Herzog wearing headphones and listening in camera to the audiotape of the last horrific moments of Treadwell and Huguenard's lives and the uneven choices of lenses for the interviews. Even with all these shortcomings  the documentary deserves to be seen because of Treadwell's absolutely fascinating candid footage. The pervasive feeling of impending doom a la \""Blair Witch Project\"" also helps to make this documentary watchable. Just wait for the TV release on Discovery.\tTimothy Treadwell was not a well man when he spent 13 years among the brown Grizzlies in Alaska until his time ran out one day as dinner for one of them. For me \""not well\"" means he didn't quite understand that no matter how much he \""loved\"" the bears  they couldn't always return the favor.For director Werner Herzog  of Aguirre: The Wrath of God and Fitzcarraldo fame  most of his work is devoted to eccentric and often crazed but charismatic leading men. He captures in his voice-over the essential madness of Treadwell in his new film  Grizzly Man. Using over 100 hours of the young man's footage and narration  Herzog fashions an objective documentary of Treadwell's rise and fall. At one point Herzog explains over a close up shot of a grizzly's eyes that he sees nothing but \""the overwhelming indifference of nature.\"" The emptiness of Treadwell's assertion that he knows the bears is only too evident when we listen to the animated report of the coroner as he reconstructs the mauling of Treadwell and his girlfriend. Treadwell did  however  predict he would \""live and die\"" with his friends.Thus  Herzog has another complex protagonist with hubris and innocence enough to guarantee early passage from life. This documentary does well showing Treadwell's love of drama  his alienation from society  and his superior naivet\u00e9 when it comes to formidable animals such as the grizzly. Herzog also offers memorable photography of Alaska and Treadwell's own footage  which shows him often too close to the bears. However  Timothy did last for 13 years among them; he just seemed to forget that he could not win that game.Treadwell says of the grizzlies  \""Everything about them is perfect.\"" Everything about Timothy is not. Grizzly Man is a cautionary tale about crossing the invisible line between man and beast  the cost of ignorance  and the allure of a personal vision  in this case that of a lost soul who discovers his calling but goes beyond what is allowed to mortals. Grizzly Man will help you overcome romantic notions about wild beasts (and pesky Alaskan black flies).\tFirst of all  I have not seen this movie and do not intend to. I was a Alaska State Trooper for some years and I am an Alaskan resident. This guy was well known up here as a nut case and a danger to the bears he thought he was protecting. He lied about his actions to his family  saying he was fighting off people trying to harm and hunt the bears. I have seen previews of the movie and from the actions the bears around him were taking they were very stressed and it's a wonder he wasn't attacked long before he was. This guy got what was coming to him  it's just a shame he had his girlfriend with him. If you do see this movie just remember  Treadwell was more of a threat to these bears than you can possibly imagine. By being around them the way he was  the bears become accustomed to being around people. When bears and people are in close proximity someone usually winds up being killed  and it's usually the bear for safety reasons.\tThe picture that Herzog painted of Treadwell was more a caricature than a character study. Knowing very little about Treadwell before seeing the movie  I can't say if the depiction was accurate or not. Treadwell was represented as a lost soul and an addictive personality  searching for salvation and finding it in his passion for grizzly bears. However  according to the film  passion quickly turned to obsession and Treadwell went beyond conservation to putting his own life  the life of his girlfriend and the well being of the bears he claimed to love so much in grave danger. He was accused of anthropomorphizing the wildlife to such an extent that he lost touch with reality Out of the 100 hours of footage to which Herzog had access  he chose to use film that depicted Treadwell as a kook at best and at worst someone who was narcissistic  egocentric  paranoid and deranged  bent on his own destruction. Is this the best Herzog could do? The film seemed very contrived and exploitative of Treadwell  his story and Grizzly People  the foundation for conservation that he left behind. The interviews seemed scripted and staged. The cinematography was spectacularly poor. Herzog was in what is probably one of the most wildly  naturally beautiful areas of North America and he did nothing to showcase it. The narrative was flat  in my opinion as well.\tAnyone who has followed the trajectory of Werner Herzog from the time of \""Even Dwarfs Started Small\"" will understand the immediate appeal that the Treadwell story must have had for this intensely brilliant German director. Treadwell must have seemed to Herzog like a Laguna Beach version of his Fitzcarraldo and his Aguirre and even of Herzog himself in his more unhinged moments. This film appears at first to be a fair minded documentary about Tim Treadwell  the 'protector' of all things natural and wild in the remote regions of Alaska. What Herzog shows us  however  is that what Treadwell really needed protection from was reality itself and that his escape into the wilds was just a deadly game of denial. The film is also a meditation on the brute force of nature  on art and on human hubris. My wife found the 'character' of Tim Treadwell so ludicrous and offensive that she had to leave the theater. For my part  I was in awe of both Treadwell's incredible physical courage coupled with his absolute lack of judgment and his insane narcissism. He struck me as a cross between Pee-Wee Herman and Marlon Perkins  the guy who narrated the Mutual of Omaha nature documentaries that showed up on Sunday afternoons in the 60's and 70's.The word is that Hollywood  in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio  was a financial supporter of Treadwell's 'mission'in Alaska and that a Hollywood version of the story is due out sometime soon with Di Caprio playing the lead. I know I won't be going to see that version because it will just continue the lie and the myth that Treadwell tried so hard to create and sustain. Even at his most intense moments of profoundity Treadwell had nothing to 'say' to anyone about either bears or himself. It was all self-serving and self-congratulatory and it is only in his grotesque death at the hands of a rogue grizzly that any meaningful message finally comes across. (Herzog thankfully spares us from the actual experience which was caught on audio but not on video because the lens cap had been left on.)Its hard not to feel sorry for Tim Treadwell and the young woman who died with him  but the 'native' scientist in the film put it quite nicely \""My people have been living nicely with bears for thousands of years and we know enough to stay out of each other's way.\""Tim Treadwell wanted desperately to cross the boundary into the 'way' of the bear because the 'way of the human' was too much for him. Despite his goofy  childish demeanor he revealed himself to be a man of deep anger and resentment. However  if the bears had let him live he would probably be considered something of a folk-hero in 'reality' obsessed America.Herzog shows us that there was nothing real about Treadwell at all and that the bears knew a lot more about him than he ever would of them.\tI really enjoyed the courage Tim had to go into the wilderness and live there with the grizzly bears. Most of all we would not ever have seen the unique footage of bears in the wild if not for him. He did make a tragic mistake going back and staying longer in bear country near hibernation and I wish there would have been someone to talk him out of that one! This is a wonderful DOC on adventure  passion and for what Tim thought was a great cause. He just wanted to be someone  excepted and LOVED. He did some very scary stuff in the DOC that keep me at the edge of my seat and he made me laugh too. Timothy Treadwell walked to the beat of his own drum. As he said he would die for the bears. He died doing what he Loved. How many of us get to die doing what we love? Take this film and enjoy it! Bears are indeed the TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN.\tThis documentary  written  directed  and narrated by German madman maestro Werner Herzog  has very little in it that isn't worth seeing  and at its best brings some of the most captivating  candid  and entertaining documentary footage of the year. The subject matter is an environmentalist/bear nut named Timothy Treadwell  a nobody who became a kind of weird celebrity for living each summer on an Alaskan wildlife preservation with Grizzly bears. He also documented a lot of his time on the island  which Herzog chooses wisely for his film on him. Treadwell may or may not have totally believed a fate like death among his co-habitants would come (there is one scene where he says he'd die for them  another when he says he's safe). But his fate did come  along with his girlfriends  rather grisly as we hear from the details (which  wisely  we never see).One is tempted to comment on Treadwell  as he is (much as with Herzog's protagonists in his fiction films) possessive  ambitious  naive  dazed  emotional  but somehow in tune with his own sense of nature and the ways of the world. Herzog himself comments a good deal on Treadwell  when he agrees with him  when he doesn't (Herzog  as Roger Ebert pointed out  does have a bleak world-view as opposed to Treadwell's overly optimistic one). What one can comment on is the execution of the material. We get interviews with Treadwell's close friends (one platonic  one not)  the people who found his and his girlfriend's bodies in the forest  and a couple of nearby experts (one Native American comments on how Treadwell did what they had never done in 7 000 years  to cross a boundary that was respected). Herzog also gives us majestic  spacious images of Alaskan wilderness  and gives some ample time for footage of the bears and foxes.If not for Treadwell's rather high & low nature (as a friend comments)  this might be a very standard documentary on a bear expert. But because of the documentary- or near television hosting footage (I sometimes felt like I was seeing a nicer  if stranger version  of the Croc Hunter)- of Treadwell on camera by himself  the film gets another dimension. It's also a help that in combating the grim reality of what became of him (Herzog's narration is this rather sad  if praising side)  it's rather funny to see Treadwell in his behavior on screen. In some subtle ways he's in a more 'normal' state of mind than the rest of us- he loves his bears (whom  by the way  he gave names to; he stands his ground against the occasional poachers); he has that mix of sentimentality and rawness that is needed to live for so long in the wilderness. The absurdity of it usually brings the laughs  but even behind them there is always a constant curiosity about him. We learn that he wanted to be an actor  which lead to a bad  near fatal spell before his 'bear' retreat  acting as more of a spiritual catalyst more than anything else. Even if some of this footage is a little zany  over-the-top  or may go far on his name  it is honest to a kind of schizo degree. We almost wouldn't want Treadwell to be normal  and go figure- Herzog would have no interest in him. In the end  despite Herzog's comments (which aren't the best parts of the film to me)  his film tries not to pass judgment on Treadwell  letting his actions and other testimonies speak for themselves. And  if nothing else  it's compulsively (for a certain movie-viewer) watchable.\tDependency and identity issues  depression and drug addiction and a foul mouth are the defining characteristics of \""Grizzly Man\"". The unfortunate Bears and Fox that put up with him for 13 years  I believe  finally had enough!Timothy Treadwell repeatedly stated \""he'd die for the Bears\""  whether it was a wish or desire  it came true! Treadwell  with his insane rants  and careless disregard of rules intended to protect him and his girlfriend  showed that man and nature are still in fact two separate worlds. This movie in my opinion offers some rather stunning wildlife footage. However  the \""value\"" of Mr. Treadwell and his \""work\"" remains dubious. As most of the people in this advanced screening seemed to feel  \""a whole lot of tape was wasted on Mr. Treadwell and not enough spent on the Bears\"". This was not a film documentary  but a home movie of a mans' search for himself. A search that eventually took him completely out of the world of reality and into a world comprised of only him against all other entities. One thing I found interesting about the audience reaction was the almost complete lack of sadness or sorrow over Mr. Treadwells death. Unlike the tragedy of Open Water or Touching the Void which elicited feelings of remorse and regret  no such feelings seemed to be generated by Mr. Treadwells eventual demise.\tFrom 1990-2003  Timothy Treadwell spent his life with grizzly bears  both physically and spiritually. As an activist  Treadwell founded Grizzly People  an organization concerning itself with the welfare of the brooding animals. Following the bears through the Canadian outback each summer  Treadwell believed that he had learned to think like a bear  to communicate like a bear  and truly wished to become a bear. In the last five of years of his life  Werner Herzog gifted him a video camera  so that he could properly document his findings. After Treadwell's death in 2003  Herzog reconstructed the tapes of those summers  crafting a wonderful character study of the troubled man. Treadwell had hoped that the footage would be used to show the problems that grizzly bears face--namely human encroachment  starvation  and poaching. Instead  Herzog shows us the inner workings of a conflicted man sitting outside the circle of human civilization.The self-destruction and anger that accompanies tortured souls has been caricatured countless times in literature and film. To see it in documentary form--as it is presented in Grizzly Man--gives one the most powerful and accurate representation of the life and mind of a true eccentric. Treadwell is that representation  from the first frame to last. Through his commentary on the bears and his constant mugging for the camera  Timothy fancies himself the savior of the grizzlies  speaking often of his 'love' for them. But Herzog forces the audience to question if Treadwell's motives are truly altruistic. As the protagonist rants soliloquies to the camera about the \""f----ing f---s who f---ing f--- the f---ing people who try to save these f---s\"" (paraphrasing)  we begin to see more clearly the mental state of our unbalanced friend.Treadwell's strange life and even stranger personality is certainly worthy of the 100 minutes of film devoted to him. Together  the montage of gorgeous Alaska scenery and cinema bearit\u00e9 makes for an easy sit  as far as documentaries are concerned. And though Herzog interjects an opinion or two about nature's cruelty  he functions well in his role as story teller. Unlike Michael Moore  who guides the moral approach to the film from his own perspective  Herzog allows the audience to decide for itself if Timothy's work is indeed good or bad. Herzog seems to weigh in by letting Timothy's on-screen insanity shine for itself. As is true with grizzlies  though  what you think will not influence the outcome of Treadwell's decision. Like a bear locked in the heat of battle  Timothy Treadwell lived and died a Grizzly Man.*********Henceforth begin the spoilers (only read if you have seen the movie or don't mind spoiling it for yourself).********************* In all of his attempts to help the grizzlies  Treadwell shows us one form of activism that has become all too prevalent in recent years: egoism. Rather than focusing his efforts on actually helping the animals (by perhaps raising funds to support better surveillance of the bears)  he seems more at home standing next to them with a camera. And when  in one incident  the bears are agitated by private tour-guides  Timothy finds his rightful place hiding in the bushes and videotaping the event.After several takes in the wild thickets of Alaska wherein Timothy repeats that he is indeed alone among the bears  Herzog shares with us the truth of Timothy Treadwell. He has been living together with his girlfriend Aime. Additionally  he receives help from his friends in the form of rations. And then there is the case of his multiple takes. Treadwell seems compelled to repeat his message  over and over  until he gets it perfect. After his death  Herzog must have had countless hours of irritation with Tim's self-congratulating speeches. But  then  Herzog also had the power to stop Treadwell from being martyred by a ridiculous bear-activism group.And it is Herzog who takes the limelight away  using his power as filmmaker to keep buried the sounds of Timothy's death. On location  with camera in tow  Timothy and Amie were savagely killed and eaten by a large animal (I won't say what kind of animal  but careful readers should be able to deduce from the clues given above). It is Herzog's choice not to let us hear the grizzly (hah!) incident. Instead  we must assume from the reactions of a coroner  as well as Herzog himself  that what occurred was truly horrific.On IMDb message boards  there has been discussion regarding hearing the tapes. The general consensus is that hearing the tapes would show how truly stupid Treadwell's actions were. I do not agree that we need to hear the screams of two people being eaten to come to the conclusion that what they were doing was dumb.One only needs to hear the comments of the Aleut at the Grizzly Bear Museum on Kodiak Island. Having lived side-by-side with the bears for centuries  the Aleuts have a very sensible philosophy towards the furry ones. Stay away from them  and keep them away from you. Because Timothy did not follow this simple rule  the Aleuts consider his actions to be disrespectful. While it might be difficult to interpret what the bears think of his time among them  it is certain that he was acting without proper skills or training.And then he died  not surprisingly  at the hands of a bear.\tTimothy Treadwell moved to LA transfixed on the hope of becoming a star  but got \""eaten alive\"" by the decision makers in the entertainment industry. He then went to Alaska to make what happened to him figuratively in LA a horrible reality by taunting grizzlies until one finally took his bait and killed him. The only surprises were that it took 3 years to accomplish his dance  and that he tragically took someone (an innocent woman) with him. Ironically  in his death  director Herzog came along and made him a posthumous star in what is a most compelling movie about man's relationship to nature.Treadwell emerges not as a sympathetic environmentalist  but as a narcissistic  compulsive  and mentally imbalanced wacko hell-bent on self-destruction. Not that he isn't sympathetic; he is. But he is so obviously wrong that one cannot leave the theater thinking he got what he deserved.Imagine a common housefly with a microscopic video camera flying around someone's house  pretending to be at one with the humans  filming its exploits for the other flies. The fly buzzes all around the humans  showing how the humans won't hurt it so long as it doesn't give its ground. When one of the humans tries to shoo the fly away  it tells the human it loves it. Sooner or later the hairy little pest is going to get swatted  and rightly so. Well  If I were a grizzly bear I'd feel about as sorry for Treadwell as a human would about that fly. Treadwell had to know this  and yet he deludes himself into thinking that he was somehow immune to the irrefutable laws of nature in which there are predators and prey and never the twain shall meet.In the end  the bears probably hurt him less than the Hollywood producers who years earlier led him on with false hopes; the producers being far more dangerous than grizzlies  especially in their native habitat.\tThis is the first Werner Herzog movie I've seen. I don't really know how to review a movie like that  since I feel I can't judge it by the usual standards. Some parts of it were really sad and moving. Others sent chills up my spine. One scene specifically (about Timothy's watch) was really contrived. But my favorite thing about the movie I think was how Herzog usually left the camera rolling for a few seconds after the interviewees finished what they had to say  just to capture those moments of silence and (sometimes) awkwardness  which felt really authentic. I think Herzog saw a lot of himself in Timothy's tortured soul. Also  one of the most breathtaking scenes in the movie is where Timothy captures an intense fight between two bears.\tGreat movie if you have been to Alaska or are thinking about going. Footage is really from the Alaska bush where Tim did his \""studies\"". Having been to Katami myself  I truly do not understand how he actually survived for 13 summers around these huge carnivores. The films he has of the bears in their natural environment is just fabulous. The bears and the scenery is beautiful  and a real treat if you have never had the chance to visit such a wonderful place. I thought the documentary style of the movie would be boring  but actually made it very interesting  always making you wonder what else Tim was going to do. Tim pushed the limit  and eventually went over it. I wonder if he actually harmed the bears  and other wildlife more by his \""saving\"" of them? The Grizzlies should be left wild  and never-ever feel relaxed around humans  for their sake and ours. Definitely a great movie to see  but some part of me wishes that we could have heard just a little bit of his last encounter with his beloved bears.\tVery good. I think director was compassionate and tasteful in leaving out the grisly parts. Some may find themselves looking forward to in a macabre way  but director forces you to listen to the sad plight of this individual who sought refuge in nature  but only brought along his own demons of suffering from rejection and the bitterness towards all people because of it. It is obvious that in his bitterness and loneliness  he chose to latch on to bears and nature  but when we find 'salvation\"" in just a part of God's creation (instead of in God) we easily pass over into obsession  and this has it's built in curse. He chooses salvation in something that doesn't save  so it kills him. He tells how he is special and can circumvent all the usual safety precautions normal in being around wild animals  and shortly thereafter  his presumptuous attitude brings him instant karma!!But he is tragic  and breaks my heart for the lost and lonely. On a lighter note - i wish he could gotten a clue and just gotten a dog or cat that he was obsessed over like the rest of us.\tGrizzly Man works on a lot of different levels. However  as a recovering addict and alcoholic  what I found most interesting about the film was how it exposed Timothy Treadwell as an addict (alcoholic) who may have swapped his substance addiction (drugs and alcohol) for a process addiction (gambling  sex  danger) with the bears. Like all addicts in their disease(and not in recovery)  he basically needed more and more bear to get the same fix (high) he experienced during his initial contact with them.With all addictions  there is a progressive movement away from truth. As Timothy's bear addiction moved him away from reality and toward a state of \""insanity.\"" His distorted thinking becomes apparent in the footage he shot of himself (that was never aired on his TV Special  The Grizzly Diaries). \""Addictions (without recovery) are almost always progressive and fatal.\"" -- Anne Wilson SchaefEverything about Timothy's behavior  from the misplaced anger at the Forest Service and exaggerated paranoia about poachers  to his delusional thinking about actually being a bear  showed a person trapped in their disease and moving further away from reality. Add to the fact  that his impaired thinking process was based upon faulty beliefs. And this is where his lack of formal training or education in zoology  or any of the natural sciences  really came back to bite him. (No pun intended). A \""non-addict\"" thinking person would have understood that if a male bear will kill cubs to stop a female bear from lactating so that she'll want to mate again  and that hungry bears do eat other bears to survive  that maybe they could eat me too!Like all addicts  Timothy became progressively self-centered  isolated  paranoid  confused  controlling  perfectionist  blinded to his disease (denial)  insane  blaming (projection)  and dysfunctional. In short  his life had become unmanageable. And ultimately it put him  his girlfriend and at least two bears to death. Herzog's film works as a tragedy. But also serves as a cautionary tale for all addicts  that can be summed-up by a lyric from Neil Young: \""The very thing that makes you live  can kill you in the end.\"" -- Neil Young\tI like it when I do know know how to feel! Herzog seems to start out by portraying a man  Timothy Treadwell  as a crazy  self-obsessed (NOT Grizzly-obsessed) individual who gets himself and his girlfriend killed for no purpose  in the Alaskan wilderness. Initially I thought that the story was a cross between 'Jackass' and the Discovery Channel - you have a dopey  though he only sounds like it  blonde surfer type who likes to approach (awfully close) and make sweet-talk with 10-foot bears. Viewers might see Timothy as a reckless  selfish misfit  but as the film continues  your appreciation for his cause deepens - but what is his cause? Is it to work out personal demons? Absolutely. Treadwell clearly has mental/emotional problems  just listen to how many times he tells the wild animals \""I love you!\"" or when he talks about his lack of success with \""human women.\"" But his passion for the grizzlies and their wilderness is real. Herzog particularly commends him as a filmmaker  seizing unique opportunities and rendering priceless footage. Do not forget that TT lived close to the bears for 13 years (including the year he was killed) without harm; and that his success  his careful  intuitive  loving behavior was only partly self-aggrandizing.\tFor thirteen years \""grizzly man\"" Timothy Treadwell went to an Alaskan wildlife refuge on Kodiak Island and pitched his tent alone -- and the last couple of times with a girlfriend (Amy Huguenard) -- spending the summers among huge grizzly bears. The rest of the year he went to schools and \""free of charge\"" showed his films of the bears and his exploits. When the last of his summers drew to a close he and his girlfriend died among the grizzlies as he'd always known -- and even David Letterman had pointed out -- that he might. Filmmaker Werner Herzog  longtime student of crazy eccentric loners on heroic doomed quests  has taken on Treadwell's life and personality as the subject of a rare and powerful documentary. At the heart of \""Grizzly Man\"" are Herzog's selective cullings from film Treadwell left behind chronicling both the bears and his own demons. Herzog has added interviews with women in Treadwell's life  with his parents  with the pilot who took him to and from his campgrounds and later found his and his girlfriend's remains  and with Franc Fallico  the unusually sympathetic and sensitive -- and perhaps a bit looney -- coroner who examined these. The director has bound it all together with his own frank and idiosyncratic narration. The result is a rare sober look at the more delusional aspects of man's relations to wild animals. At times Herzog by implication sympathetically links Treadwell with his former principle star and sparring partner  the late mad eccentric actor Klaus Kinski. Like Kinski Treadwell had tantrums on a film set. But his set was the outdoors and there was no director to spar with; his sparring partners were nature and his own troubled psyche. Nature contained  of course  living witnesses  chief among them the grizzly bears he knows can kill him. He repeatedly tells the camera how much he loves them. He loves the gentler  smaller foxes near whose dens he pitches his tents during the second halves of his summer sojourns. He tells the camera you must be firm with the bears  and he says he knows how to handle them  even though he also repeatedly says he knows he may die there. He is a gambler. Is he a complex man  or merely a confused one? Is he brave  or just foolhardy? What is his purpose in spending all this time among the grizzlies? Is he gathering information  or taking refuge among creatures he need not please  only keep a safe distance from (though he continually comes closer to bears than the park rules and good sense require)? He has a soft sissified manner and voice and even says he wishes he were gay. But he also rants and rages embarrassingly and tiresomely against unseen enemies  poachers  sightseers  rangers  hunters  park officials  the whole urban settled world he runs from to this world he idealizes and blindly sees as perfect. As Herzog notes  Treadwell sought to disregard nature's cruelty  and any time it was in his face -- as when the bears were starving in a dry spell and began eating their own young -- he sought to manipulate nature to eliminate the ugliness. He faults not the bears but the rain gods. Young Timothy according to his parents was an ordinary boy who loved animals from childhood and got a diving scholarship to college. But he in"
Guess Who (2005),"As I watched this movie I felt like I was watching a dozen similar films which were haphazardly put together for the sake of a few bucks. The film was not only a sorry remake of the classic film Guess Who's Coming to Dinner  but was entirely too similar to other films including Meet the Parents and dozens of other pop movies which cheaply recycle the old and tired formulas and plots featuring the introduction of a significant other to uneasy parents by an all too eager boy/girlfriend or fianc\u00e9. Guess Who was a sorry attempt by some Hollywood exec to fill seats in theaters and to sell copies of DVDs. Nothing more. I am tired of movie producers putting out the same tired and unoriginal films such as Guess Who. Where is the creativity and originality?\t... i was crying because of incredibly idiotic movie with nothing new  funny  interesting in it.There's white boy and black girl. He wants to impress her dad. You will never expected this  but he will screw it and daddy wouldn't like him. I hoped at start that this movie is something like most of comedy/romance movies  in which are interesting and funny at most first 20 minutes  the rest of it is total crap. This one wasn't one of them(i didn't liked first 20mins). So i started to hope that this movie is one of crap... crap... crap... and suddenly THE JOKE will come (something like an reward for keeping watching it). But movie was coming to its end and nothing like it happened. The end was just a typical romantic crap. She will leave him because HE LIED (oh my god  how pathetic) and he is heading for train home. Here comes the tricky part> its not her who will go find him  its her dad (even more pathetic). And to make this movie even more crap  it represented thoughts that i hate  like feminism (\remember my son  woman is always right\"")  wannabe not-a-racist (this theme is past a long while)  idiotic jokes for people with intelligence below forest gump.This one is definitely masterpiece. Master's piece of .... This is criminal act to let people to pay for watching it. It has to be reversed and reward for watching it has to be really big.\tThe answer to that question would be Ashton Kutcher  or basically anyone having to do with this movie. It has a couple of funny lines  but overall it's very  very generic. Even Bernie Mac wasn't funny in this movie  which I didn't think was even possible. It's pretty much like this - you know how on his show he's basically doing a watered down version of what he he does in his standup? Well  this was like the third filtration from the standup and basically a watered down version of what he does on the show. I don't even know why this movie was PG-13. It was a solid PG as far as I could tell. You could edit out the word \""sh*t\"" maybe a couple of times and show it uncut on network television.I hate it when comedies forget to be funny. Another lame  unimaginative  completely generic and formulaic \""comedy\"" from Hollywood. Skip this one and find a good comedy to watch.\t' -- |> I saw this movie on a Friday night with a few of my friends. We weren't sure if we wanted to see it at first but we didn't really care what we saw we just wanted to see a movie. As soon as the movie started we were all laughing. And we didn't stop laughing 'till it ended. I know most people didn't like it because it wasn't as good as 'Guess Who's Coming To Dinner'. Well I was FORCED to watch that stupid movie in one of my classes for school. And let me tell you that that stupid movie put almost everyone to sleep. It didn't interest anyone. And someone even put in their comment about 'Guess Who' that the movie sucked because Ashton Kutcher looked into the camera?? Okay.. um that doesn't make a movie bad ...its just means that your paying waay to much attention. I say its a good movie for teenagers because most teenagers haven't seen 'Guess Whos Coming To Dinner' because its old and Ashton Kutcher is HOTT ..so is Reggie! He may not be the best actor in the world but he gets by this movie just fine. And Bernie Mac is HALARIOUSS!\tNo  no  no!. What happen to you people? Again the same story about a man visiting the girlfriend's parents. Again and again. It seem's like the script was stolen from \""Meet the Parents\"" or another \""exactly the same\"" movie. I can't believe that! OK guys: we know that in Hollywood the new ideas doesn't appear  but this is ridiculous. If you not have ideas  donate the money  but this...Poor Ashton Kutcher: when it seemed that her work was ascending  again fall down. I don't know why filmed this movie: one year ago worked on \""My Boss's Daughter\"" (same comedies style).I have 5 stars because I'm a good man.\tI realize right off the bat that my 10 mark looks a bit to high. I admit it  this movie should really be something like an eight  but I have a specific marking style. You see  every film I see starts with a 10. If while I'm seeing it I can come up with something I would have done to make it better if I were making it then I take off a point. So  I say  \""I would have had better character development \"" there goes one point out the window for the film.If I can't think of a way that the film can be improved then it's kind of dumb if I start taking off points. Even if I didn't like the film  there is no way they could have made it any better.With this film I can't honestly come up with a way to improve it so it gets a 10. Also  I really enjoyed it  so that's always a plus. ;) Once again Bernie Mac finds himself in a pretty series/drama film  but this time  unlike with the film Mr. 3000  there is a lot of comedy. Now  remember this film is trying to be a drama above all  so even though there is a lot of comedy and you will chuckle quite a bit from time to time it never really reaches the you laughing your head off level so it can keep itself as the series film it needs to be. Now  that isn't to say there aren't a lot of over the top gags. There's tones of them. But  I found that most of the time they were down played and even though they were a bit out there they were still understandable scenes. So  this is not the funniest film you will see  but it's cute and it also has something else going for it.Yes  this is yet another remake. Maybe before you sit down to see this film you should try to brain wash yourself into thinking that this film is the first of its kind. I think it's more enjoyable that way. We're all a bit sick of the remakes.Well  anyways  the plot is this  Simon Green(Ashton) has just quit his job and is now meeting with Percy Jones(Bernie Mac) his soon to be father in law. Percy is a bigot  and proud of it. Needles to say he is not impressed with Simon being white  and not only that  but he soon clicks into the fact that Simon is lying about something  namely him quiting his job  and Percy starts his quest to expose Simon for the fraud that he is.We've all seen films before where they turn racial differences into a joke. Well  this is the other thing that the film has going for it. You see  with most of those other films they over do things and make it seem that everyone in a specific race loves rap and hip hop. Well  this just isn't true. This movie does not make fun of the groups that are being mistreated by racism. It does not turn them into the but of the joke by having them use countless hip hop terms and trying to be cool. It makes fun of racism itself. The insult becomes the but of the joke in this film and I couldn't be happier. Ashton doesn't come off as the white stereotype and Bernie doesn't come off as the black stereotype. They come off as regular Joes. In fact Bernie even reminded me of my dad at times. So the film is realistic in this sense and quite enjoyable in this sense to.Also  the film kind of tells it like it is  but it's a heart filled drama/comedy so it will never bring you down. Things that it points out to be true is that love isn't perfect and there is no happy ending  life is just on going  and there will always be racism and that we are just going to have to deal with it  like it or not. These themes are very true and illustrated well in the film. All you can do is kind of nod in agreement and then smile at the fact that the film still shows off the happier side of life.It's true that Bernie and Ashton play the same character they always do  so you wouldn't really want to call them very good actors  but hey  they are enjoyable and likable characters. They make the film.Well anyways  it had heart and was very enjoyable  so ya  a 10 fits well.\tI'm gonna put it like this  for those who haven't seen Guess Who's Coming To Dinner  plain and simple...WATCH THAT MOVIE FIRST AND LEAVE IT AT THAT!!!!!! The actors in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner acted brilliantly  it's a CLASSIC film. Not only was it HILARIOUS  it was very touching and real as well. Sadly  38 years later  they had the nerve to remake a classic comedy like Guess Who's Coming To Dinner and reverse racial roles. Guess Who. was far from hilarious. First off if you saw the original  you never saw Sidney Poitier in the same bed as Spencer Tracy  nor in the same bedroom for that matter. Guess Who was the opposite. In the original  all the parents met. In Guess Who  Ashton only mentions what his mom and grandma said about his future fianc\u00e9e. Sidney never ever argued with his fianc\u00e9e and then had the nerve to be desperate and sing horribly to get her back (not to mention make 35 cell phone calls). The most distasteful thing about Guess Who was the fact that they had to make a bunch of racial jokes with the black actors laughing. There was only one instance in Guess Who when Isabel Sanford called Sidney Poitier the N-word  but that was once. The fact is Guess Who was the WORST movie Bernie Mac ever starred it and it's a poor excuse for a remake. Guess Who's Coming To Dinner was a classic  pure  hilarious comedy without all the filth and sex-related humor  Guess Who was the opposite  PLAIN AND SIMPLE and that's it  ENOUGH SAID!!!\tA daughter brings her boyfriend home to meet the parents to announce their engagement. Problem is her family is black  her boyfriend  Simon Green (Kutcher) is white and she hasn't told them.The funny stuff was shown a million times in the promos. And  I can only remember two of those times  but they were pretty good. When I got to see the movie  that funny stuff wasn't as funny as before  and the rest of the movie was filled with tired old jokes  bad dialog  and an overpowering black father  Percy Jones (Mac). No one stood out except for Bernie Mac. He had all the good lines and overpowered everything  and no one challenged him. Now  that is okay  up to a point  and he did have cause to be upset -- his daughter brings home a white guy without telling anyone. But  Percy says he is more upset that Simon is hiding something and not that Simon is white.Kutcher brought absolutely nothing to the table and he should hope That 70s Show and that other one he is involved aren't canceled. The mother (Judith Scott)  and daughter (Zoe Saldana) had muted lines that are good enough for family TV  but no more than that. Oh  the acting was good  but the dialog suffered all throughout in that it was too bland. That is  the dialog suffered except for Bernie Mac's lines. Some were pretty good.Yes  this has similarities to Guess Who's Coming to Dinner  Meet the Parents  Meet the Fockers  but those shows  while not all that funny  were  at least  not bland. Okay  Guess Who's Coming To Dinner was nervously funny because of the time it played\u0085\u0085years ago...in the 1960s  I believe.\tYes indeed  I am one of the many who believe Ashton Kutcher to be right up there with the worst actors in cinema  but I decided to give this one a shot. Come on  how can anyone pass up the comedic genius of Bernie Mac? Unfortunately for us all  even the talent of Mr. Mac could not offset the 1-dimensional Kutcher and a script that has seemingly been put to film hundreds of times. Daughter brings home boyfriend/fianc\u00e9e. Father disapproves. The whole of the movie is the boyfriend groveling at the father's feet to try and pry some form of respect. What could the ending possibly be??? Not only is it not funny anymore. . .it's flat out aggravating! What can be learned from this film? The powers-that-be should banish Kutcher to some obscure cable TV network show (if that)  and Bernie Mac show return to working with those who have talent. . .on scripts that are worthy of his stature.\tI watched this movie expecting a light-hearted comedy. I enjoyed the additional complexity added to the characters played by Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher. Both actors did an excellent job in their roles  playing the characters realistically rather than over-the-top. Mac and Kutcher are definitely the highlight of this film.This film addresses the issue of race  particularly the interaction between whites and blacks in the U.S. Such is an inflammatory topic and the filmmakers deserve credit for tackling the topic without partisanship. It is played for comedic effect at times but ultimately is treated with respect.But I was disappointed that the female characters in the film were written as manipulative and deceptive. Whereas the arc involving Bernie Mac shows a man struggling to come to grips with the conflict between his love for his daughter and his feelings on race  the female characters are shown as conniving and inauthentic. This surprisingly misogynistic message clashes with the tone of the film.\tPercy Jones (Bernie Mac) is trying to protect his daughter Theresa (Zoe Saldana) from ending up with the wrong guy  and though he does a thorough background check on her new boyfriend Simon (Ashton Kutcher)  there's only one thing his research didn't tell him. He's white and he wants to marry his daughter.The \""meeting the parents\"" premise has been done to death recently with Monster-in Law and Meet the Fockers being the most recent films. However  what the film lacks in originality  it makes it up with laughs. There were a lot of funny moments and the movie hardly ever got boring. However  most of the funny bits were used in the trailer and this makes the jokes a little less effective since they are already expected. Also  the repeat value of the movie is very low. It's worth watching once but that's pretty much it. I don't think that's a bad thing since most light comedies are like that.I think the film works well because of the two leads. Both Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher give funny performances and they have nice chemistry together. Their scenes were the best and they never felt forced. Zoe Saldana also gives a good performance and she has come a long way from appearing in Crossroads. Most of the supporting actors are also funny including Judith Scott  who plays Bernie Mac's wife. Mike Epps also makes a cameo though it wasn't that good.Kevin Rodney Sullivan directs and he only does an okay job. The first half of the film is pretty funny and the racial issues are handled lightly. During the second half  the film becomes all serious and it's kind of awkward. The director ditches the laughs for awhile and he approaches the issue in a mature manner. It kind of works but some of the serious scenes felt fake. It seemed like the actors were about to burst out laughing at any second and the film also got kind of dull. The ending was surprisingly strong though. The changes of tone in the film worked out okay but they weren't as effective as they could have been. In the end  Guess Who is worth a rental  nothing more though. Rating 7/10\tSimon Jones (Ashton Kutcher \u0096 The Butterfly Effect) is a successful stock trader very much in love with his fianc\u00e9e Theresa (Zoe Saldana \u0096 Pirates of the Caribbean) but one small problem creeps up when she brings him home to me her folks (Bernie Mac and Judith Scott)  he's white and they're not. Hilarity ensues in this remake of \""Guess Who's Coming for Dinner\"".Well what can I say? \""Guess Who\"" does have some funny moments mostly due to characters in uncomfortable situations than anything. Many of the race jokes were just petty and childish  perfect for an Ashton Kutcher film. Mac and Kutcher do however riff off each other pretty well but it's very hard (nay impossible) to see Kutcher as a romantic lead no matter how bumbling he presents it. \""Guess Who\"" is another tepid remake short on real laughs.\tGuess Who was a good comedy/drama that had to do with father/daughter issues as well as racial issues very well. The characters didn't skirt around the issues  they actually talked about them candidly  which of course got them in trouble sometimes. Of course  BernieMac and Ashton Kutcher were very good in their roles. BernieMac was very good at being the concerned father (and a little insane) about his daughter's relationship and he definitely didn't pretend to be happy when he wasn't. Ashton Kutcher was very convincing at trying to impress his girlfriend's father and get him to like him. There were quite a few very funny moments mostly between BernieMac and Ashton Kutcher. I'm not going to say anything about the end except that I thought it was very original.\tHere's some neat facts about the movie  which had some exterior shots of my hometown in Cranford (where's it's based out of). -The police patches and badge style of the officer in the go-cart scene were authentic (except the 8 point hat). The large patch on the police car matched the real Cranford police patch  but the design of the police car did not match Cranford's (black and white's). -The taxi in the beginning of the movie made a left turn onto North Avenue against the lane markings (after passing under the NJ Transit Bridge). Surprised that didn't make it into the \""goof's\"" area. Overall  I really didn't believe that Bernie Mac's character didn't like Ashton's character. He wasn't cold enough. Bernie was trying to be funny  and their on-screen interaction wasn't distant enough. Ashton's just the same spaz character throughout each movie he's in. But  at least they're two big names for this remake.\tSimon Green (Ashton Kutcher)  A Wall Street Player on the rise. Simon is in love with an beautiful African American woman by the name of Theresa (Zoe Saldana). Simon is about the Meet the Parents of his girlfriend  Percy Jones (Bernie Mac) and his wife (Judith Scott). When Percy is Shocked at his daughter that she's dating a white guy. Percy is trying to find If Simon is a fake. While Simon trying to know Theresa's father  Percy is pushing Simon as far as he can. Since Percy is trying to enjoy his 25th wedding anniversary.Direcred by Kevin Rodney Sullivan (Barbershop 2:Back in Business  How Stella Got Her Groove Back) made an enjoyable comedy with a well cast role for Bernie Mac playing the Spencer Tracy role. Guess Who is a loose remake of the 1967 interracial romance \""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\"". The film has the occasional quick hit gag (Like songs \""Walk on the Wild Side\"") with some hilarious moments between Mac and Kutcher. Kutcher and Saldana make a lovely couple in the film.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an fine-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an running commentary track by the director  deleted scenes with optional director's commentary  outtakes and more. The film is wildly uneven but entertaining just the same. The film's highlight:When Simon tells Black Jokes at the dinner table (Which some is funny and some are tasteless) but you wish Percy made some White Jokes also. If you want to see a lighter subject to a Hot Topic  you may enjoy this. (*** \u00bd/*****).\tWhile I enjoyed the original well enough (1967  with Sidney Poitier)  it was a bit too serious. Yes  inter-racial relationships  especially marriage  might be seen by some as a serious situation  but even in 1967  would a family *really* have handled it like they did in the film? It seemed a forced and ingenuous storyline. On the other hand  this one (Guess Who  2005) lays it all out on the table and is absolutely hilarious. There's no stepping on eggshells or worry about \""political correctness.\"" The characters simply call a spade a spade ... and honky a honky for that matter! The joke scene at the dinner table was side-splitting. It was just more realistic than the original ... and realistic almost always equals \""funny.\"" I also thoroughly appreciated the reason for Simon (Kutcher) leaving his job at the first of the film. It builds respect for the character in the eyes of Percy (Mac) as well as the audience. A very good romantic comedy that I think I would even pay to watch again in the theater. A very nice addition to a RomCom hound's personal library.\tI really recommend this movie to anyone. I think that Theresa and Simon have a very realistic relationship that I could truly see one of my friends in a relationship like theirs. Like real love  they have their ups and downs  their awkward moments  and their little fights and all those little things that make it a real and believable love and not just a movie love. It's not your typical fantasy life is not really like a chick flick movie. It is a good mix between comedy and the tough stuff. Simon seems to really love Theresa and you can really tell that they are good for each other and compliment each other. I'm kinda a romantic and like the fantasy chick flicks  but this one is probably one of my favorites because the relationships and situations are what love is really about and how it is to want to make that good first impression on your future in-laws. Bernie Mac plays a great dad and reacts like a real father would when meeting his daughter's boyfriend for the first time. One of my favorite lines of his was when Ashton says  \""You knew you were going to kick me out a week ago?\"" and Bernie replies  \""Boy  I knew I was going to kick you out 24 years ago when the doctor announced it was a girl.\"" That just seems like something a real father would say. So overall  I love this movie and recommend it to anyone. Don't let the chick flick part turn you away  it's more realistic than most. To me  this movie is not mainly about the race issue  or any other issue other than love and the love of two people wanting to spend the rest of their lives together and trying to work their two worlds into one.\tThe most insulting thing about this movie is that it purports to be a re-make of the 1967 classic \""Guess Whose Coming to Dinner.\"" That movie  starring the late Spencer Tracy in his last role  the late Katherine Hepburn and Sidney Poiter dealt with the issue of race as real people would do. The original was made during a time of racial tensions in this country. Tracy's moving speech at the end of the original 1967 movie brought it all together for me.Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher do not deal with race seriously. This movie is not about social justice like the original. The jokes are not funny. Mac seems too grouchy and Kutcher is not funny. Kutcher's girlfriend and Mac's wife do not seem like real people. This movie has no soul and for a rental it was money poorly spent.\tThe reason I rented this movie from Blockbuster  was I wanted to watch a 'soft' romantic-comedy movie  and because I have similar experience where my Black mom is not properly accepted by my dad's White family. In other words  it's racial theme  and how I identified with it  was what attracted me to watch this movie. However  the 'genre' of the film is a 'comedy' and not a 'drama'  so if expecting some sort of dramatic theme with a deep treatment on the subject  you will be very disappointed.As a romantic-comedy - it's merits is whether it is 'funny'  and if it had any 'magical moments' or 'touching scenes'  what would seem 'romantic. In terms of comedy I personally did not find the movie funny - it seemed very predictable  and there were no surprise's. However  there were black jokes and the 'obvious' hypocrisy of the Black family seemed remotely amusing. In terms of the 'romantic' it seems to be an inferior version of the 'Meet the Parents' series  only with a racial twist. It seemed to be a Hollywood money-maker (or a B-type movie).On a positive note  there was no real swearing  violence  and nobody getting hurt of blown-up and no drugs or sex. However  I usually take away points if these are present as opposed to adding points if they are absent.I do not recommend buying  renting this film unless you can borrow it for free at the library or watch it on TV.\tI suppose I shouldn't admit this  but after seeing the trailers for \""Guess Who\"" some months ago  I figured it would just be very light entertainment with a lot of slapstick humor. I was mistaken. The director has done a good job of presenting a situation which involves \""race relations\""  but gradually turns it into sharp focus on \""what is love?\"" Bernie Mac is Percy Jones  New Jersey bank loan officer and loving but hard-nosed dad. He has an artist daughter Theresa (very pretty Zoe Saldana) who is bringing her boyfriend home to meet her parents during their 25th anniversary re-dedication party. What she neglects to tell them ahead of time (\""I didn't think it would make any difference!\"") is that he is Simon Green  a very white Wall Street investor. The funny scene that is in the trailers  where the cab shows up and Percy automatically assumes the black guy is the boyfriend and the white guy is the cab driver. So  much of the movie is about Simon trying to please Percy  because he is mad about Theresa and  they are hesitant to announce  are planning to get married. But Percy doesn't trust this white guy.SPOILERS. Simon also has a big secret  and he deceives Theresa  because he quit his nice job right before they left for NJ. We don't find out why until near the end of the movie  but it was because Simon's boss had made a big deal of his girlfriend being black  and Simon quit in defense of Theresa's honor. When Percy eventually figures that out  he accepts Simon and everyone ends up happy. In between  Percy sleeps with Simon on the basement fold-out  to \""protect\"" his daughter. There is a funny  but tense  scene over dinner where Percy dares Simon to repeat the ethnic jokes he has heard  and everyone laughs until ... \""What are three things that a black man can't get?\"""""
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004),"As a Potter fan  the world is a rather sad place to be hanging around. It's a matter of principle  no more  no less. The refuge one may find in the books is comforting in an enchanting way  but can the films be so as well? After watching HP's one and two  nay was all that I could say. Both films were somewhat played down in quite a few regards and despite differing only in details from the books  they both achieved the tremendous performance of boring me to a paralysis-like state. Surely enough  there were things I liked  but reality and fantasy remained two separate things: you can't get a Harry Potter without taking him from the muggle world and the muggle world simply needs time to learn and to grow up. And they did  all of them  those little brats  all for Harry's sake and under Cuaron's guidance! What makes HP 3 a much more enjoyable ride is the sense of existence with which the characters are finally bestowed. They are leading a life of their own and the kids finally learned how to show that on screen - obviously  with Cuaron's help  who was more than able to reinvent Rowling's universe in a way only a true visionary could've done. Columbus wasn't up to the task  for all that mattered in his case was the frame and not the painting itself! It's very important to be able to guide children and the only real way to do it is by making it feel natural. So Cuaron did.The third book is probably the best one to film due to the plot  mainly. That's one of the reasons why it plays out so well as a movie. But the fact that the kids have started to grasp the basic concepts of acting and the stunning visuals create a new world for us to taste have had an undeniable positive influence upon the end result. This new film is good because it finally shares the spirit of the book: the innocent hope  the complicated issues of life (and death)  the reasons which make us tick the way we do. It's a step in discovering who the heck you really are  who the heck Harry is and what he is becoming. The \wise words of Dumbledore\"" are always powerful and mysterious  in the sense they really should be. And it's good this way  because there so much more behind them and we want to want to be intrigued. That's what Cuaron managed to do  he created a world which leaves enough unanswered questions as there can be. Finally someone who understands the essence of the book. Finally something fresh and exciting. That's the way HP is supposed to be!\tAt first  I didn't care for it. Too many things taken out and the plot was almost ruined.But then after the third time seeing it  I realized it wasn't too bad at all. Alfonso really did a fantastic job. And after watching interviews  I found out that JK Rowling was happy with what turned out. If my favorite author is happy  I'm happy. She even liked the things Alfonso and the screenwriter added in that she didn't write in the books. I myself loved the whole shrunken head concept.I absolutely love all the special effects. Buckbeak  the Hippogriff  looked so realistic. Those Dementors gave me goosebumps. I cried when Sirius Black (played by the awesome Gary Oldman) almost got his soul sucked out at the lake. The moving paintings and photos are also a real treat in the movie.Daniel Radcliffe  Rupert Grint  Emma Watson  and Tom Felton are some of the best teen actors I've ever seen. Daniel deals with all that pressure really well  being the star. Rupert Grint  hot like Daniel except in my opinion  hotter  gives comic relief throughout the movie that made me and my friends laughed at over and over again. Emma has really matured a lot and does a great job but I think they are showing more Emma and less Hermione which  plainly  isn't good. Tom Felton  another British heart throb  plays Draco Malfoy  a snobby  rich  mean Slytherin student who thinks too highly of himself. Tom plays the role very well  but we all know he has a heart of gold outside of acting  right?We also meet some new actors in the third movie. Michael Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore. He will never be as great as Richard  but I suppose he did an acceptable job. Garry Oldman  who plays the framed Sirius Black  does a good job. Timothy Spall  the sniveling Peter Pettigrew  who turns out to be Ron's rat and also he framed Sirius  does a good job but I think they made him look too ugly. I didn't expect him be handsome  but I didn't expect him to look disgusting either.I really loved this movie  being a huge Harry Potter fan and all. But I think even people who don't like the books would love this movie too  because it's deeper than wands and brooms. There are messages about life in these movies and books that make people think and learn.\tA real disappointment if you're a true fan of the books. If you don't read the books or didn't completely follow the previous movies  it'll be confusing. It was well-directed and really looked like the Hogwarts the books portray  but the acting is terrible and the plot-line is hard to follow. The movie has been built up to be a comedy and teen romance flick  where the plot line is thrown to the side  into the background  making it difficult to understand.First  the few good points: The directing was above average in this film and it's obvious that this is an improvement from the previous movies. Hogwarts is made out as it should be  following the books  again  unlike the last 2 Harry Potter movies. But this is really all that is good.The many  many bad points: The animation is absolutely terrible and completely fake. The movie has been so clouded up by unnecessary details that the main plot line is left in the dark  difficult to follow and  so the movie is made out to be  unimportant. If you're a fan of the books  this is a huge disappointment. As a matter of fact  if you've read the books  I strongly suggest you not go and see the movie. It will ruin your view of the Harry Potter novels and if watched enough  confuse you from what is important.\tAlfonso Cuar\u00f3n claims that the film didn't need to be 3-4hrs long; well I have to admit he may be correct; the only problem is he forgot to explain what the hell was going on?He said that a novel-to-screen adaptation is the Directors viewpoint on how to best tell the story. Well that's fine  but you still need to actually tell the story. Don't you? Not one person  who saw the film  without reading the books  understood what was going on half the time  and the few sub-plots he left in weren't explained in any way  shape or form that could be understood but an outside observer! So doesn't that contradict his whole Directors Viewpoint theory?Cuar\u00f3n was just showing off his excellent film making skills (No I'm not being sarcastic!) and decided to say F*#K YOU to all the Big Name Hollywood Directors by making a Art-House style Blockbuster  which would have been great  if he had bothered to pay attention to the actual story  instead of just concentrating on all the stupid things he chose to shoot instead! Don't get me wrong they were amazing  but so much time consuming crap was put into the film  that could have been spent on  you know  Harry Potter instead of showing off to the world that he's an excellent director... WE KNOW YOU ARE MATE! YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HIRED FOR THE JOB IF YOU WERN'T...He made some excellent & much needed changes to the films  and we all must be grateful for that  but by trying to make a more intelligent film  (Which he did) he robbed us of many wonderful aspect of the Harry Potter world! Things we were all looking forward to being brought to life on the big screen...And as if that wasn't bad enough  he convinced Mike Newell to make GOF (Which is the same size as books 1  2 & 3  combined) into a 2 1/2 hour movie!?! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't let him near another Harry Potter film ever again!\tDon't get me wrong  I do think this is a very good movie. It's well directed  the music is excellent  the acting is great; however  I don't feel as though it's got the same \""Harry Potter\"" feel as the first two  Columbus's two.For me  the first two Harry Potter movies \""felt\"" perfect  they felt right. To be frank  they felt like Harry Potter! I've read the books a dozen times each  and from what I read  I had my own vision of what Harry's world would be like. Chris captured it amazingly  exactly as I'd imagined it. Alfonso's was OK  but he seems to have changed an awful lot and tried too hard to get the movie into a \""new\"" style  his style. This  I feel  is why I'm opposed to his version to Chris's. However  despite all that  the movie is very good (excellent for the last 30 minutes). The acting is good  and the movie moves at a great pace; you really feel it has been a year at Hogwarts. There are a handful of \""cringe-worthy\"" moments  which really bug me. You'll know them when you see them  trust me.Anyway  definitely see this movie and form your own opinion. It's not all bad  seriously. I just wish Chris had directed it  I have the strange feeling it would of been better and \""fitted\"" in with the first two.(4/5)\tHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is part of the highest caliber in literature. One that not only appeals to every age group; but shines with an excellent storyline full of plot twists and imagination. This book is part of the current most popular book series that has possibly ever existed. It is expected that the film interpretation of this book would be critically acclaimed with cleverness and great appeal to all audiences. Unfortunately this is not the case.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is directed by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. After the first two movies were directed by Chris Columbus it seemed that films were not good enough for the plus- 10 million dollars that he was being paid. This turned out to be a dreadful mistake on Warner Brothers part. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n was definitely the bad choice to head the multi million dollar production that is \""The prisoner of Azkaban\"". It is still questioned why Cuar\u00f3n was hired for this job with his mere credentials being several low budget films  The Little Princess and the very disturbing Y Tu Mama Tabien. Cuar\u00f3n brought his very unusual styles of directing to the mix. He adds very unusual cuts and makes a sub-par interpretation that would make writer J.K. Rowling ashamed. He doesn't bring the appropriate seriousness to the film as it often seems like a joke.The film begins with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) now 13 years old  starting his third year at Hogwarts. The wizarding world has been shaken up  due to the recent escape of Sirius Black from the wizarding prison of Azkaban. The significance of Black is that he was the person convicted of leading the dark Lord Voldemort to Harry's parents. It is believed that he is bent on finishing his task by killing Harry as well. Adding to Harry's troubles are phantom like creatures called Dementors. These heartless beings are sent to guard Hogwarts from Sirius Black. With all the stress of these terrifying beings and the person who gave away his parents location which lead to their death; Harry has become angry. No longer a helpless child Harry has grown up to become a darker and more powerful person.Harry reunites with his two best friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine (Emma Watson) to continue the wonders of Hogwarts Wizarding School. Harry is helped by the new defense against the dark arts teach Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) to learn to defend himself against Sirius Black and the treacherous Dementors. Harry doesn't ever seem to catch a break as his troubles only get worse.The movie overall is decent  the acting is surprisingly good for the young actors and the more experienced actors Robbie Coltrane  Alan Rickman  Maggie Smith and Gary Oldman all do terrific jobs of portraying their characters. However after the death of Richard Harris the role of Dumbledore was given to Micheal Gambon. Gambon however does in my opinion an inaccurate portrayal of the Headmaster failing to show the wisdom and care that Harris brought to the screen. Even so his appearances in the book are minimal as he does not affect the film in a big way. The CGI effects in this movie are excellent as the visual effects seem to get better and better. The realism in the broomstick flying and the creatures are phenomenal and the effects team deserves a pat on the back. Overall this movie is worth seeing for any Harry Potter fan  and should appeal for the average person to see it at least once. Unfortunately is seems like the opportunity to make a great film was squandered by Director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n and it is disappointing to watch and think \""what could have been a great movie\""\tThis movie was OKAY but it could be better. If you've read the books then you'll see how much detail was skipped completely. Like when Harry gets his Firebolt broomstick at the end. He was supposed to get that in the middle of the movie. They also skipped about three quidditch matches that were somewhat important for the movie. Sirius Black was also supposed to infiltrate the castle TWICE. He was supposed to get inside the boys' dormitory and be standing over Ron Weasley with a 12 inch hunter's knife. But this movie was also better than the last two because in my opinion  the new actor for Albus Dumbledore was better than the last.\tHarry Potter 3 was horrible!. I hate the new director. The ending was terrible  and I really don't think it followed the plot of the book too well. I know  I know  it's only BASED on the book  but still  he could have done a better job. Hopefully  the 4th movie is a bit better. i also didn't really like the fact that they didn't wear their robes.. And I don't really remember them making weird noises in their bedrooms. Some of it was okay though  but still  someone needs to fire that director and get the old one back. Some people say that the new Dumbledore was pretty bad  but he seemed okay to me. Actually he seemed to be the only okay thing about the movie.\tI started my career as a Harry Potter fan at the age of 6. When I discovered that they would be made into movies  I immediately felt hesitant to see them. What if they were completely manipulated? Changed around? What if the actors and actresses were no good? Fortunately  I was not disappointed. Though many things were changed about the movies  they left all of the important things in there  while throwing in several new twists. This movie is no exception. I was delighted at how well everything was portrayed. Almost exactly as I had read it. I was delighted at the wonderful one-liners thrown in  and was completely mystified by the concept of going back in time. Yet another spectacular feeling was fear. The dementors  the fear of facing a boggart  and the idea of having a killer looking for you are quite terrifying. The stars of this series may be growing up  but they still manage to act out the characters magnificently.However  I have one suggestion; If you haven't read the book  you may find this movie to be VERY frightening. But if you are a Harry Potter fan  you shouldn't be bothered when everything starts to mysteriously turn to ice...\tI just recently watched HP and the Prisoner again this past week  after finishing the latest book. I was struck by how wonderfully magical the filming of this instalment has been created with fade in's (don't see many of those anymore)  hilarious bridging scenes with the Whomping Willow  and the clock / time theme throughout. This HP movie has a vivid sense of humour playing against the rapid plot  and a screenplay that does a brilliant job of pulling together all the critical elements of Rowling's story. It's a daunting task to recreate something that has played through so many people's imaginations  but Prisoner has done a fantastic job.\tI think that this movie shows A lot of potential and I really enjoyed watching it. I mean the fact that someone can do magic is a little unrealistic but it fun! And it makes want to believe. Actually it MAKES you believe. The graphics were also amazing and the casting  it couldn't have been better! It also followed the basics of the book and also had character building  in which I mean you could tell that the actors really felt their characters. For anyone who hasn't watched the movie I suggest you watch and the first 2 movies as well  you should also read the books  they are amazing! (There are currently 6 of them) I hope that you enjoy Harry Potter as much as I did!\tFor a film dealing with wizardry and witchery this film is totally lacking in any kind of magic. Instead the screen is filled busy busy busy with twitching  flying  and whirring CGI gimmicks and whizbangs The whole movie is layered so deep  and cluttered up with special effects that there is precious room for anything else.The camera never stops moving too. Nearly every shot in this flick the camera is dollying  tilting  or on a crane  or on a steady cam. The only time the camera stops whanging around all over the place is when our hero faints - which he does with monotonous regularity.For all the effort that went into this film (and technically it is very impressive) I doubt if I will remember a single frame of it in a weeks time. There wasn't a single arresting image  line  or bit of business in the whole 7 hours.A mechanical  soulless bit of movie making which requires no imaginative input from the viewer.\tOkay  so I've read all the harry potters and i was a pretty big fan of 1 and 2. i finally got hold of harry potter 3. i wish i hadn't. this movie sucked ass. normally these movies follow the books? this one obviously enjoys a free-spirit(name of my bike) and decided to screw the book and go as off tangent as possible. and i also wanted to know whose bright idea was it to put harry in that pathetic yeah! pose at the end of the movie? was that supposed to be clever? i didn't find it clever at all. in fact  i thought it was pretty much retarded. This movie was up on my sh*t list along with Midnight Mass. those two movies are of equal quality  if anyone actually knows movies in here instead of just saying you like movie because it relates to a series of book everyone loves. quit succumbing to the pressure of society and think for yourself for once! yeah i kinda succumbed to the pressure and gave it a 2. it got a star because it was harry potter  if you could pick 0  it would've gotten a 1 from me.\tThis movie is outstanding! There is a lot of suspense and many exciting parts! Some younger children might be scared of the dementors and other creepy parts  but children 10 and over should be fine. The movie is almost as good as the book by the same name which was written by JK ROwling. Many parts from the book are included in the movie. An interesting thing about the movie compared to the other two is that the actors are wearing normal \""Muggle\"" (non-wizard) clothes instead of the Hogwarts robes. I think that this takes away from the \""magic\"" of the movie  but the movie is good just the same. This movie is a must-see especially if you have read the book!!!!\tMany people have done it before  ruin a great book by making a film about it  but this is by far one of the worst book movies ever. I love the Harry Potter books  every single one of them has a sort of magic that's very rare  a magic that both kids and adults like. The movies on the other hand  are a totally different story.The first movie was  well  OK  it wasn't bad  but it was no Lord of the Rings. The second one was a bit worse  but still  fun to watch  but the third  my god what were they thinking when making this movie?My thought is that they took the book  took some elements from it  the ending  the beginning  and some other small things that affected the story line and rewrote a completely new book from there on  because almost everything has been done differently. Now this could be a good thing  if the book wasn't the best Harry Potter book and virtually impossible to improve.So what has gone wrong you wonder  well  nearly everything. It starts at scene one  where harry blows up his aunt  the book didn't say she flew away and was never to be seen. And so it goes on  Harry doesn't spend weeks in London  now it's only a day  we don't see him  Hermione and Ron going shopping in Diagon Alley  and Harry finds out about Black in a totally different way.And the trend goes on  most things changing slightly  but some major events changing big time.One thing that probably annoyed me the most  was the ending  it sucked with a capital S. Harry get's his new broom and flies off. What  but didn't Black give that to him halfway his year  and didn't he won the quidditch season with it. Yes  but apparently not in this movie  in this movie there is no quidditch  except for the first match. In this movie  Harry is just scared of the dementors and that's the reason he's learning the Patronus charm. But why should he be  the dementors aren't allowed at school grounds by Dumbledore  so he has nothing to fear. I think they just wanted to squeeze the broom into the movie  and by doing so  ruining in ending.Now  if the story was all that went wrong  that would be one thing  but there are so many things  bad acting  bad lighting  bad casting (Emma Thompson never convinced me as Trelawney)  David Thewlis wasn't bad  but good no. The only one who really convinced me was Gary Oldman. I really saw him as Sirius Black. Of the three main players  Rupert Grint was the best  Emma Watson wasn't bad either  Radcliffe  how in gods name he became Potter will always remain a mystery to me. But this was his worst acting performance by far.And so what do we have after 2 hours of film. Well  I really don't know  if you know the story line  the movie is entertaining  but nothing more than that  and if you don't know the story line  you never will  because everything is rushed into. It's a big book  and they fitted it in 2 hours  but that won't work. Nobody cares if it's a 3 hour movie  I didn't care with movies like LotR  and I wouldn't care with Harry Potter  even better  I'd love a 3 hour movie  but make it a Potter movie.What the makers tried was to make a film both enjoyable for the Potter fans who had read the book at least once  and to the lesser fans as well  who had only seen the movies. And this movie is a disappointment to both. The real fans will see a ruining of a brilliant book  and the movie fans will see a movie without a storyline. I'm really sorry I have to rate a Potter movie like this  even more because the third book is still my favorite one. But that's how it is  hopefully part 4 will be better  otherwise they might try to get Peter Jackson to direct the movie  because otherwise  I have little hope.\tGone is Chris Columbus and so enters Alfonso Cuaron. Strike up the band  paint a banner  and the parade will be here in a few minutes.I have nothing against Columbus (haha thats where i live)  but from the way chamber of secrets was going  it looked like the franchise was going to get a little stale. So gone are the bright colors and blockbuster soundtrack and cheap special effects of the first two movies and in comes the new artsy  darker look of Prizoner of Azkaban.Cuaron wasted no time in changing things to suit his needs however. Gone are the gentle rolling hills surrounding Hogwarts and in place of them are more extreme mountains. Hagrid's hut is down a hill that was nonexistent in the other movies  and the castle now includes a courtyard  a giant clock  and a large elevated walkway that leads to seemingly no where. These changes aren't necessarily bad  but they hurt the continuity of the series. Also  the entire tone of the movie is different  as the kids grow older and more mature.At first viewing  I didn't really like this movie as much as the other ones  mostly Sorceror's Stone. But when I thought about it  and as I read the 6th book  I realized that Harry's world isn't always a bright and colorful world with a blockbuster soundtrack and cheap special effects. So in a way  this movie provides a nice transition between the first books of the series and the later more darker ones  at least for the movies.Personally  I loved the new sound of the soundtrack. John Williams remains as fresh as ever and the medieval styled music is very good and appropriate  combined with the old themes.Some things are sorely missed though. One thing in particular  is Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Michael Gambon is by no means a bad actor  but him as Dumbledore wearing a beanie just doesn't work. Richard Harris' dumbledore had that warmth and authority that perfectly caught the essence of the character portrayed in the books. There's nothing they can do about it  but I think Ian McKellen would have been a better choice  or maybe even Patrick Stewart.The only thing that makes this movie a little subordinate to the Sorceror's Stone is the end  which i thought lacked a little substance and could have been better given how the book ended. There were just a few little things that it could have added to make it that much more powerful  but they decided to make the movie that much shorter. Still  this is a very good movie and I eagerly anticipate the next movie. Mischief managed.\tWith an entirely different director  followed by a different style  the third installment of the Harry Potter series had people questioning whether or not this film would be as entertaining and refreshing as its predecessors. As for me  it not only was entertaining  but seemed better and more adult than its predecessors.When comparing such a movie to its original novel  it's hard to say how along the lines this particular movie followed. With several crucial missing parts  it left faithful Potter fans to throw their popcorn cartons to the screen  and babbling about Cuaron's terrible job on the movie. I  having read the series  do agree that the film could have done well and made more sense with what had been cut. However  most forget to think of this movie as a movie alone--with no thought of the novel from which it was derived. Instead of comparing it to its novel twin  comparing it with its predecessors would be more accurate.As the series progresses  the stories  therefore the movies  get better  as well as the acting abilities. As the stories continue to get darker  the characters continue to mature. Radcliffe's performance  unfortunately  was a bit of a disappointment. Having improved since \""Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone\""  his performance was still less than expected for the third installment and for the character he plays. He is Harry Potter  after all.Watson continues to improve  and she does not disappoint in her performance as Hermione Granger. She has grown to be one of the finest and most respectable teenage actresses for this generation. Grint has a natural talent for being Ron Weasley. It was almost as if he were born to play the part. He IS Ron. His performance was one of the most entertaining in the entire film. Comic relief is an important part in films which consist mainly of darker matters  which is what Ron brings to the film.The style in which this movie was set--more casual and laid back--was really appealing. It was refreshing to see that Hogwarts students aren't always in uniform  and everything is really comforting. This was by far the best way I have seen a Harry Potter film. Cuaron should have directed all three films. His style of directing was really riveting.Thus  I give Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban a 9/10 rating. Fantabulous.\tThis Harry Potter was really good. I enjoyed watching it and the plot was just as interesting as the first two. It followed the book and it was very well put together. But this movie was different from the first two movies. This one felt more...\""dark.\"" I think this may be because of the plot  and how disturbing it is to Harry  so I think that is why it's different from the other two Harry Potter movies. The acting was a lot more dramatic in this movie. I think the events of the story engage this more dramatic acting. I was extremely impressed by all the actors and seen how they've improved from the previous films. All in all this movie was great. I recommend it to all Harry Potter fans.\tHarry Potter is back and this time it's more enjoyable than the first two movies. To be honest here  I actually like this movie. I was never a fan of the first two movies because they concentrated on bringing eye gawky teenage girls than actually caring for a story  but the special effects and John Williams' music made things up for me. All the principal actors from the first two movies return; Daniel Radcliffe  Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are back as Harry  Hermione  and Ron in which the story behind the Prisoner of Azkaban is that a killer name Sirus Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the prison of Azkaban in which he is after Harry Potter and wants to kill him. Harry isn't scared  as he is ready to kill the murderer who is after him. With an all-star cast featuring Emma Thompson as a teacher and Michael Gambon replacing the late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledor  the acting is superb in which not only the three main actors have matured  and the special effects and John Williams' music are ten times better than the first two.If you enjoyed the first two movies  that's fine. But I recommend this for fans and non-fans alike to see this movie.\tI think this isn't the best harry Potter film  because the characters are sometimes not like the book and many important things are selected.But the three child actors have been great. Only the screenplay is wrong. I think Rupert Grint is the best actor of this movie and i do not understand  that he wasn't nominated for any award. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson were nominated   why not Rupert? And sometimes the window blinds don't work like they should. And why there is a choir  it isn't any in the book? Did the director or want to lose more time???? And I think the child actors will be to old in the next film  but casting new kids isn't right  too."""
Helen of Troy (2003),"The movie Helen of Troy  released in 2003 and directed by John Kent Harrison was definitely a spectacular movie. There was an excellent cinematography and exceptional portrayal of the actors to their respective roles. The movie is basically about Helen (Sienna Guillory) fleeing away with Paris (Matthew Marsden) to Troy and the war between the Greeks and the Trojans. The movie was depicted in Meneleus' point of view which made the movie more interesting. A scene from the film that really struck me was the rape of Helen by Agamemnon. That scene was really appalling and it showed again the evil side of Agamemnon and how he really desired Helen. It also showed how Meneleus cares for Heln and that he really loves her. The rape of Helen by Agamemnon is a metaphor for Troy. Both Helen and Troy suffered greatly. Helen suffered from Agamemnon and that she was unable to fight back. She also suffered when Paris died and when her own father disowned her. On the other hand  Troy suffered from the Greeks. Its people and riches were exploited until nothing was left. Helen was considered the most beautiful woman on earth while Troy was the most prosperous city and the center of trade in the Mediterranean. But outside forces destroyed them.Overall  the movie was impressive. It had a great cinematography; the scenes were shot in picturesque places and it also had amazing effects that further beautified the movie. The actors were successful in playing their respective roles. Having the story from Meneleus' point of view gave the movie a new approach and made it different from other movies of the same plot. The scenes were also beautifully directed that were effective in capturing the attention of the audience and made them hooked to the movie.\tHelen of Troy \u0096 Revealed Helen of Troy is a film of action  romance  adventure and drama which was directed by John Kent Harrison and was written by Ronni Kern . Helen of Troy is about a young girl named Helen who is the daughter of Zeus and Leda \u0096 wife of Tyndareus. The movie started with the birth of Paris who was thrown to the cliff because her sister  Cassandra  had a vision that if he lives  Troy will burn. Fortunately  a man picked up Paris and he raised him as if he is his own child. Paris came to Troy to fight for his bull and he was able to find out that he's the lost son of King Priam. When he was about to leave Mycenae  he brought with him Helen  the wife of Menelaus. Because of her  the war started and many lives were sacrificed. In the end  she went back with Menelaus to their home. It is a fast phased story which is told on Menelaus' point of view. Achilles is a war-loving man who always wanted to settle an argument by the means of killing each other. King Priam  on the other hand  is a noble and generous king who treated Helen with respect  and if family \u0096 centered.The movie was effective in delivering the story to the people. They emphasized some scenes which are meant to be highlighted. The script was not really that effective because some lines don't have any sense at all. The sound effects had a great impact which supported the important scenes. As for my over-all rating  I'll give this film a 4 film reels. It is good enough to watch  and like other movies  it has different genres. Helen of Troy doesn't only focuses on the action part but also the emotional/dramatic scenes.\t\Helen of Troy\""\u0085a very stunning film  which was directed by John Kent Harrison  is a story which focuses mainly on romance  action  drama and adventure. It was first viewed last April 20  2003. This motion picture was actually a re-enactment of a modernized kind of myth. Originally it was taken from the Greek Mythology and it is an exclusive version taken from Homer's Iliad. \""A face that launched a thousand ships.\"" \u0085This is the main essence of the story Helen of Troy. Literally every man  even her brother Pollux  fell in love with her because of her incomparable beauty. But little do they know that being Leda and Zeus' daughter  this woman thus brings wrath to people's lives. Thus  a ten year conflict was initiated. Although virtues were also shown during the whole conflict  each man's desire to have the most beautiful wife on earth still reigned  therefore leading to their own demise. Men showed their braveness and their loyalty to their land. They fought all the way through just to attain their goal in obtaining Helen. But in doing so  their egoism still stood out. For instance  King Agamemnon led his people to Troy thus making him look brave and heroic. But little do his men know about his hidden agenda in getting Helen back not for his brother  Menelaus  but for his own pleasure and contentment. In overall evaluation  the film in my opinion should be rated 4 out of 5 stars. The major concept of the story was successfully shown through the dialogue of the characters. The actors/actresses were just right for their role in executing their assigned characters. However  the cinematography could have been better in terms of better lighting and adding more sound effects for the viewers to truly grasp the essence of the film. But generally it is an excellent film that should be watched by everyone who wants to be entertained and be familiar with Homer's Iliad.\tLast July 28  2005  we watched the movie Helen of Troy. Helen of Troy is a historical romance and adventure movie portrayed by magnanimous actors and actresses like Sienna Guillory(Helen) and Matthew Marsden(Paris). It was directed by John Harrison and was released last 2003. We watched it for around two hours and fifty-seven minutes. The story is mainly about the fairest woman  Helen  who had been the reason of igniting a war between the Trojans and the Spartans. Helen has a husband who is the King of Sparta  Menelaus. Helen didn't love Menelaus because he was madly in love with Prince Paris of Troy. So one day  when Menelaus was out  Helen ran away with Paris and went off to Troy  the city of Byzantium riches and spices. The husband discovered it and he decided to attack Troy  with his brother as the chieftain  Agamemnon. Together  they led the war between the Trojans and Spartans that endured for ten years. On the tenth year  Agamemnon wanted to fight no more so he proposed peace. He let Menelaus and Paris fight over the woman they both love. Paris got wounded but Menelaus  kind-hearted  didn't slay him. Hector took the place of Paris and Achilles  on the side of the Greeks. Hector got killed and Achilles dragged his body and let it fed by dogs. Paris  strong by now  revenged for his brother's death. He shot Achilles on his most vulnerable part  his heel. Achilles got killed. This time  the Greeks almost \""gave up\"" and sailed back to an island just near Troy. They left a giant wooden horse outside the city of Troy. Sinon  who was so deceitful  said it was an offering to Athena and that they should get it inside the city. So they did. During the night  Trojans partied as if there was no end. This time  the Greeks were about to sack the city. So it happened. The Trojans' defense fell and Troy got devastated. The characters of Helen of Troy are easy to understand because they acted according to the original text. I would rate it as four because as for me  the movie is a must see. Of course  it's not only about the looks of the actors and actresses but also their enthusiasm in portraying such roles in the movie. I can say that the characters are well fitted for their roles. The movie Helen of Troy was a good movie because it touched my heart. The one who had a good performance was Princess Cassandra as she tells all her prophecies. The love of Paris for Helen is appealing because even though he knew the consequences of taking Helen away from Sparta  he still didn't let go of Helen and stood up for the consequences. King Priam also had a good performance in the movie. It showed his being family-oriented; that he defended his family amidst of all the difficulties. Another thing was the lust of Agamemnon to Troy. The war being led by him just went on for nothing because yeah  he got it all but is he happy? He had the internal conflict within himself because he's mad at himself why he had to sacrifice Iphigenia  his daughter.\tLast week  our class watched the movie Helen of Troy. The first thing that I noticed was it was a long movie (175 minutes). Helen of Troy was released in the year 2003  bringing to life the famous Greek poem The Iliad written by Homer. It was produced by Ted Kurdyla and was directed by John Kent Harrison. This adventurous/tragic epic showed the story of the battle between the Greeks and the Trojans. It depicted the complexity of the events and characters in the story. One of the visible aspects shown in the movie was the difference of the relationship of Agamemnon and Menelaus between that of Hector's and Paris'. Agamemnon's and Menelaus' relationship was more like that of a leader-servant. Agamemnon being the commanding older brother while Menelaus being the submissive one. On the other hand  Hector's and Paris' was more of the brotherly type. They respected each other and even if they didn't often show it they worried for the other's welfare. The distinction of the two relationships was clearly seen in the fight between Menelaus and Paris. Agamemnon didn't care if his brother would be killed unlike Hector who even sacrificed his life for the sake of Paris. For Agamemnon  he valued his life more than his brother's while for Hector he valued his brother's life more than his own.All in all  the movie was an effective adaptation of the poem. The crew used elements that are similar to the period when the story was made. They have shown successfully the idea of what it would be like during those times. Also  the actors were perfect for their roles. They evoked different feelings such as anger  irritation and empathy from their audience \u0096 a clear sign that they did a good job. They also did a good job in editing and directing the movie  only the important events were included. The only negative aspect of the movie that I saw was the incomplete portrayal of some of the characters like Achilles. All things considered  my final rating for the movie is 4.\tHelen of Troy  made in 2003  was a movie by John Kent Harrison who also directed the Hallmark novel-turned-into-mini-series A Wrinkle In Time. It was also produced by Ted Kurdyla  unit production manager of Phone Booth (2002). The movie runtime was 175 minutes. Our class viewed it from July 28  2005 until August 2  2005 in forty minute sessions.The movie was an adaptation of The Iliad by Greek poet  Homer. Helen  daughter of Leda and Zeus  was the acclaimed face that launched a thousand ships. She was married to Spartan King  Menelaus but ran away with the enemy  the Trojan prince  Paris. Menelaus intended to get her back but his brother  Agamemnon  had bigger plans. The ulterior motive of the war was Troy  in actuality. The movie showed  using Pollux's words  \""the madness that lies in men.\"" Women  power  wealth and glory\u0085 these were the actual causes of the war. In the course of watching the movie  my inclinations were varying. I didn't appreciate the inconsistencies. For example  the gods  who were the driving force of the war  was not shown. Paris  in the text  was cowardly but in the movie  he was this valiant prince who was a better warrior than Hector. Ridiculous! Menelaus was not portrayed as the atrocious warrior that he should have been but more of a love-struck teenager. Achilles lacked the depth. He acted more like a WWF wrestler rather than a man of divine heritage. Another disappointment was the complete disregard for King Priam begging Achilles for the return of his son's  Hector  cadaver. It was a moving scene but it was completely wasted away by Helen of Troy. Though  Rufus Sewell was a very effective Agamemnon  in my opinion. He was portrayed as the savage warrior who would do anything  even kill his own progeny  for the sake of glory. I also have to give kudos to Helen of Troy shining light to the other characters such as Cassandra  Menelaus and Agamemnon.In general  the actors were inconsistent  ineffective and forgettable with the exception of Sewell. They lacked the depth and substance. The effects were low budget but understandable considering it's a TV-movie unlike the Hollywood film  Troy (2004). Sound effects were nothing special. The cinematography was cheesy especially during the fight scenes but was great during the sacrifice of Iphigenia. Altogether  I would give the film 2 out of 5.\tHelen of Troy: Helen's Greed Helen of Troy is a film that covers the story of Homer's Iliad. Directed by J.K. Harrison  written by Ronni Kern and produced by Adam Shapiro c/o the Universal Television Studio  it was released in 2003 on US television as a mini series. My classmates and I  however  watched it on DVD (from Universal Home Video) last week (July 25 \u0096 August 5  2005) during our English classes. The whole film is 175 minutes long. It was about the fate of Helen  Zeus's bastard  who was the root of the Trojan War and the Fall of Troy. The film started with a childish feud between the goddesses Aphrodite  Hera and Athena who were fighting over Eris' Golden Apple of Discord that was marked For the Fairest. Zeus advised them to go to the Trojan Paris who was said to have a remarkable taste for beauty. Weak Paris chose Aphrodite who promised love  passion and Helen \u0096 the fairest woman on earth \u0096 over Hera's gift of wealth  and Athena's gift of victory. Paris  whose kingdom was faced with a conflict with the Greeks  had to sail to Sparta to make peace with the king  Menelaus. Instead of making peace  Paris triggered the conflict by bringing Helen to Troy making the Greeks think that their queen was abducted. This angered the Greeks and then the Trojan War began. Greeks won the ten-year war and Helen was reclaimed. Troy was destroyed and Helen was back  all right  but many innocent lives were wasted. The war would have ended peacefully if Helen surrendered to the Greek Commander-in-Chief  Agamemnon. In the film  she gave herself up but didn't surrender. Note the words of Paris' psycho-psychic half sister Cassandra to Helen  \""You gave yourself up but you didn't surrender  did you?!\"". Helen didn't surrender because she didn't yield to the Greeks or even abandoned her love for Paris. What she did was definitely unacceptable for Agamemnon. Helen's greed failed to save Troy.Beyond the fact that the story was well written  the direction was laudable. The director was able to pull out from every actor the right emotion that each needed to play. Actor Rufus Sewell who played the evil and lustful Agamemnon acted so well that he was able to make everyone in our class despise him. The use of computer-generated graphics (CG) on the Greek vessels was a wise move. It helped the filmmakers save money and time in creating the film. Although I believe that there is more to computer effects  the use of CG was not that bad. The sound effects wasn't that bad either. Overall  I give the movie 3.75 stars out of five. It's not a movie that I will eagerly watch but it's good enough to see compared with other movies about the Iliad especially when you're after a more accurate account of the Greek epic.\tIn connection with mythology  our class was given the opportunity to view the film  Helen of Troy  last July 26 to August 2  2005. Helen of Troy  released during the year 2003  is a movie produced by Ted Kurdyla and directed by John Kent Harrison. It was based on Homer's \""Iliad\"" and its primary focus is \""The Trojan War\""  which is one of the greatest stories in Ancient Literature. The film involves the story of Helen  the most beautiful woman in the world  being married to Menelaus in a land called Sparta. When Prince Paris comes to seek peace with Sparta  Helen falls madly in love with him and follows him to Troy. Enraged  Menelaus calls upon the Greek army to fulfill the oath they once swore: to defy anyone who stole Helen. From thus  the battle for Helen's love was started  putting the lives of many great warriors at stake. Although  the story presented a different plot from the text  people who haven't read it would be able to grasp the main idea from the movie. I was disappointed by the way the writers portrayed the character of Achilles  especially his line: \""I stand before High King Agamemnon\"". Achilles was not under anyone  not even the highest of Kings; he cared for his own skin and fought for his own glory. Making him faithful to Agamemnon and responsible for no one else was a mistake because it means to show there were no other people involved who concerned Achilles. I also did not like the reason the writers made for Achilles killing Hector. According to the text  Achilles kills Hector to avenge his best friend's death \u0096 not to save Agamemnon. Another significant difference was Helen begging for the body of Hector from Agamemnon  which was wrong; I believe it's important that Priam  Hector's father  was the one who asked for his son's body from Achilles because it shows that despite all the people Achilles has killed  there was still compassion left in the heart of even the most ruthless warrior. What worked particularly well for the film was the focus on Helen's royal family; it explained a lot about Helen's background  thus giving the audience more information than in the text.I give this movie  a final rating of 4. The setting  effects and the cinematography was great. It made me feel as if it's the exact place where the battle happened. Helen of Troy is a movie that immediately captures its audience  engraving into their hearts the message it wishes to impart  which is: there will always be people who are ready to fight  whether it be for love of country  love of glory  or simply loving someone.\t\""It doesn't matter who my Father was; It matters who I remember He was\"" (Anne S.) Helen of Troy is mainly a tragic movie tinted with romance  which was released in 2003. Adam Shapiro produced a 175-minute movie  which I eagerly watched in the last week of July. The most famous author of this Greek mythological story is Homer. The movie is taken from Homer's epic  \""The Iliad\"" and this specific part is about a ten year war that was fought by both men and gods  between the Greeks and the Trojans because of the most beautiful woman in the world  Helen. The movie starts in Sparta  Helen's homeland  and already  lust is in the atmosphere as seen in most male characters but most especially  in Agamemnon  Helen's brother-in-law and the High King of Mycenae. He was portrayed to be the worst villain in the movie because not only did he kill his daughter  Iphigenia  to sail to Troy  bully his little brother Menelaus and cheat but he also coveted and raped Helen in front of Menelaus  the loving husband. Thus  a lot of viewers think that Agamemnon is as evil as can be but I dare to disagree. Even though Agamemnon killed his daughter to pursue his ambition  it could not be denied that he cared for his daughter. The only time you see him sincerely smile is when he played with his daughter  when he spent time with her in the garden. Also  before killing her  he needed a moment to think and didn't immediately say yes to the gods' demand. Then after he killed his daughter  you see him shaken and unstable for a moment. He also got hurt. Later in the movie  during his conversation with Helen  you can see that in his stone heart  there is still a soft spot for his daughter Iphigenia. Other than a mad man  he was also a father in whom his daughter would feel such happiness and safety in his arms. The acting  sound effects and lighting was praiseworthy although I was not particularly happy with the script because I felt that the romantic scenes were forced into a very tragic movie. In the end  I really enjoyed the movie  especially the fight scenes and because it made you think. I would rate this movie a nine. I firmly believe it's worth watching!\tThe film followed the Iliad's basic storyline and even included the gods  albeit briefly. There was  however  had an extremely important difference: it was told through the eyes of a lover not a fighter and this altered things so much. A lot of the characters underwent changes in order to support the themes of love  pride and desire  the three great emotions that burn within the hearts of men. A great example would be Paris  a cowardly pretty boy in the Iliad but a noble prince in the film for the obvious reason that it would not look good if a queen ran away with a wimp. Speaking of women  it was pleasing to note that the women in the film were given bigger roles and larger prides  especially that of Helen's. However  while glory and honor were there  they were overshadowed by the desires  which was really annoying. Achilles  the greatest hero of the Greeks  was demoted to a battle-happy ruffian. In fact all the Greeks were portrayed as barbarians. Thankfully they left Odysseus alone. He was himself; a wise and diplomatic leader who would often be the one to calmly come up with effective solutions and with his gift of gab could keep peace. Taken as a whole  the film was quite delightful  a clear window into the culture of the ancients. The actor's portrayed their characters with vigor and enthusiasm  especially Rufus Sewell as Agamemnon  with his half-mad stare  forceful speech and disdainful stance and Emilia Fox as Cassandra with her eyes wide and strained with horror coupled with a royal's proud demeanor. The lighting and sounds intensified the moods of the scenes and complimented the actions of the characters like the foreign haunting song played during the discovery of the wooden horse added to the mystery and allure of the strange artifact. The straightforward alignment of scenes helped things run smoothly and adding the prophecy of Troy's downfall and the banishment of Paris and the abduction of Helen by Thesus was a nice touch; it gave the background of the lovers. The costumes were authentic-looking but sadly the same cannot be said of the animation of the ships. There was a lot of symbolism in the film like the birds fleeing Troy as the Greeks foreshadowing the departure of happy times arrived. The script however is debatable. On one hand it is full of witty remarks but on the other said remarks don't seem to fit well with the time frame. My final rating of this is a 3.5. It is a great film  perfect for a romantic person but for a fan of the classic tale like myself its best to see it just once and not delve in too deeply or suffer the pangs of disappointment.\tHelen of Troy was released in 2003  a made-for-television movie based on the tragic Iliad  produced by Adam Shapiro and directed by John Kent Harrison. I watched all the hundred and seventy-five minutes of the film during the latter days of July this year  and was left pondering on how the plot played on the concept of the evil of excess. This concept is introduced in the bribes of the three goddesses: wealth  glory  and love. These were the three things men wanted most and though none of these are inherently wicked  in the end we see that these destroyed the men who sought them most. Wealth was one of Agamemnon's motivations; it was for wealth that he assaulted Troy. Motivated by this desire  he sacrificed even his daughter  Iphigenia. What did this lead to? A brutal death \u0096 he was murdered in vengeance. Achilles  on the other hand  was primarily driven by the call of glory. He lived for glory and nothing was sweeter to him than triumph. Yet  to what did this bring him? To Death  as we all know  by an arrow in his heel. Then there was Paris  who was moved only by love. Love was front and center  love was Helen  and as long as Helen was his  he was alive. Nevertheless  the ten years when he had love was ten years of war  with pain and suffering all around him. He also died in the end. Thus were the evils of excess portrayed.I had many complaints about the movie  especially on the alterations in the characters of Agamemnon  Achilles  Hector  and Paris. Yet  they must be forgiven  for when I look at how the plot was developed and presented  I find that they are necessary changes. Overall  the script  cinematography  lighting  effects  directing  editing  and the acting were acceptable for a production for television  albeit unmemorable. However  if the movie was unmemorable for me  it is a matter of my taste and expectations \u0096 so I would give it six stars out of ten.\tOn the 9th of July  our class started watching the 2003 film \""Helen of Troy\"". It took us 4 meetings to finish the 175 minute-long film. Ted Kurdyla produced it with a mixture of action  adventure  drama and romance. And based it on Homer's Iliad where it focuses on the life of Helen  played by Sienna Guillory  and Paris  played Matthew Marsden.It all started in Troy  with the birth of Paris and the prophesy of Cassandra (Emilia Fox) on the fall of Troy if he lives. But Paris survives and when he grew up  he was reunited with his family. In Greece  after years of being kept by her kidnapper  Helen was retrieved by her county but was disowned by her own father  so Menelaus stepped up to claim her. Unhappily married to Menelaus  Helen went with Paris who took her from Sparta to Troy  which triggered the Trojan War that lasted for 10 years. The war ended with the Fall of Troy when a wooden horse containing the Greek soldiers was brought inside the Troy gates.The relationship of Agamemnon & Menelaus as brothers is easily differentiated with that of Hector & Paris in the film. Though Agamemnon & Menelaus have known each other since they were young  it is seen that Menelaus was degraded and looked down on by his older brother. Hector & Paris on the other hand  meeting only in the latter part of their lives  showed their brotherly love to the extent of dying for each other.In the film  the actors were able to communicate their roles to the audience that helped the audience understand the emotions of the characters better. Even the fight scenes were made very realistic. The sound effects and setting also helped give the actual feel of the movie  taking the audience to the exact time and place of the story. The only scene that didn't work for me was when the Greek ships were shown sailing towards Troy. The animation of that scene wasn't done very well making it seem unrealistic. But aside from that  every aspect of the production was effective in portraying the Iliad to the audience.I give it 4 stars out of 5!\tJohn Harrison's Helen of Troy  aired in 2003 as a three-hour TV miniseries  is one of the many attempts of modern man to relive the classic poems of Homer  which  in contrast to his tragedy The Iliad  remains indomitable and unshakable even by time itself. The movie does come close  however  to set its own mythological reference of the mystery behind the Fall of Troy as it sets the plot  characters and important scenes making it a laudable interpretation. Playing to its strength of visualizing a realistic account of the epic  the movie makes its viewers feel the poignant connection with its tragic characters and equally timeless themes. The character of Helen offers a subtle but effective disrobing of her nature and personality  more than stripping off of her garments  as events awaken her capacity to make more mature decisions and accept their corresponding consequences  a process most viewers can easily empathize with. The movie also weaves in the three ascendant desires of men as it takes shape in Agamemnon's mad obsession for greater wealth in conquering Troy  Achilles' drive for glory in battle  and Paris' and Menelaus' desire (and possibly love) for Helen. The production's technical aspect has added to the story's overall appeal to the audience  creating an entertaining progression with its cleverly written script and well-thought out plot. But as most other efforts of matching the genius of Homer's writing with the magic of technology and the brilliance of cinematic advancements  the movie still has not sailed enough ships to bring to life the grandeur of Troy. It remains an incisive interpretation with its foundation rooted only on the dusty columns that remain the only a vague remembrance of the city's lost magnificence and splendor.\tIs it REALLY worth it? - A movie review and Reactions to the MovieHelen of Troy  a 175 minute long Action/Drama movie  directed by John Kent Harrison and released in 2003  is yet another depiction of one of the greatest classic Greek Literature  The Homer's Iliad told upon the point of view of Menelaus (James Callis)  the King of Sparta and Helen's husband. The main story line revolves around a war between two nations  favored by their Gods  which was said to be because of a woman with beauty beyond human description and blessed with the name  Helen played by Sienna Guillory. Her fleeing with Paris (Mathew Marsden)  a Trojan prince  to Troy was mainly the reason why Menelaus together with his brother Agamemnon  the High King of the Aegean  and all under his rule waged war with the Nation of Troy. But of course there other reasons behind this war particularly Agamemnon's thirst power and the desire to obtain everything. It was quoted by Menelaus in the movie \""War is waged by nations  but it is human beings who pay the price. \"". It is indeed true as seen in the movie  that some point war is the result of the selfish wants of a nation's ruler and his desires to obtain them. But in reality it is not the ruler who suffers the consequences of his decisions. It's those under hid rule who does. Thousands were killed because of Menelaus' desire to get Helen back and so did Agamemnon's desire to gain more power through conquering the only nation independent from his rule. Their selfish decisions led to the flooding of Troy's streets with blood. Is it really worth it? These deaths? I think not. Men  human kind in general  as seen in the Iliad gave in to their desires more than actually thinking about the effects of their actions. Human kind are people who possessed the capability of weighing their actions. Doing so wouldn't hurt anyone. It would actually help. The movie in general  would be a 4 for me. The actors did well on their parts evoking emotions from the viewers. Although there were a contrasting depiction of some characters from the text and from the movie  such as Helen and Paris  the effect was still great. The cinematography was also excellent. It really captured the essence of the Iliad making the story line be more like the text itself. Also the use of modern cinematography as seen in the movie also gave an interesting view of the movie and how it took place in the Aegean. Over all  the movie was a very good watch  watching it again would be fantastic.\tInspired by one of the most"
Hide and Seek (2005),"I was going to give this a five like a number of other reviewers and critics seemingly did. It would have never dipped below because of the superb casting. De Niro and Fanning are phenomenal. They make each other better  rather that conflict with one another. Even Elisabeth Shue is very  very good in her small part. Amy Irving  the mom  is decent  although clearly distant  while Dylan Baker and the guy who sells De Niro's character's David the house  Steven  are both weird  creepy  and coupled with the neighbors  are like suspects in a Scooby Doo cartoon.Unfortunately  I knew the ending already because I had read the spoiler thinking I'd never see this movie. Knowing the ending still did not fix the unnerving and unbelievably chilling moments and feel of this movie. Fanning with her dark hair style like a thirteen year old  mixing with her bugged out seven year-old-like blue eyes is just freaky.At first I just thought the game was overplayed  but then I realized the therapeutic symptoms of it. David's career as a psychologist isn't really explored (in deleted scenes it is) and he doesn't seem to be working after moving his daughter. The move comes after the \suicide\"" of his wife. The cycle starts in the beginning with an apparently struggling relationship between David and his wife. You'll see what seems to be coming  but you'll also be surprised by its real meaning.The bathtub scenes in the new house are outstanding. How De Niro sleeps there after is beyond me. You walk in to your daughter's room and she's wide awake and bugged eyed  and talking about whom you've perceived as an imaginary friend. It gets worse obviously  but not as you might imagine. By the end of the movie it seems tedious and it becomes clear how it will end.The theatrical version of the movie contains the best ending by far. It's suggestive  yet clear  optimistic  yet alarmingly dark. It's fitting and creepy. Dakota Fanning's tiredness begins to make sense and it is made clearer in the deleted scenes; moreover  the backfill on this story is great. With the exception of Elizabeth Young. I didn't know the relationship between her and David had gone that far  not to mention some things didn't seem entirely congruent.De Niro may have been one of the only actors to pull this role off. He's real  passionate  and a good dad. I believe in earnest that he is trying to help his traumatized daughter. His patience is off-the-wall amazing (the psychologist in him)  yet he maintains discipline when raising his daughter. Best of all he doesn't give up hope.I'd love more than anything to break down the \""surprise ending\"" because it is when I feel De Niro is at his subtle best  and Fanning her absolutely most desperate  and it works. Famke Janssen works as Fanning's doctor. She doesn't steal any scene and is such a relaxing presence on screen. She very well-casted as a comforting doctor.You have to look past this movie as a psychological thriller  although there are unresolved issues. It is a movie about putting behind themselves (both David and Emily) a very traumatic past. That is accomplished and it was more of the point of the movie. De Niro at first looks old  but then seems to settle into his role  yet he clashes sometimes with Shue's character. But I love Shue as Elizabeth Young. This character needed to be strong  confident  yet not arrogant  while still being charismatic  and Shue brilliantly displays that. She and David work very well together. Emily on the other hand is clearly going down the path of a death obsessed woman and won't move on. All of these reasons are why the ending and the movie is quite good  and I've given it a more befitting rating.As for the whimper of the end: it's not. As aforementioned it gets tedious and redundant  but it is resolution and it is the full circle coming out of the character. Dakota Fanning is at her best here. She has rediscovered human emotion and reality. There is a lot of foreshadowing because it's a mystery movie  but most of all be prepared to be freaked out; and that is why you'll want the movie to be over.\tMr. DeNiro  Bob  my future sugar daddy  the actors of all actors  what has happened? You're still great  but I mean  this was just too average and not in your league at all.Sorry  I had to get that out. I'm very disappointed  everyone at my work told me that this was a great movie  and I wasn't that excited to tell the truth. These past few years we've released some \""big surprise twist ending\"" movies: The Sixth Sense(good movie)  The Others(pretty decent)  Signs(Alright)  and The Village(bad bad bad!). Now  not that I'm totally upset with this flick  I mean Dakota is becoming a fine actress. We have to admit  she is very talented for her age. She's very believable and cute to watch. But a lot of this movie leads up to nothing and has nothing to be excited or jumpy over. It has a story  but it wasn't delivered right. I mean  this is an A-cast: Robert DeNiro  Elizabeth Shue  and Amy Irving. I guess it just wasn't that interesting to me.If you enjoy these surprise thrillers  you probably enjoy it. But if you've seen one surprise ending thriller  you've seen them all  right? I should take my own stupid advice.6/10\tI have to confess. I began laughing at some point in the film. Not at Amy Irving's delicately dark portrayal of a woman trapped in God-knows-what misery. This odd concoction kept my interest  but  God help me  kept getting funnier and funnier. I was never invested in these characters so the suspense didn't kill me when they were in jeopardy. I was laughing and saying  \""Take them all away to the loony bin! They're all nuts!\"" Everything was laden with psychiatric geegaws  like the whole cast was from the Day Room at Psych 2! Elizabeth Shue's wardrobe  on all three separate occasions she appears  was so low-cut I'm surprised De Niro didn't offer to treat her for a breast fetish. The kid moped and was silent. There were so many dead stops where she doesn't answer questions or greetings that you wish people would just quit talking to her! Everybody was pussyfooting around treating her so gently  that I hoped somebody would scream  \""STOP IT  EMILY! SNAP OUT OF IT!\"" It isn't until the end that we realize WHY she clams up  poor devil  with her hyper-fervid eyes protruding out of her head and her penchant for morbid drawings of herself and her invisible maniac friend \""Charlie.\"" You'll enjoy this movie if you like to see a bonkers kid get tucked into bed a dozen times with identical pillow talk from three different adults who must have been raised in the same Group Nuthatch. You'll like it if you wanna play hide-and-seek and hear De Niro incessantly calling  \""Emily? Emily? Em?\"" with doors squeaking and winds ululating. It's a long  languid fright in the night  especially at 2:06 a.m.. I don't see how the De Niro Clan could go to the bathroom in that house. Nights  the bathroom door is bathed in light and critters  human and non  keep croaking in his tub. If you enjoy seeing a look of consternation embed itself on De Niro's face  this film is your baby. (Maybe he is just constipated.) He proclaims he's going to be a full-time Dad to his near-catatonic daughter and what does he do? He takes her to a strange new manse in the country  where she wanders around like a wraith while he plasters a headset on his ears and plays jazz so loudly he can't hear the kid or people knocking and walking in! He keeps fooling with a TELESCOPE  a very good one  brought from the city where  what?  he used it to track his voyeur clients? In the boonies  he uses it to observe his sorrowing neighbors. De Niro  supposedly  is a psychologist  counselor to all manner of troubled folk for many years  given his age! Have a cathartic laugh. The swarms of psychiatric personnel are inundated with their own psychoses and blind spots in this movie. That is one reason I liked it - seeing the Behavior Police overwhelm and suffer! There is a \""good\"" psychologist/colleague of De Niro's  Famke Janssen  who is so sweet  she should be canonized. She's evidently been working cheek-by-jowl with De Niro for years and has NEVER picked up anything at all strange about him. But she finds lots of neuroses in the spooky child  who is so eerie with those bulging orbs the janitor could diagnose trouble. This movie is a psychiatric hoot. The neighbor lady  Melissa Leo  is a real doll and the movie's only normal human being  and is handling the recent death of her little girl with grace. Her husband  said to be goofy with grief  appears to be just fine. To these people  De Niro shows no warmth except when he thinks to advance his crumbling perceptions in this wooded Community from Hell and goes next door to fraternize  briefly. The canny neighbor woman WISELY refuses his attempt to give them counsel. He'd certainly have brought them CLOSURE! Haha. Her instincts  unlike the saintly lady shrink's and Elizabeth \""Decollete\"" Shue's  are true! I have never seen glass and a window frame break so quickly  and catapult a woman effortlessly thru a window in the little girl's bedroom  with Bug-Eyes looking on. \""Em? Emily? Emily? Em' Em'?\"" Soggy cat  crimson bath waters  bloody printed expostulations worthy of a demented kindergartner on the tub surround  swinging metal lamps that squeak in the night  light bulbs on strings in basement a la \""Psycho\""  with empty cot at the ready - a perfect John Wayne Gacey sublet - this movie has something for everyone. But  above all  it tickled my funny bone! I loved the end  where the Wacko Arch-Villain  in that special inflatable yellow jacket  dies in the dingy  dank  dark drink of a convenient nearby cavern. The defunct Villain was kept afloat  amid a sea of mutilated baby dolls  so a great profile could be shot. The last scene of the movie foreshadows future psychiatric eruptions for the Saintly Lady Colleague to handle. It doesn't look good. But we somehow know that if this Dr. is dispatched by the \""Evil Eye\"" progeny she has chosen to mother  she WILL go to Psychiatric Heaven with Freud  Jung  De Niro (he wasn't responsible for his actions  after all) and Dr. Spock. At long last in \""Hide and Seek \"" the shrinks and psychologists are outed! This is one cathartic anti-Diagnostic & Statistical Manual movie. How about a sequel featuring that lovely neighbor lady writing a self-help book entitled  \""Baked Goods Are Better Than Half-Baked Therapies?\""\tFrom the moment this movie begins  wealthy parents  one kid  NY brownstone  Volvo station wagon..you know the rest. Anyway  Ma dies  no big giveaway there  Pa and obnoxious kid move to..you guessed it  the Cape Cod upstate. You've seen that too. So  why does someone of De Niro's age have such a young kid? And why do old actors have no problem scoring with young chicks? I watched this movie feeling all the time I wanted to get up and beat the living hell out of every small kid actor(well  I use the term loosely. This kid is ...awful  almost as bad as the cheesy Hickcockian music score (like blade cutting through the shower curtain) every time they open a closet. Inn short  comment on this site like  \""Amazing performances and atmosphere with an intelligent script\""  \""A classic underachiever\""  and \""Good Thriller  With an Excellent Very Dark Alternative End\"" can only come from you're average shut-in who who would find the Muppets scary. Flush this one down the toilet if someone gets it you for Christmas.\tDeniro needs to stay away from thrillers and stick to playing bad guys or cops. In Hide and Seek  he portrays probably the worst psychiatrist/single father I've ever seen. Okay  I won't really spoil the ending but after \""the revelation\"" of this Who's Doin It  it did NOT work for me. The writer of this movie Ari Schlossberg must have logged a lot of how-to-be-a-Hollywood screenwriter hours in class. Deniro's last thriller  Godsend  was also terrible  and he played a goofy doctor in that one  too! Typical stupid sheriff in this one who doesn't call for back-up and thinks his flashlight is a better weapon than his handgun. The daughter's role could have been played by anyone  but Dakota Fanning is the latest young darling hob-nobbing from movie to movie with big names. Her best-and only-good role as 'The Daughter' was in I Am Sam  where I thought she was fantastic. Famke Janssen was average and fluff as was Elisabeth Shue. The one and only good part of this movie is the one that didn't make it; be sure to see the alternate ending of Emily where she is institutionalized. A much smarter choice than the original ending. But then  making this movie at all was not a smart choice anyway.\tI just saw this movie last night  and I am totally confused. Did DeNiro kill his wife because he caught her cheating or did she commit suicide? If he did kill his wife because she was cheating  am I to believe he developed a split personality disorder because of the \""trauma\"". Or did he just go \""crazy\"" because he found her dead? Regardless  the ending still stunk up the room. The whole time I thought just about everybody was part of DeNiro's multiple personality disorder. I figured Charlie(one of the multiple personalities) was the guy making all the bad things happen because DeNiro was a Vietnam vet having post traumatic stress and that \""Charlie\"" was the Viet Cong. I thought the keys that the cop left were a symbolic way for DeNiro to start locking up the extra personalities. I thought that when some of the people (personalities) died  that was the good work of a psychiatrist ridding Deniro of the multiple personalities. I actually thought Deniro didn't have a daughter  and that she was just another personality that was trying to get him to understand that he was the one with a problem. I figured that DeNiro had actually killed his wife because of the stress of the Vietnam War  made him not see things rationally. I think my over thinking of this movie (as my fianc\u00e9e said I did) would have made a great movie with a great ending.\tHide and Seek has to be the worst movie I've had to sit through recently  It's awful  Easily the worst performance by Robert Deniro BUT  all that said  it was a good performance by Dakota Fanning  She really is a talented little young actress  she plays the creepy child role really well  she was the only plus sign  for this movie apart from the Gorgeous looks of Famke Jansen. She looked awesome.I've watched a lot of Horror's  Scary movie's  and this along with Godsend are the worst both by Deniro! I found a lot of the creepy parts really funny  they were so laughable  the things they said  they weren't scary  it was a joke  everything horror like about this movie is a LOL  i was laughing my bottom off watching it! i had to check and try to find out if it was a black comedy or not.Save yourself money  if you fancy it  Rent it.\tHide and Seek was a giant let down.I didn't enjoy this movie. The plot is full of clich\u00e9s and even \""borrows\"" elements from other movies (The Shining  Secret Window). Yes  this movie has a surprise ending but you'll be able to guess it a long time before it happens  this movie is that pathetically predictable. For an R-rated horror movie  Hide and Seek is not very violent or shocking  honestly this movie should have been rated PG-13. It's also horrible to see such great actors (Robert DeNiro  Dakota Fanning  etc.)being wasted in this movie. One more comment  the male neighbors in this movie are unnervingly creepy  most of them all make remarks about little Emily (Fanning)saying  \""She's such a beautiful little girl\""   all the while having a perverse grin on their faces. I was half-expecting one of those weirdos to offer her candy.This is a below average horror movie; don't watch it  you'd just be wasting your time.\t***This comment definitely contains spoilers!!!*** Robert de Niro's recent movie \""Hide and Seek\"" is  as another IMDb commentator stated  a \""watchable\"" movie. Although it is decently made  its failure to become a box office success was due to its script which was rather clich\u00e9. The plot line that the central character of the movie turned out to be the real villain is nothing new. Probably it was first used by Agatha Christie in her novel \""Murder of Roger Ackroyd\"" approximately eighty years ago. Even with the further twist that this central character/villain himself probably did not remember the crimes due to memory suppression  the plot line is still nothing new. Rod Serling and others used this kind of plot line decades ago. (Some readers may recall a 1963 Twilight Zone episode \""The New Exhibit\"" in which the central character played by Martin Balsam kept on killing and killing but did not remember any of his crimes due to his memory suppression. He blamed the murders on supernatural acts by his wax statues.) Because of this hackneyed plot  the so-called surprise ending of this movie was not much of a surprise. The only unexpected thing about the ending of the movie which is worth mentioning is the fact that the screenwriters steered the moviegoers to think that this movie was a horror movie in which an apparition named Charlie was behind all the horrible things occurring in the Calloway household. The screenwriters of the movie borrowed liberally from the Japanese movie \""Dark Water\"" to make the movie look like a horror movie. For example  just like in the Japanese movie \""Dark Water \"" 1) Calloway household consists of one parent and one child  2) Charlie initially revealed himself only to the child and 3) Charlie seems to be associated with water  especially to the bathtub. At the beginning of \""Hide and Seek \"" many fans of Asian horror movies and similar movies assumed this movie to be a horror movie  similar to \""Dark Water.\"" To the surprise of some of the moviegoers  the movie turned out to be a suspense movie in which none of the horrible events in the movie was supernatural. They were all the acts of the dual personality of the insane central character played by de Niro.Although de Niro did an admirable job playing the mentally ill psychologist  his acting was not good enough to save this rather clich\u00e9 script. \""Hide and Seek\"" was merely watchable  but not very unique.\tDe Niro is brilliant as usual. Hard to fault him. However it is slightly annoying that whomever wrote this screenplay owes a big chunk of homage to King. Instead of the Overlook Hotel we have a house on the lake in a very deserted part of the country. Instead of the black chef being contacted by the boy using the shining who then comes  we have the little girl phoning the Psychiatrist who comes from a distance but seems to arrive (from far away suggesting a continuity error) in a very short time (judging by the time passing in the movie). Other major similarities are when David looks at the journals he's been keeping all this time (he finds that they have never actually left the packing crates) and finds them empty - I wouldn't have been surprised if it had read \""All work and no play makes David...\"" The final chase scene is once again similar to The Shining when he reaches the room door with he knife in his hand. Finally the many flashbacks he has to a dance hall which looks not like 2004 New Year but more like something from the 1920's is more than just a bit similar to what is going on in the Overlook's Gold room (which oddly enough is also celebrating New Year!) It's The Shining with the ghosts removed. Great movie  but really why so blatantly copied from another movie?\tThis movie was depressing to both me and my husband. It left us in a bummer mood. I never thought about DeNiro being too old to be Dakota's dad  it's not unusual to see an older man with a young child. Actually nowadays it's very common with marriages/remarriages. I would rather see that matchup then the leading man being 65 and the leading lady 25 if you know what I mean. Or a sexy young woman who is a nuclear fusion/fission genius or museum curator. But Hide and Seek had the usual \""rich people fleeing life\"" twist- when an awful thing happens in your house  you must move somewhere else and start life anew. But why would you move someplace so out in the country  away from the bustling city? Seems like the kid would be even more depressed leaving all her old friends  school  life  etc. behind. Then DeNiro had the physician syndrome  \""even though I am licensed professional  I cannot help my own child.\"" Fanning was OK  but I have seen her in better roles. (and yes  I have recently seen War of the Worlds and thought she was great and believable). I can't fault the kid  she probably was taking directions from off camera. I found her constant freezing up and shuddering weird and odd. It reminded me of Wednesday Addams  but Christini Ricci did it much better and much colder years ago. I love DeNiro in his other roles  perhaps he was trying a new slant. After all  now he's doing comedy! I never want to see this again  it depressed me badly. I like to see a movie for entertainment  not a black cloud feeling. Sorry  but this is the best I can do. I do try to write a fair review and like DeNiro/Fanning in other roles. Love the IMDb  it gives great background on movies and opinions.\tIt really is sad when an eleven year old child is a better actor or actress in a film than anyone else in it  especially when Robert DeNiro is part of that very small list. However  Hide & Seek is one of those films. It is difficult to believe that an actress that young (probably ten when this movie was made) can act with such superiority  but unless the film was a documented reality movie (which don't worry  I don't really wonder whether it is or not)  that is the case.A young girl (Dakota Fanning) loses her mother to a suicide incident and is never the same again. She misses her mother with passion  and all of the happiness and life she once had is drained from her. She therefore creates an imaginary friend named Charlie  which is all well and good  up until Charlie starts committing heinous acts against her father (DeNiro).The movie is very fast paced and it leads to a nearly fatal ending that you will never forget. The twist is not predictable  and you will never be able to pick up on it during the movie  unless you're very observant (there are some subtle hints throughout the movie).The ending is what makes this movie. I love movies that kick me in the balls at the end  and I have seen a countless number of movies like that (The Others  Secret Window  and Vanilla Sky as some examples)  and I have yet to be able to see it coming beforehand. 8/10!\tI wasn't impressed with 'Hide and Seek.' If you've seen Secret Window or any of the recent horror=thrillers with endings of an identical twist  you'll understand how tired and utterly formulaic this has become. Hide and Seek lacks imagination anyways because the viewer is asked to be confounded by a series of disconnected scare tactics such as things jumping of closets  the last minute awareness of the culprit before the death of an unsuspecting victim  and above all  modern horror-thriller filmmakers determined to creep you out with some weirdo kid.All the while  however  the story is very thin: that of a father and his young daughter coping with the gruesome death of the wife/mother who supposedly slit her wrists in the bathtub where she bled to death. However  we are led to believe that in fact  her death was no accident. And the weird little girl and her mysterious  elusive friend \""Charlie \"" seem to be behind the whole thing as they taunt the father who just seems to want to get on with things. Something like 'The Omen ' if you will. But  it doesn't end that way  of course.Instead  a cast of pretty good actors star in a film of cheap tricks and an even cheaper ending (including the infamous last scene where you think that all is well until there is some last minute evidence that in fact  the evil will continue unabated). Formula one hundred percent. If you've seen films like 'Secret Window' or 'Taking Lives' or other similar pseudo-mind benders (sorry  other titles don't come to mind at the moment)  then you're in for nothing new if you watch 'Hide and Seek.' In any event  De Niro didn't over act and Dakota Fanning did a fine job creeping me out.\ti've seen the movie. and it was cool at first. but it has a unusual twist to it that really sucks.i thought there was a Ghost or something stinking up the place. but it was the twist itself that did it.if you haven'd seen it.Don't!!!!!!! it sucks.there are no good worst to be found for this movie. except that is suck. and it needs to be burned. and the director & script writter(s) should be fired and thrown in prison. for movie abuse :)if you really want to see a good quality scary movie. watch \""The Grude\""it rocks..that's all i could say about it :)\tI beg to differ with the above review. I don't know squat about the director  but I really enjoyed this movie. I thought that Charlie was a ghost that was possessing Emily. If the theatrical ending doesn't do it for you  then get the DVD. It has four different endings. It comes up as four separate movies  but I don't know if only the endings are different or if the movies are different as well. I'm guessing that only the ending are different. The DVD only has just the different endings under the \""Special Features\"" area of the DVD. I just hope that if you are reading these comments that you have already seen the movie.Movies are a lot like this phrase: \""One person's trash is another is another person's treasure.\""Peter\tDiffently worth renting. I'm not sure that the movie would be any scarier if it was seen in theaters  since the whole movie builds you up with tones of anticipation  so you basically scare yourself. I guess that counts too though. As Alfred Hitchcock said  \""There's no terror in the bang  only in the anticipation of it.\""Robert DeNiro was amazing and acted very well side-by-side Dakota Fanning  who was quite good at playing this role as well.As much as I liked this movie and definitely think it's worth watching  I thought the original ending was a bit dragged out. (Great twist  though).\tAlthough many are the references to 'The Shining' and the most recent 'Secret Window' this film has definitely succeeded in creating pure terror and suspense. If you do not want to make too many comparisons with the former masterpiece by Kubrick you can still enjoy two hours of a well narrated story. Dakota Fanning is a little genius and De Niro definitely one of the best actors in different roles. His acting in this movie is genial. Although it is very well directed  the films lacks originality . It is a perfect combination of deja-vu formulas but at least it lacks the banality of most horror movies nowadays. Not many special effects but pure psychological terror.\tI rented this last night  despite the bad reviews. I just wanted to check Dakota Fanning's performance  after being impressed by her in Taken  Man on Fire and of course War of the Worlds. Well she is the best thing in Hide & Seek. De Niro is on autopilot  in a part that doesn't really challenge him. The story is interesting and creepy at first  but unfortunately that doesn't last... The twist is just so lame that it ruins the rest of the movie. It ends up being something you've seen a thousand times before. The last reel is so full of clich\u00e9s  all you can do is roll your eyes in disgust. On a separate note  it was nice to see Amy Irving (if only for a few minutes). She should be seen more often!\t...the poor reviews that some have written here are just more proof that movie audiences are getting dumber.....want only fast action and special effects. Nothing \""tedious\"" here....just a slow unfolding of a highly suspenseful story that builds to an exciting climax. It's one to view twice....as many of us do with...say..Agatha Christie mysteries after one is aware of the whole story  and to look for the little hints here and there and see if the plot is consistent.it is.as for those who complained because the trailer gave away too much....why in the world are you looking at it. My wife and i put plugs in our ears while trailers are on for just that reason.\tI just watched this movie last night with all my friends  a group of people who some love scary movies and others hate them. Everyone of my friends including myself thought this movie was really good! It had a good story  it was thrilling  shocking and kept you guessing till the very end  and still keeps you guessing. The acting as well as the story was awesome. I love scary movies and I really enjoyed this movie  in my opinion it wasn't that scary but still gives you some chills and yelps every now and then. Even thought I wasn't scared  I was still hooked in by the plot and trying to solve the mystery. I suggest seeing this movie even if you are scared of scary movies  it's a good one to see!!"""
Hostage (2005),"Bruce Willis plays Jeff Talley  a police hostage negotiator who gives it up when he blames himself for failing to prevent a tragedy. He changes careers to a cop on a small town force. Wouldn't you know it. A new hostage situation occurs and Bruce finds himself in the middle of it. Ben Foster plays Mars Krupcheck - what kind of silly name is that for a real psycho? - in an over the top performance as one of the nutty hostage takers. His partners in crime are two brothers who are totally collegiate by comparison. The three of them take a father  his son and buxom teenage daughter hostage. Young Jimmy  the son  turns out to be quite a resourceful little fellow and helps Bruce by way of a cell phone. Mars  who gets nuttier by the frame  lusts after the buxom teenage daughter while the brothers argue between themselves. The plot twists along the way keep you guessing and there's plenty of gunfire and explosions to keep you awake.\tIn this movie Bruce can't save them all. Maybe it's the age or he is upset for letting the Titanic sink - he surely would have saved it if he'd just accepted to play Leo's role :)Well  enough Bruce Willis bashing. This movie is actually good. It is like a cross between several of his movies  a mutant bred from Die Hard and Color of Night. You will also notice Ben Foster  playing a great role as the psychotic kid. You might remember him from Six Feet Under. I think he has a nice career in front of him if the darn casting people have any sense.The story is a bit overdone. I mean  we are used for Bruce Willis to do the impossible in almost all of his films  but in this one it felt as he was trying to get closer to reality. Well  he didn't do it. It's still too much  too big  too flashy  but overall a fun film to watch.\tI didn't see this movie in theater but I wanted too and it was too late.I coulnd't wait for it to come out on DVD so i could go rent it.The first thing that came to my mind when this movie ended was \wow what a great movie from Florent Emilio Siri (the directer). He did a very good job directing one of a kind movie.Robert Crais the one who wrote this novel is very smart for think of something like this it is terrific.The script is brilliant and i havant seen a movie like this in a long time.Plus I havant see Bruce Willis (Jeff Talley) like this in a long time too.All the actors in this movie were just wonderful and all the characters were well designed.If anyone who didn't see this movie should go rent it because it is very interesting and worth taken a look.\tGripping  spellbinding  and breathtaking are a few of the adjectives I use to describe this film. Definitely worth twice the price I paid to view it. As a lover of action flicks and psychological thrillers  this one is a wonderful example of both. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes to have their blood pumping and experience hyperventilation as side effects in their movie viewing.At first  I thought this was going to be all hype. It started off a little slow  but I should have realized that was only temporary. Once the Chief's coffee break was over  the movie took off like a rocket and stayed on full burners until the last 15 seconds. I can't wait to see what Mr. Willis has for us the next time out  because he is definitely getting better with age  experience and creative control.\tI just can't believe all the positive comments I'm reading about this movie! I can only assume they were written my members of the cast's families (and immediate ones at that).Bruce was Bruce  same old same old. He was no better or worse than he is in other movies. He had as much depth to his acting abilities as Sly Stallone did in Cliffhanger. None of the acting was that good  maybe with the exception of the guy who played the Smith father and he was unconscious for most of it. And the one who played March  Mars  Marshall or whatever his name was  was positively dire.There was absolutely nothing original  or for that matter interesting  about the plot. You didn't really care about any of the characters. I kept thinking through the whole house burning scene ''I hope they manage to save the fish'' In fact I almost turned the TV off about 20 minutes before the end....don't know why I didn't.Don't get me wrong  it wasn't really  really awful  it was just an average B movie....and I want the last two hours of my life back please!\tNever lie  cheat  or steal. Always strike a fair deal\u0085 The lesson that 3 troublemaking teenagers should've learned before messing with the rich and powerful authority of Mr. Walter Smith. A chase with his rich daughter in a car that they especially wanted turned into a war in a mansion of a house with professional criminals and a cop with his family on the line. This movie shows what kind of terror that three greedy amateurs can create.The professional criminals want a DVD that is located inside the building  but don't want anyone entering/exiting the house. The only person who knows where it is is unconscious  in the house. If they don't get that DVD  Jeff Talley  chief of Police's family will die. Everyone is tangled in a heavy situation  as well as the brother and sister  taken hostage inside.\""Hostage \"" I have to say is a very well directed movie and I do recommend it to those in search for a good thriller. I must add that this Drama/Suspense is over the top on Violence and Profanity. However  I think it makes the movie a whole lot more intense and breathtaking. With superb acting from all the main actors and a twist that will leave you thinking  Hostage should not be missed. 9/10\tIt's on of those movies that can makes u feel scared  sad...Has a really good scenario and idea. Also -Bruce Wilis is there as a policeman so this is a sure fact for a good movie as usual.In the beginning starts with the presentation of the Bruce Wilis job - to convince a man to not kill his wife and child  but finally they are dead because he try to save everybody but the sniper guys can't shot in the way to save and the mother and the boy.There was a great scene with the dead boy with his mouth full of blood...read nice made!Oh  another impressing thing in the movie was that the doter of the rich man was surprising not pretty actress and generally there wasn't much beauty in the movie   i mean in the face of actors (except Bruce Wilis of course:))The house of the rich family is was cool...i watched the movie with few people and everybody was saying \""wow  i want a house like this\"" I gave a point 10 but if there was 11 or up I'm giving it!!\tthis one was really difficult to rate  i love this movie  and have loved it from the first time that I watched it in theaters  once again I must say that i am very pleased with bruce Willies performance well done as usual. i must say when i boyfriend told me we were going to see this movie was wasn't to thrilled  because i had never seen it advertised  and the name just wasn't at all appealing to me  so i forced myself to go in and watch the movie  and after the movie got started i was at the edge of my seat  and was very much in to the movie  i'm glad that I went and seen this. All I have to say is don't judge the movie by its title. Its an outstanding movie\tI went with my other half to see this movie one night because we just wanted to get out of the house. Usually in these instances the movie theater is a refuge  usually. I love Bruce Willis  don't get me wrong  he is certainly on my list of favorites  but I was embarrassed for being one of his fans after seeing this movie. Not only was the plot stupid and completely non-existent  but it was painful to watch. Personally  I thought it was the icing on the cake of badness that the little boy in the story somehow knew what to do in situations of being held hostage  if so he probably would have been smarter than me and not seen the film. The only way I would ever see this movie again would be Clockwork Orange style.\tI first heard of the movie from my acting coach who gave it a thumbs up. So that Saturday night I rented it. Form the moment I put the DVD in an hit play till the credits I could not look away from the screen. The film just blew me away! The action  the performances  and the plot twists kept me at the edge of my seat begging for more.The story begins with Jeff Tally (Bruce Willis) as a hostage negotiator in Los Angeles the mission fails and a young boy dies. A traumatized Talley moves his wife and daughter to the small 'low crime' town of Bristo Camino. On one the typical quiet days three boys run into a rich teenager and fallow her home planning on stealing her Father's cars. Little do they know he does some questionable business. One thing leads to another and Jeff Talley is forced to take control of the situation before his family is murdered by the criminals who need the rich Father's information.The director who's work I haven't had the privilege of seeing successfully created a perfectly enjoyable movie any movie fan would love. That and the skill each and every actor showed helped make this movie one of the best I've ever seen. So if you get a chance rent it you won't be sorry.\t'Hostage' belongs to a genre in itself - the-Bruce-Willis-action-movie  and is a good one in the series. If you like the genre  you will enjoy this film. Otherwise  it's just another action movie.The subject tries to be a little more than the usual hostage drama that the title may indicate. It is a hostage story within a hostage story  as Willis  police chief and master hostage negotiator becomes himself a victim of extortion during a hostage taking situation. Willis developed a character of compassionate cop  usually troubled family man  pushed into violence against his will  but when he is in  violence it is! He is acting well in this role  the problem is that I lost count how many times he played it in the last ten years. Otherwise director Florent Emilio Siri whose only other directing piece in the US is in computer games does a good job despite the quite routine material he has to work with.\tHaving really enjoyed the book by Robert Crais  I was really looking forward to this film. Overall  it was disappointing and I felt the story line deviated from the book for no apparent reason and it was much the worse for it.The film starts in a great way (although early deviations from the book's superior story don't bode well) but soon it becomes completely disjointed and difficult to fathom out why things happen as they do. The ending is particularly weak and unbelievable which is a shame as (sorry to go on about this) the book's ending is very good.The highlights? Bruce Willis is superb and his acting is outstanding. A number of times his emotions really come through which is unusual. Without him  the film wouldn't be anything.\tIt's hard to go into Hostage expecting anything other than just an entertaining thrill ride  and that's all I went into the movie expecting. To my surprise  however  the movie managed to fall massively short of my low expectations. I really don't know what went wrong  as films like this tend to make themselves. The central plot of a hostage negotiator  turned police chief  having to go back to hostage negotiating after a family is held captive by a bunch of thugs is neither original or particularly clever  but if done with enough pastiche and imagination; it could  and has  lead to great thrillers. There's very little imagination here  though  and instead we've been given a thick layer of melodrama and more sentiment than the average family drama. The music  the acting  the way that the plot plays out and the script all contribute to making this film feel more like an opera than a thriller  with all the characters wearing their emotions on their sleeves and overacting to the point of sheer annoyance. I've never been in a hostage situation before  but if I was - I'm pretty damned sure I wouldn't be dripping with sentimentality! All this sentiment and melodrama is the film's downfall  as it makes it very hard to take seriously. More downfalls include a convoluted plot  a very irritating kid and Bruce Willis. I actually quite like Bruce Willis  but his performance here is under-wrought and it looks very much like he couldn't really be bothered. I don't blame him - with that script  I couldn't be bothered either; but if he'd put his back into it a bit more  the film might have ended up good instead of rubbish. Director Florent Emilio Siri seemed to want the film to straddle the line between film noir and comic book  as the opening credits suggest  but he achieves neither. The action is very over the top  and that could be compared to the action in a comic book  but it's not a comparison that holds any weight as it's just not exciting  and when you've got characters slow motion walking through a petrol bombed house  it's pretty clear that you're watching a very silly film. The producers might have thought that Willis as a draw would be enough to make this film decent - but it wasn't. Willis has made a lot of bad films over his career - and this is one of them.\tA burned-out hostage negotiator  who on his last assignment saw a child and his mother die at the hands of their captor  resigns and becomes sheriff of an upscale suburb in California. Where  of course  the tranquility is disturbed by (wait for it) ... a hostage situation.Bruce Willis is the negotiator  and that's about all you need to know about this sorry film  which manages to toss hardly any curveballs the viewer's way. You can easily imagine Willis' Jeff Talley muttering under his breath  \""Just when I thought I was out  they pull me back in.\"" Can the state cops handle the case? Naw  it has to be Talley and his crack band of Keystone Kops.Young ne'er-do-wells Mars  Dennis  and Kevin have followed the Smith family home to their seemingly impenetrable fortress. They plan to steal the family's SUV for a joyride  but then Things Happen  and patriarch Walter (Kevin Pollak) is smacked around. Tensions rise  and Talley hands control over to the staties. Oh  but then he's pulled back in  owing to a story contrivance meant to advance the plot and keep Bruce Willis on screen at all times.And that's a pretty good idea  all things considered. The kids in the movie are below atrocious; it's really as if there was a general casting call for child actors who'd never acted before - and then the worst of that lot was selected. When we're supposed to feel pathos for the captive son and daughter of Walter Smith  we instead feel scorn. Heck  let them get killed  if it'll end the movie that much more quickly.The direction is particularly ham handed  with zero finesse applied. Points are hammered home with the subtlety of a Gallagher performance. Everything's in black and white  from the characters to the decisions each makes. Come to think of it  the movie might have been improved had it been shot in black and white.Willis is the saving grace  the only reason this mess didn't rate any lower than it did. He's playing a retired John McClane  for the most part. In fact  they really should have just changed his character's name and former vocation and titled this Die Hard with a Pension Plan.\tFrench director  Florent Emilio Siri's emergence to the Hollywood screen is a great one. THis thriller is the story of a hostage taker who messes up on the job and loses a young hostage. Haunted by this event  he moves to a small city where he think there will be less crime than his former LAPD district. Little does he know that he can't run away from these kind of situations  its in his job description. Willis shines in the role as Jeff Talley  one of his better performances  i actually sympathized with his character which i usually don't. The rest of the cast was good as well  Pollak was great as the father of a family being taken hostage  while Ben Foster and Jonathan Tucker are also great as two hot-head young criminals. This film is well-written  has some great plot  and is not predictable like most thrillers. It keeps on the edge of your seat. I definitely recommend this to any fan of suspense and thriller type cop films  if you liked The Negotiator (which was better)  then you will like this too. 9/10\tWe've all seen movies such as \""Hostage\"" played out time and time and time again......A cop with a traumatic experience from his past has settled down and taken on less responsibility  only now to find himself in another tense situation that not only endangers the life of more innocent victims  but also his family's lives as well.Of course  the events now occurring force the cop to relive and work through those old painful memories.....giving our title character (Bruce Willis) one more chance to do right whereas he failed so miserably before.If you haven't seen \""Hostage\"" and you have read this far  you can pretty much guess how it all wraps up .....Formulaic and generic to say the least  \""Hostage\"" is a somewhat entertaining movie of recycled bits that have been made and remade time and time again.Although it's hardly original  \""Hostage\"" isn't necessarily boring  and it does prove itself to be watchable.However  this reviewer felt somewhat of a hostage himself  mentally pleading with my DVD player to \""LET ME GO\"" about halfway into the films run.Redundant and cyclical  \""Hostage\"" is only worth a viewing if you have nothing new or better to do for 2hrs out of your day.\tExcellent drama that literally keeps you on the edge of your seat. I am not really a great fan of Bruce Willis but did greatly enjoy his Carey Grant style of humor in his TV Series< His dramatic action in this movie is great.The son in this is a great little actor. He definitely has a future in the movie industry. The action is there... all that you would need for this type of movie. I hated that they had to set fire to that fantastic house. (Oops better check the box that this might be a spoiler!) I would love to know where it was located. Also the Canyon Lodge a seemingly burned out road house.The Mars character was the most frightening and realistic. His anger and intensity played well for the cameras. This is the Johnny Depp of the future. The other two Kelly boys that played the brothers who were in on the attempted heist of the car were also excellent. Over all this is a great movie to add to your DVD collection. I saw it on Pay per View and will definitely buy a copy for my library.\tThis movie  which is essentially a Bruce Willis vehicle was fine as action movies go. It had gunfights  and blood  and fire. Plenty of fire. However  I must admit to being tired of this format. Here comes the spoiler: So his family gets kidnapped by the badder guys and he has nowhere to turn. So he needs to take care of the Smith family  and rescue his own.I guess I'm just tired of this one man vs. all evil concept. In real life  this guy would have used his FBI contacts made during his time in L.A. to help his family. He would have let the Sheriff Captain in on it  and they could have worked together. But in Hollywood  no one works together  except in cop buddy films. It just becomes to predictable after a while  and gets old. Not to mention that Bruce is getting old. This is just my .02  but I'd like to see a scenario where the hero plays it straight and uses his friends and contacts to help him. I guess that wouldn't make much of an action film though  huh?\tJeff Talley(Bruce Willis cool and collected for as long as possible) once an ace hostage negotiator for LAPD S.W.A.T. is now a chief of police in a small rural California town. He thinks he has left behind the violence squalor and bloodshed of the big city but of course he learns one day he is wrong. A trio of angry violent disaffected teens go to a rich classmate's home in the hills and end up taking hostages as they try to shake down classmate's dad(Kevin Pollak) who happens to be an accountant with less-than-savory dealings. The home just happens to be in Chief Talley's jurisdiction and when one of his officers goes to check the scene things become progressively worse.Director Florent Siri making what I'm presuming is his American feature debut seems to relish the idea of filming an action movie in limited space(i.e.dens offices garages ceiling ducts etc.)and as such it seems to add a level of tension that might not be found in your run-of-the-mill crime/action dramas. Some of the plot lines of the movie seem to be left to dangle near movie's end(and I'm NOT saying what THOSE are)and the violence sometimes seems to be almost a little TOO artsy. I'd say that if one would argue that this movie seemed to be rife with contrivances they might have a beef here. But it is still a quite satisfying film that keeps an intriguing effective story and action lean and mean. 8 out of 10 stars.\tJeff Talley (Bruce Willis) still blames himself for a hostage-situation which went terribly wrong while he was acting as hostage negotiator in L.A. Now  small-town police chief Talley has to face a new hostage crisis which threatens to hit too close to home.'Hostage' is a stunner. '24' quality suspense  nicely-shot with good performances  particularly from the always-likable Willis who does a good job with an action hero who's in an interesting dramatic situation. The other stand-out is Ben Forster  who you may know as Russell from Six Feet Under  and  considering this performance  you'll probably soon know from many other things. His face is perfect for his part  he looks great on screen  and his eyes and expressions are particularly memorable in his interesting part.But mostly  'Hostage' is well-written by Bruce's Die Hard 2 screenwriter Doug Richardson  well-structured and paced with enthralling dramatic situations thanks to the novel by Robert Crais.And it is great to see Bruce Willis again!"""
Hotel Rwanda (2004),"Not a bad movie  but you know  I didn't really feel much for the characters in this film. While the story is reasonably compelling  you see the leads sipping wine by candle light after all the tension occurs and they're left in the hotel to manage the chaos. I mean  come on. What's that all about? Way too Hollywood to actually produce compassion for the true story at hand. Everyone seems to go nuts over this film  both at IMDb and other sites (such as rental)  and it's yet another film I feel is overrated by at least 2 out of 10 stars. I gave it a 6. It doesn't suck  but it's not all that great either. I didn't find the acting all that supreme to be honest  and while the story was important to be told  it wasn't told in a way that provides one with feeling for the actors or whom they''re portraying. I didn't feel as sorry for the characters as I did in many other movies  such as Salvador  The Killing Fields  etc. They were far better films  in my humble opinion. While this movie had its moments of sadness  it would often spoil the true story with these displays of 'wine by candle light'  which I found to be complete nonsense and totally unrealistic given the circumstances. Tantamount to drivel. I didn't really think the movie got going till around 50 minutes into the film. Sorry  but I'm a huge movie person and I simply can't agree with the majority here.\tWhen Terry George decided to make this film he did so in order to tell the story of one man's struggle to protect the lives of his family and of those taking refuge under the roof of the hotel he managed. The manager  Paul Russesabagina (Don Cheadle) awoke each new day to find an ever changing set of rules to follow and new rulers to appease with bribes. Paul only learns about the massacres taking place outside of the hotel through radio broadcasts  photographers  medics and UN peacekeepers. I don't believe it was crass (as it has been stated on some reviews) to focus on the story of an individual who survived the massacre as opposed to the lives of nearly a million who were murdered. I think the viewer gets the idea that a genocide is taking place  we feel it as the boundaries surrounding the hotel become breached and any semblance of protective help is being pulled out of the country. In fact  one of the most heart wrenching scenes takes place during an evacuation of all non-native people. On the bus to safety we can see every type of person on board who isn't a Tutsi. Even dogs are allowed on the bus  just not any of the Tutsi people. As the bus pulls away from the hotel  the gravity of the situation is all very clear to those left behind. And as this is the story of the incredible survival of Paul Russesabagina and those he was able to save from a certain death  his story becomes all the more remarkable.Terry George has helped to shine a light on a massacre that went largely unnoticed or ignored by millions of people. He did so by focusing the story of the movie onto one man's struggle for survival. Perhaps by making this movie he may have also helped to make us more aware of our place in the world at large  so that we may better shape any upcoming acts of genocide to occur in the future. Or perhaps we'll stay insulated in our own heads with images of celebrity  comfort and consumerism where \the tragedies of today are tomorrow's bargain matin\u00e9e\"".For those who have read the above header and think it to be crass  you would be correct  it is crass. However  that doesn't make the header any less true. I could have titled it  \""Shop Hotel Rwanda\""  but the thoughtful people from Amazon.com have already beaten me to it (look over to the right for the advertisement link). I really don't believe that Amazon.com put any malicious thought into the shopping link for the movie consumers that surf IMDb  the link is a completely automated provision that is supplied to every movie in its database. But you could understand that someone  perhaps most people  would be offended by it. I'm sure the header I've thought up for this movie review will offend someone  but I can't say that was my truest intention. It may be a cynical thought  but it happens to be true. What light it is seen in is entirely up to interpretation. I believe Terry George had the best of intentions  I don't believe he made his movie to be crass.The important lesson to be learned is that of learning any lesson at all. Even after watching \""Hotel Rwanda\"" and being deeply affected by it  I wonder if I'll be able to live outside of my own head. I hope we have learned  but I realize that there was a time when the world at large looked the other way while a million people were slaughtered; now they can click on a link and 'Shop Hotel Rwanda'. 9/10 Clark Richards\tI think Hotel Rwanda is better than Schindler's list.I give a 8 out of 10. Retrospecting human history genocides seem everywhere.so we need films such as Hotel Rwanda to remind us the horror  we must avoid the massacre but sadly it happens again and again.Seeing this movie I thought a lot about the massacre happened here in China during the World War 2nd the Japanese army killed about more 300 000 Chinese people but we haven't made a single big movie to reveal that history.there are lots of movies talking about the killing Jews and there is a Hotel Rwanda telling the world what happened in Rwanda but why don't we Chinese make a movie showing the world what the Japanese done to us back in the 1930s in Nanjing? About Jean Reno in the movie  he seems a bit rigid in acting I think he should be more passionate .The art direction is good.Terry did a great job.The screenplay is good too.the music is OK Jean Wycle sung the song well. anyways I am going to show my family this movie.\t\""Hotel Rwanda\"" recreates the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in the same way that \""Schindler's List\"" recreated the genocide against the Jews. The movie shows not only the massacre  but also how the international community did nothing to stop it. Hotel owner Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) and his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) sheltered several Tutsis and moderate Hutus in the Mille Collines hotel  saving them from getting murdered.Right after I saw the movie  I attended a speech by the real Paul Rusesabagina at Lewis & Clark College. He explained how the Belgian colonization of Rwanda set the stage for the 1994 genocide (the Belgians put the minority Tutsis in power  completely disenfranchising the majority Hutus)  and what it was like for him experiencing it. As for why specifically the international community did nothing to stop the massacre  Rusesabagina said (as a mild joke): \""Maybe it's because Rwanda doesn't have oil.\"" Anyway  \""Hotel Rwanda\"" is a very powerful movie that reminds us not only of this specific event  but about what can happen if we forget the past. I recommend it to everyone.\tWhen it became apparent  in 1994  that genocide was impending in the African nation of Rwanda  much of the west deemed the people of that impoverished country \""unworthy\"" of aid or resources. On the part of the United States  Rwanda was low on the list of priorities; fresh from the Bosnia conflict  and interventions in Haiti and Somalia  the US did not want to risk involvement there. A small unit of UN peacekeepers were deployed  but suffered under heavy restrictions. They were given little money and outdated equipment. When Rwandan president Habyarimana's plane was shot down in April  the dam broke and Hutu flooded the streets out for blood. The minority Tutsi were considered the enemy and were targeted by roadblocks and constant radio broadcasts calling for their extermination. Moderate Hutu also came under the blade of the machete (the preferred weapon of the masses). What started as essentially a social conflict  or what most thought a prelude to civil war  erupted into chaotic slaughter amongst a poor and uneducated populous. Bodies lay strewn in the streets  in the houses and rivers. Even before the violence reached its apex  and the term genocide became unavoidable  the world powers seemed to have forgotten Rwanda and left the country to burn.It is in the city of Kigali  during this period  that the film HOTEL RWANDA takes place. It focuses on the real life story of the manager of a five-star resort named Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle)  who has found himself integrated into the \""style\"" of the west. He procures fine cigars and expensive whiskey for his foreign visitors and for the military elite who frequent the hotel. He is a Hutu married to a Tutsi woman  Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo)  their children being of mixed blood. When the violence of April 1994 reaches his doorstep  he does everything he can to save his family  but finds himself a part of something larger. As the situation worsens  and the UN forces diminish  Paul uses his money  limited resources  and social contacts to protect the hundreds of people who sought the hotel as a refuge. He quickly realizes that there will be no intervention; the scenes involving Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte)  the frustrated UN peacekeeper  are pointed as he explains to Paul that the world does not care about him or his country. It is hard to deny that elements of racism played a part in the decisions of world powers and Paul feels betrayed by the false prophet of the west. In one of the most poignant scenes  Paul watches as foreign nationals are evacuated from the hotel. A busload of white faces pulls away  and with them the security forces  leaving the defenseless group of Africans to meet their fate. But events leave little time for self reflection  as there are almost hourly threats against the hotel and the people inside. Eventually the payoffs and bribes no longer work and Paul is left only with words  which he uses to play on the fears of men like General Bizimungu (Fana Mokoena)  creating a sense of power he does not really have. After words fail  only hope remains.Don Cheadle  who plays Paul Rusesabagina  is truly memorable. It is an important performance  and rare  where the actor ceases and only the character remains. Observe the scene when  having returned with supplies  Paul is overcome by what he has viewed on the roads. Cheadle is mesmerizing here  but he is just as nuanced in the smaller moments which makes his breakdown all the more effective and real. He does not falter for a moment. Sophie Okonedo is just as good; she is strong and avoids the \""woman in peril\"" clich\u00e9s so prevalent in film. It is Nick Nolte who reminds us here that he can be an actor of great depth when given the opportunity  and the entire supporting cast helps immensely. HOTEL RWANDA marks a departure for director Terry George  who is from Northern Ireland  and has worked almost exclusively with Jim Sheridan on stories about that region. Here he creates tension without gimmicks and allows the characters to develop. He puts a human face to the abstract bloodshed of Rwanda during the massacres  but avoids preaching or over sentimentalizing the harrowing subject matter. The cinematography  production design and music help George in recreating the time and place. HOTEL RWANDA seems effortless in its portrayal of the events  but these are  in fact  the hardest films to make.It was difficult for me to imagine a film about the genocide in Rwanda as having a PG-13 rating. In a way it is good because the film will reach a wider audience and shed light upon a recent atrocity which was ignored at the time and has been largely forgotten since. Having seen various documentaries on the subject  read participant's accounts and seen chilling photographs of rivers choked with corpses  the true scale of violence was staggering. HOTEL RWANDA does not quite capture the brutality and horror of the events where mobs of people used sharpened car parts and bicycle handles to kill Tutsi as well as Hutu \""traitors.\"" It instead chooses to focus on the personal story of Paul and his efforts. He is a brave man who saved the lives of many through his efforts  although chance seems to have played a large part. The film should also help us look ahead to the events in the Darfur region of the Sudan where many of the same things are happening today and which has been obscured by other world events. The message of HOTEL RWANDA seems to be that something like this can happen at anytime  in anyplace  and that each instance is as worthy of our attention as the next. I hope this film will continue to have an impact but in the long term it is people  not films  that will make a difference. 10/10\tFinally  a movie about human evil that doesn't involve the Holocaust  slavery  Southerners  or Germans! There were two types of depravity in the film - the Hutu militias and the apathetic world that stood by and did nothing knowing full well what was happening.The movie features some memorable acting performances. Don Cheadle was marvelous and thoroughly believable as a dignified man of strength that had to juggle the demands of protecting his family  his hotel  his people  and his identity. Sophie Okendo  who plays his wife  was equally superb as was Nick Nolte in a limited role as UN peacekeeper that really takes his job seriously.Second  the movie was thoroughly riveting from beginning to end and managed to maintain the suspense throughout - we never really knew how this was going to end for the Rusesabagina family and yet we really cared and hoped for the best against all odds.There was a moment in the film in which I cried but whether it was because of the horror the Tutsis experienced or because of the depravity latent in the heart of all mankind  I do not know.There are two moments which will stick with you. First  the memory of the bombastic radio speaker challenging the Hutu militias to \""cut the tall trees down\"" is a haunting angry voice of intense evil.Second  the memory of the unwitting \""friend\"" that spoke so callously about completely annihilating all Tutsis. When Paul indignantly retorts something like \""surely you can't think you can kill all of them \"" he replies \""Why not? We are half way there already!\"" Chilling  just chilling.Great film and it is just too darn bad that a pile of politically-correct mediocrity like Million Dollar Baby can win over outstanding movies like Hotel Rwanda and Ray.\tSo how do you go about making a movie that explains  in enough detail to please everyone  the effects of hundreds of years of European influence  the modern day influence of arms sales from competing European nations to various warring factions  the influence of the UN  United States  civil war and what caused them  etc. etc. - and all of it in a time period that people will be willing to sit through? I think the events dealt with in this movie are far more complicated in their history and causes than people know and some of the criticism is outrageous. I'm waiting for the \""UN is a Trojan Horse on our shore's\"" comments to start. A UN Propagand film - are you serious? and as for the accuracy commentsso the makers of this movie did what hundreds of other movie makers have done in the depiction of complicated events  they used composite characters and altered the time line to make the movie flow. there wasn't one or two Hutu generals - there were a dozen or more and he had to know what to bribe each of them with to get cooperation and protection - but it would have been too complicated to try to depict all of them.I don't think this movie is the new Schindler's list but I think they did a masterful job depicting the horror these people were faced with and their miraculous survival despite the threat from a murderous mob that was in real life right outside the gate of the hotel.\tThis is the true and inspiring tale of one man who tried to do something when his country descended into madness and genocide. Don Cheadle is masterful as our hero and he was deserving of an Oscar and not just a nomination. Its is thanks to him and most of the rest of the cast that we have as good a movie as we do. The problem  for me  with Hotel Rwanda is the casting of Nick Nolte as a UN peace keeper. Every time that Nolte appears on screen I'm pulled out of the movie. No longer am I in Rwanda but on a Hollywood set and big name actors are trying to act. Its distracting and it almost ruins the movie since it takes several minutes after each of his appearances to calm down enough to once again get lost in the story. Nolte aside  this is a great movie and should be seen   not only because its a record of what transpired  but also because its a damn good movie.\tI guess there is no-one who can say that he or she doesn't know what has happened during the genocide in 1994 in Rwanda. The images of all the massacres  often committed with nothing more than machetes  were absolutely horrifying. But on us Belgians this event has perhaps had an even bigger impact than on other Europeans and on Americans. Not only has Rwanda  after Germany's defeat in World War I  long been a Belgian protectorate (no  just as Burundi it has never been a colony. We only had one and that was Kongo)  making that we still have some kind of historical connection to the country. Our government has always helped the Rwandese with military assistance and training (except during the genocide). But we were also personally affected by the genocide when 10 of our UN peace-keepers were brutally murdered in a military camp because they tried to protect one of the Rwandese ministers. Three of them were shot  the others were hacked open with machetes. The images of the paratroopers who cut their blue berets into pieces with their bayonets  once their returned home  will never be forgotten by all those who saw it back then.\""Hotel Rwanda\"" doesn't show anything about that particular event  but it does give a good idea of what the rest of the entire genocide  and the reaction of the international community towards it  was like. This movie tells everything from the perspective of Paul Rusesabagina  an ordinary hotel-manager from Hutu origin who saved the lives of many Tutsi's. While the rest of the Hutu's brutally murdered every Tutsi around him  he not only protected his Tutsi wife and his children  but helped many of her relatives and friends to escape the horror by opening the hotel doors for them. Despite the fact that he didn't get much help from the UN or from the French  he was able to save over a thousand helpless refugees...I would like to say that this is a wonderful movie  but not without adding that I'm not talking about all the murders. What I like so much about this movie is that it shows how a seemingly ordinary and unarmed man was able to stand up against all those militia men  not only protecting the lives of thousand people  who would otherwise have faced a certain death  but risked his own life by doing so and didn't care. If this hadn't been based on a true story  many would have said that it was impossible  but it isn't. All this actually happened  the good things as well as the bad. The makers of this movie have recreated it all very well and certainly have done some great research about the reasons and the attitude of the international community.The acting in this movie was also outstanding. Don Cheadle did a perfect job in his portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina and Nick Nolte was excellent in his role as the Canadian Colonel Oliver  but that doesn't mean that the other  less known actors  weren't at least as good as them. They all did a wonderful job  lifting this movie far above average. If there is one thing that I could have a remark about  than it must be the fact that they speak English  instead of French. But that's such a little detail  that I'm very willing to forget about it. It didn't really bother me and it certainly didn't spoil the rest of the movie for me.Overall this is a movie that should be seen by all. Not only because we should never forget what has happened over there in 1994  but also because we should hope this is a lesson for those who are planning on doing it and for those who never did anything about it. I give this movie a well-deserved 8.5/10.\tHotel Rwanda is a great film. Yes  it has direct ties to a very heart-wrenching part of history  but what makes it powerful is the strong performance by Don Cheadle  an excellent supporting cast  great direction and storytelling.I love movies like this. I very much enjoy movies with historical settings  even if their not always accurate (not a problem with this film). But anyone can make a drama based on historical events. What matters to film is the event gets the proper focus and circles around a handful of important characters. \""Hotel Rwanda\"" does just that: it shows the Rwandan genocide as it occurs within a few square kilometers with the hotel as a focal point. More importantly it shows the tragedy through the eyes of a handful of people (if you focus solely on Cheadle and miss the viewpoint of the main character's wife and children you miss a great deal). This is how great historical dramas are made. Look at \""Patton\""  one of the best WWII films ever made  not because it showed the action any better than any other WWII movie  but it focuses on a single  strong character brilliantly played. \""Hotel Rwanda\"" is such a movie.A great film  great performances (Cheadle was robbed of an Oscar on this one)  and a powerful story. \""Hotel Rwanda\"" should be shown in high schools across the country come fall.9 out of 10. Sometimes it was hard to figure out which side characters were which (perhaps that was the point based on the whole Hutu-Tutsi past)  but that is only a small nit. Otherwise the film is excellent.Barky\tI can't say enough about this movie.I would like to say that Don Cheadle is not simply the best African American actor out there  but is one of the best actors out there period.I would even venture to say he was robbed of the Oscar this year.His performance was subtle  and yet had so many different layers  it is impossible to describe. What Paul Rusesabagina did was simply amazing  and speaks to what one person can do  how one person can make a true difference in the world. This man and Don Cheadle with his amazing performance  truly touched my heart.Kudos also go out to Sophie Okonedo as Paul's unwaveringly supportive and loving wife  and the the children in this movie were also wonderful.This is a movie that speaks to the human spirit and should NOT be missed.\tWhat is it that makes a story worth telling? Yeah  what happened in Rwanda was one of the most horrible (and unnoticed) things in recent history  but how would you tell that story without focusing just on the horror? Hotel Rwanda delivers the task so mercilessly it will leave you breathless. This is a story about priorities  about survival in the most horrific circumstances  about pride and intelligence. Paul (Don Cheadle) is an amazing character. He makes you feel ashamed of yourself. Could you face this sort of thing in the same fashion as he did? I kept asking myself that question the whole time. To be reminded of this atrocities is one thing  but to confront them and still keep a straight and gentle face is another thing. Paul is such an amazing character he's beyond human  and Don Cheadle portrayed this man with such dignity and charisma it left me biting my nails every moment. I also loved Joaquin Phoenix's character. You always wonder what the feelings of journalists would be given the chance to cover a story like this  and I think he hits the mark very close. This is not an entertainment movie  it's a wake-up call for mankind.\tI'm extremely surprised to find that this film is currently #51 in the best 250 films. People don't seem to understand that it is BASED on a true story. Just because it is about something terrible that happened  people instantly change their criteria for what makes a good film. At the end of the day  this film is still poorly directed; has poorly delivered  cringe-worthy dialogue; some kind of product placement in every other scene; two dimensional characters; glosses over the genocide by only referring to it and never actually showing anyone getting killed; has gaping plot holes; and for some reason tries to put the blame of what happened on the Europe and America. Surely  that should be enough to make anyone think a movie is terrible...\tThis is probably one of the most touching stories i have seen in film in the past year. Hotel Rwanda tells the story of a courageous man who is a manager of a five-star hotel in the genocide period. The screenplay is superb  great character that we can all relate to. The direction was quite beautiful and equipped with a suitable and graceful score. The acting was great as well  Cheadle  Sophie Okonedo and Jean Reno all gave great performances. Joaquin Phoenix didn't have many scenes but was great as well. I didn't particularly like Nolte's performance too much  seemed a bit wooden in this one to me. The film however is great  great storytelling  definitely one of the best film of this kind of genre. Style of film-making sort of reminded me of great Iranian film-makers like Kiarostami and even Ghobadi and Majidi  those who have seen these films from international cinema will know what i mean. 9/10\tI really wish people would stop gushing about how GREAT this film is  how it made you CRY  MOAN  WEAP  GENUFLECT  etc. YES  I agree that the film is brilliant. It GETS one's attention. IT is a story powerfully told. Unfortunately  it also inspires a general sense (to my mind  and after reading some of the posts here) of armchair philanthropy. Stasis. Inactivity. It is great that there is a film that takes Africa and individualized Africans figures  seriously as its primary Subject  tells the story from an African point of view. This is the first mainstream film (to my mind  that has done this). Africa  as a concept  is most often seen as a massive  dirty  backwards \""Heart of Darkness\""  unexplored unless by prying  objectifying news cameras (starving children with snot running out of their noses etc.) The fault doesn't lie with the film (it is quite firm about its contempt for the \""West's\"" strategic lack of agency). The problem lies with people like YOU  quite happy to sing the film praises  but not much else. There is a post further down that (flippantly) refers to this film as \""This year's Schindler's List\"". What a cheek! Yes  this may be one of those \""never forget what happened film's\""  but while the Holocaust recedes ever further into history  atrocities of similar proportions still happen on this continent (I am a South-African). The speed and force with which the \""Rwanda\"" happened forced the West (retrospectively) to sit up and listen. Although slower  other protracted battles/hotspots(a misnomer no doubt coined by that beast CNN) continue to shock the mind out of comprehension. Angola  for example only recently (three years ago) ended an over twenty year civil war (see  in Africa its \""on again: and \""off again: so no-one really knows how long these things last and whether or not they ever truly end  case in point: Sudan. The list goes on. To list \""issues\""  rant-style  here would be counter-intuitive  to my mind. Go find out.Hopefully there will be more films about African SUBJECTS in the future.Most of the major supporting actors are South-African (and they all give performances as good as Cheadle's). It was mainly filmed in and around Soweto (in Johannesburg  where I live).Calling this film \""this years Schindler's LIst\"" is  to put it lightly  unconscionable. Think \""historically specific\"" next time  hey? Rant Over.Do something from your end. Find out how. Avoid condescension.\tIt should be noted that a great injustice was committed in the making of Hotel Rwanda. For the most part the story is true  Don Cheadle's character Paul Rusesabagina was a hero amidst terrible acts.The injustice lies in the portrayal of Nick Nolte's character  Colonel Oliver. Oliver is a fictitious person  but there is no denying the comparisons to Romeo Dallaire  a Canadian hero and the man in charge of the UN peacekeeping mission. For whatever reason  it was decided that the true story would be altered for the movie. Dallaire  recently voted as the 16th greatest Canadian ever by a CBC poll  was depicted by Nolte's character as ineffective and a drunk. This is far from the truth. Dallaire had limited resources and insufficient personnel to be able to stop the oppression and genocide  but he stood his ground. The world turned its back on what happened in Rwanda. The UN committed such little resources and soldiers to the mission that there was no chance of success. It is true that hundreds of thousands of people were massacred  but this number would have been considerably higher had it not been for Dallaire.It is unthinkable that such an important man and his actions would be altered in the retelling of this story. A more accurate account of the Rwanda genocide is available. Romeo Dallaire tells the story from his perspective  good and bad  in \""Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda\"". Perhaps one day this story could be retold by Hollywood and give Dallaire the proper recognition he deserves.\tI have yet to see this film but I would like to comment on the first pre-release poster I saw on a huge billboard. The image was very minimal and stark. A black background with a horizontal side-view of a shiny  scuffed machete blade. The only text being a very amateur looking 'Hotel Rwanda' in gold coloured Times New Roman font. Why was this image so powerful? Firstly I could see no clues as to what this poster was advertising  apart from the title obviously but the image itself didn't look like other movie posters  there was something nonconformist and more real about it. No airbrushing  no stylised fonts - just a stark  quite unsettling image of a weapon designed to cause a lot of damage. As much as the poster shook and to some extent impressed me because of it's originality  I thought it was tad insensitive but perhaps that is good for westerners who know so little about what happened. A few days later I could no longer see the original poster  it had been replaced with a more acceptable Hollywood style image  still depicting the machete blade only with airbrushed sad faces of the central characters inside it. That kind of killed my curiosity a bit but nevertheless I'll be renting this out when I have some money. Oh and I rated it 8 to be polite as I haven't seen it yet!\tExcellent movie. Great play by the actors. This movie will be remembered. It shows the constant and repetitive errors that the human kind does time after time. It it also a reminder that even if the world decided to not intervene in the conflict between the Hutu and the Tutsi  this could happen everywhere. Hatred  bigotry  racism and territorial preoccupations fueled this conflict but the abandonment of this part of "
House of 1000 Corpses (2003),"House of 1000 Corpses was well worth the wait. People were understandably a little sceptical of Rob Zombie's debut as a director  but knowing myself that the man is a scholar of the modern horror movie and a raving fanboy himself  I had high expectations of House. I was not disappointed. From the demented and hilarious opening sequence through to the surreal and terrifying ending  Zombie's first foray into direction and writing gives the world of cinema a much needed boot in the pants.Is it gory? Well  yeah  it is  but it's never gory in an absolutely horrific fashion. What's such a pleasant surprise is that the movie  despite being a homage to the bleak and nihilistic 70s horror boom  is full of well-painted  full-bodied characters and rich dark humour. House of 1000 Corpses is an absolute blast to watch  never wallowing in darkness and only really becoming a terror-ride toward the very end  meaning it's a movie that while not for all the family could well put a smile on at least some of their faces.The movies combination of gore-soaked serial-killer horror  Tim Burtonesque visuals and Evil Dead's sense of humour is a fresh turn from a genre currently stuck largely in bleak apartment buildings full of long-faced pouty heroines and even longer-faced pouty ghouls. Yeah it isn't that tense  but it's wickedly funny  wonderfully psychedelic and chock full of demented set-pieces. To be honest  I'd almost forgot what it was like to be entertained by horror before I watched this.A lot of people love to dissect this movie and venerate it's influences  but the bottom line is unlike Kill Bill which relied on you being as nerdy as Tarantino to enjoy it  Zombie's movie is fun whether or not you've seen the movies he doffs his threadbare circus hat to. It's a warped  psychedelic delve into mania that'll make you laugh out loud and keep you on the edge of your seat. Watch it. Watch it ASAP.\tmy sister told me this was the scariest movie ever. I should have known better than to take a 14 year old's advice with a huge lump of salt. This has got to be hands down the biggest waste of time ever. There was no plot and the villains were pathetic. Whatever part of the movie he DIDN'T rip off from other better horror/slasher movies was just a 5th grade exercise in \bet I can gross you out more\"" The \""horror\"" of rob zombie is so childish  I was laughing at how stupid it was. Unfortunately it wasn't funny enough to make up for the hour of my life I will never get back--I tried to watch the entire movie; instead I went back to Blockbuster and demanded my money back. I heard that there's supposed to be a sequel to this piece of garbage. My advice is not to waste time and money on that\tHouse of 1 000 Corpses (2003) marks the directorial debut of Trash/Industrial Artist Musician Rob Zombie. This film was sitting on the shelf for a couple of years before Lion's Gate released it theatrically. A homage of sorts to Zombie's favorite genre  southern fried horror. Throw in Texas Chainsaw Massacre  add a little Eaten Alive and a dash of FunHouse and you'll get the flavor of this film. Four twenty somethings are riding along the back southern roads when they come across a roadside carnival run by an eccentric clown named Captain Spaulding. He gives them a personnel tour of his fun house of horrors and tells them the tale of a local ghoul named Doctor Satan. Inspired by phantasmagorical tale of the good doctor  they decide to search for his grave. Captain Spaulding draws them a map and gives them directions to an area where the Doctor allegedly died. On the road  they meet a pretty blond hitch-hiker who also knows about the legend of Doctor Satan...and a little more! What happens next? You'll have to visit House of 1 000 Corpses!A great film that does what it sets out to do. I'm so glad to see old school grind house horror is back in the mainstream. A sequel is out and it's even better! I have to strongly recommend this movie. You won't regret it!\tIf you really enjoy torture and senseless killing  this film is for you! It has all kinds of twisted people killing scores of innocent people for the hell of it. There are no \""good guys\"" here  just evil people  who I think are supposed to be cool. Which is what is so bothering about this film. Rob Zombie seems to be saying  that murdering and torturing people is fun and hip. You can brag that this film is disturbing and you would be correct  but is that anything to brag about? I guess seeing young girls tied up and tortured is a thrill to somebody that was never able to get them  which is where Zombie and his fans seem to be coming from. It is kind of a revenge film for those losers that never were able to get with the attractive and popular crowd  you know  the future serial killers.\tmy house of 1000 corpses came yesterday (july 21  2005)  i've never seen it before and bought a copy from eBay for \u00a31. i love it.i love it because i know zombie's music and appreciate what he's done plus found it disturbing the same way i did chain saw massacre / exorcist and appreciate what zombie has created. when i first listened to zombie's hellbilly deluxe i kept thinking to myself 'this is like a sound track to a horror movie' and enjoyed house 1000 a lot. The whole flick seemed to be a visual representation of what goes on in his mind when he writes his music tracks. Loved it  and appalled by the brutality in it. that was made worse when it leaved some to your imagination.if you're not familiar with his music or haven't seen any 70's horror films  this isn't the movie for you. go watch silence of the lambs or something Hollywood.\tHouse of 1000 Corpses aspires to be an homage to horror films of the 1970s but instead transforms into what is essentially a bad parody of them. Written and directed by rock music star Rob Zombie  a self-professed fan of 1970s horror films  House of 1000 Corpses hits almost every major beat of a film from that era  and the final result is horrifying  if only because you wonder how anyone would have thought this was a good film when it was greenlit.House of 1000 Corpses leaves no stone unturned in it's attempt to emulate films such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (it's closest cousin)  Last House on the Left  The Hills Have Eyes  and many more. There isn't barely a shred of originality to be found  as almost every major plot element  scene and character is swiped from some other (better) film. And when assembled  House of 1000 Corpses proves that the whole is not merely the sum of it's parts.The plot (what there is of one) is minimal: Four teenagers driving cross-county through the US  Jerry (Chris Hardwick)  Mary (Jennifer Jostyn)  Denise (Erin Daniels) and Bill (Rainn Wilson)  stop off at a gas station run by the rather foul and unsavory Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) which happens to also feature a low-budget theme park style ride called the \""Murder Ride \"" the main attraction of which is local legend Dr. Satan  who experimented on individuals and was eventually hanged at a nearby location. Intrigued by this story  the kids set out to find Dr. Satan's impromptu gallows  only to end up with a flat tire in some rather spooky backwoods environments. A hitchhiker they picked up  Baby (Sherri Moon  Rob Zombie's real-life wife)  offers them shelter at her nearby house  which is inhabited by her mother  known as Mother (Karen Black)  Grandpa (Dennis Fimple)  a towering giant named Tiny (Matthew McGrory)  her monosyllabic brother Rufus (Robert Allan Mukes) and her other brother  Otis (Bill Moseley). After a rather strange dinner and stage show put on by the family  the youngsters attempt to flee their hosts  only to find themselves captured  bound and placed through various mental and physical tortures at the hands of the insane Firefly clan.Pretty much everything in House of 1000 Corpses is overcooked. The actors playing the family flail about wildly  spouting out clich\u00e9d dialogue that is supposed to cause us to feel unease  but instead only elicits stares of incredulity. It would be helpful if the victims were even the least bit three-dimensional  but that is not the case. The four teens are cardboard cutouts  providing us with nary a single sympathetic character. So when the various acts of torture start  lacking any connection to anybody  we are just watching endless scenes of depravity that is so over the top  it is not the least bit scary and instead comes across as an act of a director that seems to believe that the weirdness of what we are watching alone can make some kind of an impact. It doesn't. Anyone familiar with the films Zombie is aping can see his source material shining through  but what he has placed on screen is so overdone  so amped up as to be almost comical  in a rather morbid way. Zombie is trying so hard to live up to his childhood icons that he loses sight about what made those films good in the first place.The film lurches along from scene to scene  and features a subplot where one of the victim's fathers (Harrison Young)  an ex-cop  goes looking for them  that seems to attempt to try to interject some seriousness into the proceedings  but fails miserably with clich\u00e9 dialog and some rather questionable acting. Zombie also edits his film with cutaways shot on video or post-processed to give us glimpses into other scenes in the film  often as counterpoint to the main scene  but these prove to be simply distracting and suggest that Zombie is attempting to be \""arty\"" but is instead merely annoying.The only element of the film that works is it's opening sequence  set in Captain Spaulding's store  where Sid Haig chews the scenery mightily and provides a bit of black humor to the proceedings. He pops up again here and there  and is again diverting  but it's not enough to save the film. Almost all the other actors are just going through the motions  bringing little memorable to the screen.With a title like House of 1000 Corpses  you would imagine there is some gore to be found  and that goes without saying. While not quite the gross-out fest of Hellbound: Hellraiser II  House of 1000 Corpses isn't for those with a weak constitution  especially towards the end of the film  where Zombie pushes his plot and effects to a new level of ridiculousness without a point.It's obvious that Zombie has an affection for the genre  and it is possible that he can create an effective horror film if he would simply pull it back five or six notches and assemble something a little more realistic and low-key. As it stands  House of 1000 Corpses would classify as one of the worst attempts at a horror film in years  and considering some of what I have seen  that is saying a lot.\tOK  so i thought this movie was incredible. the plot was a little crazy but it came together well. i don't understand how people say this is a TCM rip-off... it takes elements from many REAL serial killers and puts it into these characters. tiny would be a pathetic excuse for a leatherface as well. if anything... that TCM re-make ripped this movie off.   making the whole town part of it and all... just like this movie is  which came out before the TCM remake. the movie was shot and acted cheesy for a reason... to try and replicate the late 70's early 80's B-slasher flick  which it did a really good job of creating. the characters give you a definite sense of who and what they are. they're written extremely well. same as the plot  it gets you guessing a little and explains a lot really well. there's some stuff that gets left out  but that's why there's a sequel. so everyone's entitled to their own opinions  but i just think people dislike this for the wrong reasons. it's kinda cheesy cu it's supposed to be. it's really messed up cu it's supposed to be. the only way it's like TCM is that's it's villains are based off of real serial killers (mainly ed gin  which also influenced Hitchcock into writing psycho  but would you say psycho is a rip-off of TCM?). why do you think they have that murder ride trip that they show? so you can see the similarities between these characters and the real killers. so if you don't like it  fine... but if you're gonna call it a TCM rip-off or hate cu it's acting is cheesy... do some homework before you post stuff for other people to see. and BTW  this movie was in theaters.\tRob Zombie made it known that he was emulating the grisly psycho horror films of the seventies with this unsettling retro rehash of bloody murder. You have to be familiar with that period to understand the style he's copying here. Mostly  Zombie seems to rebel against conventionality and embraces innovation in creating this film. Standard storytelling seems to go out the window at regular intervals and an unnerving mood takes over. It doesn't always work and comes across as slapdash  uncertain. I'm beginning to think the seventies really were the best period for certain films  mostly horror  sci-fi and thrillers. I used to think I felt this way because that's when I first began to see films in earnest  but now I'm not so sure. Many others  including Zombie  have the same opinion  regardless.This obviously  more than anything  imitates the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre film from 1974  including the plot (group of traveling young people stumble across the most depraved family in the state). Sid Haig  very active in films of the early seventies  usually in the role of a villain  returns to good form here as Capt.Spaulding  who runs a local horror show and dresses in clown make-up. The strange & perverse family here  which includes momma Karen Black (also in her prime during the seventies)  indulge in pointless sadism with their victims - at least the family in TCM(74) had a rationale  cannibalism. The film continues to follow TCM's pattern through to the end  as a final female victim experiences hellish  unbelievable visions concerning the revelation of 'Dr.Satan ' a local legend which turns out to be true (I think - unless she's hallucinating). You don't really follow a plot by this point  but just absorb the nightmarish images Zombie throws at you  to be digested later. I would've rated this higher if it hadn't so blatantly copied the classic TCM(74).\tThis is exactly why you can't sow wild oats and hope for a crop failure.I think getting turned into a fishguy was probably the best thing that ever happened to glasses-boy  besides having Baby flirt with him. She kind of has a crack problem  with those pants she wears  so she makes hot chocolate for him because the cheerleaders upstairs didn't even try to cheer her up  and her mom's hair is like those cats that were dyed 9 times. Everyone else is like Steven Hawking - really lame! but not smart or with a funny voice or in a wheelchair.Tiny is a real Don Juan - the girls DON JUAN anything to do with him  even though his mom explains how he's a real lady-killer just shy so he goes to his room to eat \""Agatha Crispies\"" cereal out of a dog food bowl  and Captain Spaulding is actually a clown  not a sea captain. When some hick cops stop by he has on a shirt that says \""Pigs Is Beautiful \"" which almost makes sense but cops don't eat fried chicken  even though it's free  just because they don't like clowns. There's even a guy named Goober  or not. Baby lets him keep the change  so you figure her crack problem isn't that bad. Or maybe it is- later on you see this cheap  broken tape deck and feel bad for how they are so poor they can't even pay attention to stuff like that.\tThe song says it all  'This is a house built on sin.' This movie has a somewhat 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' quality to it. But make no mistake  it is an original idea. A group of young adults are exploring the fascinating little places found in rural America and come across this clown fellow with a little gas station/horror ride. After learning the legend of Dr. Satan  they decide to pursue. They come across this rather eccentric family of fun loving evildoers  and all hell brakes loose.The villains of this 'House of 1000 Corpses' have their own little eccentricities that make you fall in love with them  even if they are murdering sadists  he he. Baby has this youthful giggle as she engages in her inhumanity towards her house guests. She also does an excellent Betty Boop impression  though she doesn't look like her. The long haired artistic rebel has his insane paranoid outlook as he brakes societies shackles and frees his mind to do his work. Wait 'till you see his art  you'll love it. The mother is hospitable but a bit too flirtatious to call a lady.This movie is one wickedly humorous horror film done on a pretty low budget  though not nearly as low as many others. I highly recommend this for those who are fascinated by the nature of evil  for this movie certainly portrays it well.Definitely a 9 out of 10. I look forward to Zombie's next production.\tWhen I saw House of 1000 Corpses for the first time  shortly after it's release  I wasn't all that impressed. Rob Zombie's homage to seventies exploitation flicks plays out much like a backing video for him to play his songs against  and that; combined with the MTv style editing ensured that I didn't enjoy myself all that much. I've seen more seventies exploitation flicks since then  however  and have become much more tolerant of fast editing styles; and so upon my second viewing  I found that this is actually a very good horror film. For a rock singer  Rob Zombie has a surprising amount of directorial talent; and it's always obvious that he respects the films that lead to this one being made. The plot is typical seventies exploitation  and it follows a group of teenagers that find themselves at the mercy of a Texas Chainsaw Massacre-style family's sadistic sickness. What follows is a tour de force of sickness  gore and violence that replaces any notion of plot or characters with just simple visual potency. This isn't the sort of film that will top 'best of all time' lists; but if you're in the mood  Rob Zombie's ride won't disappoint.Zombie has given us a number of sick characters to shock and entertain. We've got the sick clown  name of Captain Spaulding; the beautiful  yet sick  'Baby'; her equally odd mother  hideously burned Tiny  hideously sick redneck 'Otis'  and best of all; a deformed \""doctor\""  delighting in the name of Dr Satan! If you know Zombie's music  nothing in this film will really surprise you. Rob delivers old style heavy rock music  with a nu-metal swing to it; and House of 1000 Corpses is an old-school horror flick  with new techniques added. Zombie gets to enjoy himself by entwining sepia shots of his characters into the mayhem  along with various other techniques. Zombie direction isn't all about throwing in nice visuals  however; he does have some talent  and this is shown best in the brilliant scene that sees Otis shoot a policeman! There seems to have been something of a resurrection for good horror films since the millennium; and while we're still not back in the golden age that this film is a tribute to; this decade has been a hell of a lot better than the nineties - and this film is one of the reasons why.\tI've been waiting so long to get round to seeing this movie  and now that I have?Thank God I bought it cheap on Amazon.Is it supposed to be a horror film  a spoof  what? I don't know. What it is  is dull. When nothing had happened by about the half way mark  I thought great  they're obviously building to a gross out climax. Imagine my surprise when the credits rolled. It's a horror movie without suspense  without gore  without... HORROR! The family are obviously psychos  they obviously kill a lot of people.What a shame that doesn't make it on screen. What you get is 2 hours of clich\u00e9d 'mad folk'  and one girl in particular screaming non-stop.Credit where it's due; on the back of the DVD case it reads 'harks back to a golden age when horror really meant horror and the guarantee of cinematic shocks was more of a threat than a promise'.They weren't lying! I thought it was a typo!Lame. Anyone want to buy a second hand DVD?\tGosh. Where to begin? Everything in this movie was bad: the script  the directing  the acting  the sets  and even the make-up. This movie was not scary... at all. Despite what I was expecting  it wasn't even gory. It had some gore but it was pretty tame. The only thing positive I can say about it is a character named Dr. Satan looked pretty cool. He was very original could have been horrifying in a different movie. However this does not make up for the previous hour and a half of stupid dialog  cheap scares  and the most puzzlingly bad last half hour of a film that I've seen in a while. This movie misses its mark completely. Sorry  Rob Zombie (but you did better with the sequel).\tI already had a user comment for \""House of a 1.000 Corpses\"" submitted here on this site  dated over a year ago and\u0085um\u0085not very praising. In fact  my first viewing of this film was so disappointing that I excessively discouraged other people here to see it. Rather than to simply ignore the old comment and pretend I never bashed it  I wish to write a new \u2013 more positive \u2013 review  if it were only to convince other people (who also disliked at first) to give it a second change. Several factors (like the praising reviews on \""The Devil's Rejects\""-sequel and conversations with fellow horror fans) nearly forced me to re-watch \""House of a 1.000 Corpses\"" and I'm glad I did. This truly is a film that requires multiple viewing before one can properly judge it. Rob Zombie's style is often innovating and so overwhelming that it might look overly hectic at first but  in reality  his dedication towards obscurity and his knowledge on classic cinema is one of the best things that could ever happen to the horror genre. And that is something you (or at least I) have to discover with repeated viewings\u0085 The power of this film lies in the fact that the screenplay covers all kind of successful horror premises. Serial killers  mad doctors  a family of crazies  deranged clowns  devil-worshipers\u0085.you name the type of terror and \""House of a 1.000 Corpses\"" features it! This movie is a small revival of the entire horror genre all by itself. No extended and boring intros or pointless red herrings in this film  \""House\u0085\"" is straightforward and surefooted sickness from start to finish and you're given almost no time to breathe. Some of the sequences in this film are so damn close to brilliant that I can't possibly figure out why I didn't love them right away!! The execution-scene guided by the moody \""I Remember You\""-song  for example  is amazingly atmospheric and quite unsettling. Although Rob Zombie's directing skills are still open for improvement (the abrupt climax  overly rough editing)  his debut is a staggering gorefest that every horror fan has to experience\u0085repeatedly! Bring on the sequel\u0085I'm ready now!!\tWhen I sat down to watch this movie  I was expecting to leave it thinking  \""Man  that is seriously messed up!\"" but unfortunately  that was not the case. Instead  I left thinking \""I wasted my time on THIS??\"" Sadly  the movie was filled with incoherence and monotony  instead of suspense and excitement. This movie is nothing more than a pathetic attempt at the horror genre by someone who thinks that these types of movies can be considered successful by how much blood stains there are on someone's shirt  or by the amount of disfigurements each character obtains. Rob Zombie is wannabe. Nothing more and nothing less. If you watch this movie being a pillow and a soft blanket  because I guarantee you will fall asleep after the first 20 minutes.\tYou shithead  how can you say the music there is great!! It completely spoils the whole movie - makes it a comedy instead of a horror. It's the damned modern style of a movie - many flashes of a scary moment and simply that hectic style of progress typical for the recent movies. Too many changes from one scene to another  those slow motion passages and mainly the TERRIBLE music (kind of country)  all of this and also lack of suspense contribute to comedic character of the movie and spoils its horror essence! Some of you may like it but I better recommend you not to watch it and save your time. Simply there's not consistent progress as opposed to the great 70s and 80s horror movies that are consistent and have suspense in them (Suspiria and other Argento's movies from that time). I must only say: Golden 70s and 80s movies  really golden!\tfrustration: thats the word that comes to mind when seeing this movie (and annoyance). this tissue thin story with unexplained and random characters is a chore to watch. why are these things here  why are they just hanging around and why are they scary? rob zombie asks a lot by just putting them there no explanations really  and expecting no resistance to the story. even if there was some sort of back story i was to bored to notice or care. now don't think i wanted to hate this movie  quite the opposite  knowing robs back-ground of bring a horror movie fan confused me even more as to why this was so bad. surly he could have wrote something better  scarier  more meaningful to the genre  oh well  bad debut but better luck next time\tI had high hopes for this movie... I thought Rob Zombie's style of gonzo horror would translate well to a full length picture.I was  however  wrong.Zombie lost something when he moved to the big screen. He lost a sense of fun. There were a lot of good attempts  or at least attempts with potential  at making homages to some of the classic cult horror memes that Zombie has used in his musical acts. But they just sort of collapsed on screen  like a flan in a cupboard. What resulted was a mush of MTV style camera tricks  some colourful characters  and some pretty brutal violence. The problem was that these characteristics never coalesced into any kind of whole  and after the first half hour or so  it got pretty damn boring. The rest of the film seemed to meander with no particular direction  just a string of scenes of sadism  peppered with lame cuts and cheesy camera angles.You can tell Zombie was trying  somewhere in there was a seed for a great tribute to grindcore horror. But Zombie just didn't seem to have what it takes as a director to pull it together and make it work.\tFour kids are writing a book about roadside attractions. At Captain Spaulding's Museum  they learn about the legend of Dr. Satan (Dr. Satan? Now that's just silly). They decide to investigate  and of course  these meddling kids (but no silly dog) don't solve any crimes. They end up at The House of Poor Acting and Recyled Story lines  where carnage ensues. The rednecks there overuse the word \""pussy\"" so much that you may be led to believe that you're either in a no-kill cat shelter or talking about guys in attendance at a Rob Zombie concert. Moronic police investigate  and there's a great (by great  I mean terribly boring) 90 second scene (which seems to last for agonizing days)  that's supposed to be suspenseful (but is actually ridiculously stupid)  with a redneck's gun against a cop's head. That's actually the most original thing in the film  because no other director in history would ever waste that much time or film shooting it.One common aspect of horror movies is that the characters are likable  you're supposed to want to root for them. These kids are all assholes. I was glad to see them get slashed.Rob's idea of \""artistic directing\"" is to throw in a couple of nonsensical negative or distorted images between every couple of scenes. It doesn't work. It's a waste. I can't say a single good thing about this movie. It borrows  no  steals  its content from every other horror movie ever made. I would tell Rob to go back to his day job  but he's not very good at that  either (did you hear anything off of his last album?). There is not a single original idea  scene  character  or shot in this entire movie. It's so bad  the host from MTV's Singled Out is in a starring role. Due to this movie  I'm starting a campaign to ban film in the USA.\tThe thing behind this movie is that it tries to be so gritty  it outdoes it self and ends up to disappointing and leaves one wishing death upon these people. Now  I know its typical of these movies directed by a guy called \""Rob Zombie\"" to be sadistic and shocking. But this movie is overkill. I didn't like it  nor do I recommend it. See it if you've seen every other movie in the world. Or if you're a goth. I don't think this movie is aimed for a general audience  but for more sadistic psychos. Saw was a sadistic movie  and it was GREAT. But this one is so hopelessly creepy(not the good creepy) its a hard pill to swallow while watching. It just makes you sick to your stomach you don't like it. Some very gory scenes were in the movie....in the wrong way! Raping girls  killing people  eating cocoa puffs through a gimp mask uh...."""
House of Wax (2005),"the acting in this movie has the quality of a year 8 drama class  the surprises of a power rangers show ( every moment is predictable)and the depth of a puddle.the character are unlikeable idiots   there is a obvious attraction between (the actors not the characters) the supposed twins which ruins the idea of them being brother and sister completely. Paris takes the cake with the worst acting as she lets her breast do it for her  preturding in every scene shes in with that laughter too \ he......he......he\"".there only two reasons to see this flick; one is the obvious see Paris die ( though i think a pole through the head really wouldn't have affected her as she does not have a brain to destroy in the first place but any way)and second is the haunting beauty of the final scene in which the house of wax melts.\tthis film is the worst film i have EVER seen. the acting ... it is indescribable. if we take the example of Paris Hilton. that girl has no clue about acting!!! and mostly i was surprised by chad Michael Murray and Jared Padalecki. for both i was really sure that they would not play in such lain movie. and their performance is definitely not glamorous. both of this actors have done good stuff. but this is the low of their career. i would say that the screen play on its own way is not bad. it has some potential to be a horror movie. the idea of the film is quite good. but that is all what is good in this film. if people who created this film would put more effort  then the film would be \""horror movie\"".with some other actors and more effort this film could be better. but that way is just another terrible movie in the line.\t\""House of Wax\"" (2005) Dir. Jaume Collet-Serra It's become something of a clich\u00e9 with film critics or movie reviewers to begin their reviews of \""House of Wax\"" by confirming whether or not Paris Hilton can act. Obviously most of the reviews will have extremely negative comments about Hilton's performance  but I really don't think she was as dreadful as you might expect. Perhaps Hilton might not have really wanted to be an actress by ambition or gained her part in this movie through hard audition and practice routines  the way she is indicates she probably woke up one morning with a hangover and decided she might go out and begin acting today.However  her performance really isn't that bad. Maybe this is just me being biased since I do enjoy \""The Simple Life\""  I find Hilton extremely attractive  and enjoy seeing what she's up to in every other magazine  but I do also think she does reasonably well with a small part. Her chase scene and showdown with the killer particularly is one of the film's best sequences  and since Hilton doesn't really have that much to do in the movie (and what she does have to do she does adequately  sometimes even charmingly - I enjoyed the \""yes  let's follow the smell...why?\"" scene with Elisha Cuthbert)  critics who rant that she gives the year's worst female performance are completely unfair  they are most probably simply hating Paris in the movie because she's Paris.Now that we've passed that fiasco  the film overall was an enjoyable night out - it had everything you look for in this genre and left me feeling satisfied and entertained throughout.Personally I didn't find the movie very scary  but it did have some very good boo frights (the mirror one especially)  and the wax people were genuinely creepy. The film manages to maintain a great atmosphere  there's a constant chill in the wind in this deserted and rundown town  you can tell something's wrong the moment they set foot in the town (if it's not already obvious from trailers or reading what the film's about).I noticed to my great surprise that the filmmakers attempted to develop these characters  which leads to it being dragged out a little too long. While I did respect this decision to try and add some meat to the bones of the six teenagers  it never really works as naturally as it did in 2003's \""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\""  such a brilliant success that year that it now seems like the slasher movie to beat. Most of the character/non-waxy material in \""Wax\"" just feels unnecessary in the long run  the only character who benefits from this period of 'development' is Chad Michael Murray  awkwardly unlikeable and harsh at the start  he becomes more sympathetic and likable after we hear a little about his life and begin to come to terms with why this guy is the way he is. I was expecting to hate the overexposed Murray in this film but he ended up being one of my favourite characters in the movie.\""Wax\""'s deaths and scares may not come as fast as you may expect  but they are definitely worth waiting around for. This film  unlike so many of the slashers being released lately  doesn't hold back on the gore and doesn't let the gorgeous celebrities (even those who survive) to go out gracefully.I have another complaint that I see other reviewers and movie fans have had with this most-enjoyable film: Paris Hilton  nor any of the other characters in the film  never touch wax and say \""that's hot\"". A pet peeve  but it's something I was looking for. Never mind though - \""House of Wax\"" is a lot of fun and will immediately fall into the good graces of horror fans. Enjoy! 7/10\tHouse Of Wax (directed by Jaume Collet-Serra) has had many bad reviews. Why? I ask. This isn't a terrible movie. It is a typical slasher flick. Many of the old fogies that review this give one or none. Which it clearly doesn't deserve.I saw it on opening day in Australia (July 14th) at a night session. Most were silent during this. Up until the long awaited death of Paris Hilton as expected  a few cheers here and there. I walked out realising I hadn't seen a great movie but an enjoyable one.The plot is typical of a slasher. Group of kids going to a football game experience car trouble. Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) and her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki) go to the town of Ambrose to get a fan-belt  while Paige (Paris Hilton)  her boyfriend Blake  Nick (Chad Michael Murray) and his comical friend Dalton stay put.Carly and Wade go to the House Of Wax and this is when trouble starts. From here on the cast get knocked off one by one in gory  bloody ways.This movie is great for one reason  it returns to the good old slasher films. Gory deaths are a-plenty in this movie. Acting is OK for a slasher. Cuthbert is a good leading lady  most of the men (and Hilton) are there for looks.3/5\tI didn't think it was possible to be more unimpressed with House Of Wax. I stand corrected! First of all people don't go and see a horror movie only to see people getting killed  cause you can see that in any other movie  but rather to get scared(that's right)!! I saw House Of Wax at 2 am and all I could think about was how much until it ended... everything in this movie was predictable. There where no surprises! This movie couldn't create more than 5 seconds of suspense! This can at most be cataloged as a thriller... If you want a horror movie try The Ring because even if you've seen it before it's a lot better than seeing this for the first time! The whole concept of a house being built 100% out of wax is pretty dumb and not to mention that it's not really that scary... From the moment they say the house is really made of wax I am sure you can guess what's going to happen to it... Totally predictable!! Frankly  I'm surprised that House Of Wax got such a high rating cause I've seen better movies get worse ratings and i don't know why this one got a 5! What a waste of time!\tThe modern Hollywood horror film and originality  two things that go together like ITV and \""essential Saturday night viewing\"".Well 'House Of Wax' is yet another remake  though I use the word 'remake' very liberally  this has more in common with' The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 'than the 1953 Vincent Price flick of the same name.A group of obnoxious bickering US teenagers who listen to rap and metal  smoke dope and drink beer  have a run in with some mad redneck.The men are all tough and macho  the woman  obviously  are attractive and wear small tops.Indeed the film-makers are so desperate in this movie that they cast that waste of a sperm/egg liaison Paris Hilton  coming soon to your local multiplex Abi Titmuss no doubt! The movie starts of at a snails pace .....and then slackens  indeed in a 100 minute movie it's not until the 50 minute mark that we get the first on-screen murder.Things do then pick up a bit  but not much.We get a nice decapitation and Hilton get's a wooden stake through her head  though surely it would have still missed her brain by a good 6 inches!! There is a rather unexciting 'twist' at he end but after enduring this movie you'll be resembling wax in the brain department.\tHouse of Wax is one of those films where the predictability is expected  therefore the goodness of the film heavily relies on it's content and actors not necessarily it's plot outline. In my opinion  the actor part of it was almost a huge disappointment. Walking into the theater i expected terribly acting by Hilton's part  but of course giving the benefit of the doubt i was willing to consider  of course in the first moments it was obvious that i should've trusted my instincts.Although i may add  admit it! half the people in the theater are there just because Hilton is also there. Nonetheless  i found the villains to be disturbing and psychopathic enough to freak me out a little- but only a little. Overall i found the film to be of average quality  due to its impressive special effects and somewhat intriguing characterization. Unfortunately i found there were more cons then there were pros  with the plot not taken to the fullest of it's potential  some bad casting choices  and of course one of the lamest endings in a horror movie i have seen in a very long time. I'll be nice 5/10 is as far as i'll go  i find that although this film has some intriguing aspects towards it  House of Wax isn't that great at being a scary horror movie  this is definitely not the definition of a great horror flick- in fact Scooby-Doo is probably scarier than this.\tIf you are put off seeing this movie by thinking that Paris Hilton can't act  or any other actor/actress for that matter  then i'm telling you to think again. This movie was really one of the most scariest films i have ever seen. All of the actors/actresses chosen were perfectly suited for the characters and made the film feel more believable  than i ever thought imaginable. The effects used were of a very high standard. Even at parts of the movie i knew were going to happen  i still jumped in my seat  it was that well developed. So my advice is to check the movie out. It might surprise you how scared you'll get from the captivating performance.\tOn one hand the film is full of inexplicably dumb sequences  which should make a decent viewer loose any interest in it  but on the other there are scenes  which are so great  that the movie immediately justifies itself. So let's see... First of all I gotta tell  that (and it is quite a common clich\u00e9 of modern horror films) the only relatively smart character is the black guy. Blake  pretty well played by Robert Richard by the way  had made numerous sane proposals  which  if they had been accepted by this bunch of white teens  could have saved their lives. But unfortunately the whites in the film  except for the maniacs  who are pretty witty  are actually one dumber than another. The characters are so dumb  that it somewhat harms the credibility of the movie. Here I gotta mention  that for the first time in a very long time I was actually siding with the killers  hoping  that they would kill all those morons as soon as possible! The guys are so stupid  that not only they decide to stay for the night next to a stinky graveyard  full of animal corpses  for two consecutive nights  prefer to return to an abandoned & creepy place instead of being patient enough to just wait in a traffic jam on the highway  but also keep on breaking in houses & shops snooping around in an utterly insolent manner. I mean  if I hypothetically invite a stranger to my home supposedly to help him  but what the stranger does is snooping through my personal belongings  then will I get mad  even if I am not a crazed maniac? Oh  sure I will! Yet some points of the story were good. I actually liked the fact  that two main characters are twins  which are quite different & they are opposed by Bo & Vincent Sinclair  also twins & also different. As for an attempt to develop multiple story lines & sub-plots... Well... The storyline with Paige Edwards's (played by Paris Hilton) supposed pregnancy is just straight ludicrous! Why should we care? Yet  I can't say  that the storyline with Wade  the dumbest idiot of all of them  refusing to move to New York  because he is afraid of is any better. I liked the villains though... I mean they are really crazy killers. Some scenes are impressive too: especially I liked the fake funerals  movie theater scene & burning house of wax. The visuals are good & I don't mean Paris Hilton's butt here  thought it's really good too. Some funny jokes are also there. There are some meaningful moments as well  despite the general idiocy of the characters  and this is the director's merit.\tThis is a hardcore horror movie. There's gore here  there and everywhere. There are almost unidimensional characters... But I like it. Once you have seen the first gore scene  you're distressed for the whole rest of the time. The music is at times perfect for the scene  raising the anguish you feel to the top. I had a bad time while expecting and finally watching the gore scenes  but in the relaxing moments I felt better. Something like what you feel when you leave a roller-coaster. Ah  and the final scenes are pretty original. I recommend you not to miss it  but if you don't stand realistic and explicit gore  then you'd better avoid it.\tHeaps entertaining  violent  funny  creepy and cheesy :) A horror movie to last  holds up with the greats! A cool story line  acting was pretty poor but who cares  its a cheesy horror movie so who needs academy award winning acting? Not me! I was pleasantly surprised with how well done the movie was. It has everything you need for an enjoyable horror movie. Violence was awesome  brutal! I couldn't believe how well done the gore and violence was. Elisha Cuthbert is scorching hot in it and Paris tops it off. The movie moved through things quick enough so you didn't lose interest or the curiosity of what was next. The idea of the wax museum has always been a great idea and they did it justice with this one A+ I say!\tI'm not quite sure who would walk into this movie expecting anything other than a lamebrained slasher movie. House of Wax is exactly that--a lamebrained slasher movie. Don't expect heaps of intelligence to be nestled into these idiot characters' heads  and don't expect a story that makes any kind of sense  or that could actually happen in real life. DO expect some of that sweet  sweet blood and gore that we all know  love  and cherish. That's the only reason why we go to see this gruesome cheese  anyway. I will say this: Paris Hilton gets it GOOD. And I mean  GOOD. Her death alone would make this worth renting with your blockbuster \""freedom pass.\"" Or maybe you'd rather rent something decent. Whatever. Your call.\tI have explained my position about horror movies before; many times. I don't hate all horror movies  I've seen a few that I love but then there are not lots of them which captured me or anything similar. Less during these days  where groups of young people go somewhere and by different reasons gets killed. All of them except for the ones who'll be the survivors; the heroes or however you prefer to call it.These films are either remakes or original new stories. I haven't seen them all  but I know; \""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\""  \""The Amityville Horror\"" and just to avoid making the list longer  one I recall watching called \""Wrong Turn\"". Some boys and girls had a problem in the road and were chased by \""human monsters\"" in the forest. I believed two of them survived.Now this other one  \""House of Wax\""  a remake of an old movie I didn't see. So I won't make comparisons  I'll just take on the recent picture; where some boys and girls have a problem in the road and\u0085And I'm not telling anything because you know it and you know it better  I believe  if you saw the old version. However the case  what I always say is that I don't mind the ending in a horror film because it's impossible to change it  but I mind the way the filmmakers get to it.The last time I checked (\""Wrong Turn\""  I have in mi head how bad it is) the people barely knew each other and they were killed without a reason  or in other words  I couldn't figure why those \""human monster\"" killed them; it was totally nonsense. This of course works for those crazy horror fans  who love to see blood all over places and heads getting cut  and so on. That's why horror films always get the best of directors  visually speaking.All of this is included in \""House of Wax\""  but with extra ingredients. These ingredients are the ones that attract a person like me  who's not in only for the things I said before. The blood  the deaths  everything occurs  but for a reason. So  the killers are brothers  Bo and Vincent (both played convincingly by Brian Van Holt)  and their story goes way back  and their motives departure from that story\u0085There's also confrontations between the brothers  and between the youngsters  who are not extremely close  but in a way share strong bonds.And I wonder what would have been of these characters in other actors' skin. I say it because anyone knows by now what a good actress Elisha Cuthbert is. She is very solid in her role in this film and right now I'm praying God so that she leaves her hair the way she is wearing it in the movie. Like Elisha  Chad Michael Murray is known for his beauty  but he possesses the gifts and the personality to create defined roles. If you were wondering  Paris Hilton works perfectly  at least for what she needs to do. The cast is completed by the versatile Jon Abrahams  the monotone but charming Jared Padalecki and the rigid Robert Ri'chard. Teens go to see the movie because they think these persons are cute  but they forget they are professionals.Then in my words the result is: non-stop entertainment. Brothers Hayes take a step into the different side  and get their credit for making the ride not as stubborn as it could have been. The Spanish \""beginner\"" Jaume Collet-Serra doesn't seem a beginner at all  because he's feature looks simply beautiful  and that has to be a unanimous judgment. He created his own detailed world and even if it would lead to my death  I would like to see it.\tThe best thing about this movie is Chad Michael Murray. He is so hot he could melt the House just by looking at it! Apart from him there wasn't much to this. The special effects were cool and I did jump out of my seat about ten times but it couldn't really be classified as a horror. That said I have to admit I did have nightmares that night but I'm putting that down to the amazing job the make-up artists did on Vincent. He was seriously freaky looking! It was kinda hard to believe that Nick and Carly were brother and sister 'cos I kept expecting them to rip each others clothes off. The best death scene was Paris Hilton's  it was by far the most gruesome. I didn't think that she would last that long and she's not that bad an actress really. All in all it wasn't a bad movie and I actually liked it. It's one of those films you go see with a gang of your friends and you shouldn't take it seriously for a minute. The last twist is great and I didn't see it coming.\t2005  for me has been a good year for horror movies  with the exception of The Ring 2. I thought House of Wax was a very entertaining slasher flick  with a theme other than just a deranged serial killer. This movie had a great teen cast which included Elisha Cuthbert  Chad Micheal Murray  and the one and only Paris Hilton. While I was expecting some pitiful acting  the acting really wasn't that awful and even Paris Hilton did exceptionally well. Although it seemed alittle obvious of what was about to occur to each character  the deaths were still great. At many scenes I found myself thinking \""how will they escape?\"" or \""where will they hide?\"". there was no nudity in this movie but Paris Hilton did strip down into her lingerie. This movie was also gory and had great death. It includes a finger cut off decapitation  skin turned to wax  skin peeled  a rusty pole through the head  a knife in the throat  a baseball bat bashing  and quite a few foot stabbings. If this all sounds appealing to you  I would be sure to see this movie in the future  like when it comes out on DVD  which may include actress Emma Lung's death scene.\tI have not seen the original Vincent Price version  so I can't tell whether or not this one is better or not. But overall this film is very good. The story is pretty simple a group of college kids go on a road trip  and through a series of events end up in some weird town  featuring the main attraction  The House of Wax. Added into the mix are the psychotic caretakers who want to add them to their collection. This film is filled with a lot thrills and scary moments that should keep you on the edge of your seat from 90 minutes. Of the actors  Chad Michael Murray and Elisha Chubert are tops. This is a good popcorn movie  so don't expect a masterpiece in the tradition of Hitchcock.\tI think the fact that Paris Hilton didn't have to audition for house of wax says it all. She has no discernible talent and she gets by in this film by playing the only role she is capable of: herself - an ego-maniacal uber-slut. The film itself is exactly what you would expect from the title - teens fleeing through the night from a saditic killer in the wilds of America. Who will Survive? Will the Killer get away with his dastardly plans? The real question is...Who Cares?This film is formulaic and typical of Hollywood films that allow high profile and yet essentially talentless people to appear on the big screen. Johny Knoxville anybody.....?\tIt's lame  it's stiff  it's poorly acted (don't get me started on Hilton). Stay away from this \""Texas Chainsaw\"" ripoff.With the exception of the beautiful Elisha Cuthbert  (and even she can't carry the film that far)  there is no talent involved here. What was everybody thinking? A complete reenvisioning of \""House of Wax\"" brings you your typical slasher with a group of attractive kids who are stalked by killers in the woods. And they live in a wax house.Not much of a plot to speak of and only one or two genuine scares  this is an overall failure. Paris Hilton's death isn't even worth watching as it's highly unrealistic. I'm sorry  I just have come to hate this movie so badly.*1/2 out of **** stars. Beautiful cinematography wasted. That's what gets the star.\tThe main reason i went to go see the movie was because of all the well known actors  so the fact that the movie was actually good really satisfied my night.In the first thirty minutes or so  although nothing suspenseful happens  we do get a rather clear view of what the characters are like and several comical moments.When the movie eventually got going  i was clinging on to my seat  scrunching my face up at gory bits and yelling commands at the characters when they weren't doing something that was blatantly the correct thing to do. Although i may have cringed during some of the really bloody bits  i still enjoyed watching them and thought that the effects and make-up were very well done  especially the special effects in the last scene.Memories of the movie  \""House of 1000 corpses\"" flashed in my head as i watched \""The House of Wax\""  for the concept was fairly similar however \""House of 1000 corpses\"" was more serious and shocking.This movie was also a hide and go seek movie. The victims always went and hid  the killer crept around and then BOO! He/she finds them and chases them for a bit until the victim hides again  waiting for the killer to find him/her. This can sometimes get irritating.I liked the fact that when a main character acknowledged the death of another  they reacted strongly to it and did not just forget about it in the next two minutes of the movie unlike some other horror films. All in all the movie has squirmy  jumpy  funny  scary and suspenseful moments topped with good acting  make-up and special effects that made it worth while to watch  for me at least.\tSPOILERS************ Thought this was great  even got to see Paris get it in the forehead. LOL It was cool  I don't know why its not higher rated. Great Originality and Pretty Damn Scary Too! Lot of great acting especially for new comers. I thought Paris did a pretty good job too  she actually seemed like a real person and not one of the wax figures like she does in real life he-he The plot was original and had a lot of detail. I liked the way it all came together in the end  like when the twins were laying together being covered in wax  it was the same position they were in at birth. I'd give it a look. It Scared the crap out of me and a few friends. I hate Paris but I gotta give her props for doing this movie  she should do a real movie with substance. See it :)"""
Hustle & Flow (2005),"This film left me satisfied. I think Terrance Howard showed off his acting style and to me was at the top of his game. I've always admired him on camera - the quiet  yet intense persona  like a man who has seen life hard and this part has endeared me to him for some time to come. I liked this film so much; I can't believe I was rooting for a pimp to succeed in his endeavor! The movie was gritty  sweaty and very entertaining.Every actor in this film was a delight to watch on screen. In addition  the soundtrack was \bumping\"" and I left the theater with the music running through my head and I don't even like rap! Gotta go find the soundtrack - hope it's as good as the movie! Excellent film...go see it! Two thumbs way up!\tI thoroughly enjoyed this entrancing and engaging movie ... as did my two hip-hop loving sons  ages 22 and 23  respectively.No stereotypes  just a bunch of complex people with hopes and dreams like every one. Great cast  writing  direction.This movie is the perfect antidote to the insipid pap Hollywood is churning out these days (years?). In other words  no marketing people were called in for casting or story conferences ... and somehow they managed to pack humor  pathos  rage  love  a whole range of very human characters without the help of an MBA or product placement specialist into the movie. No Burger King tie-ins either  that I know of.A lot of love went into Hustle & Flow. Best movie of the year so far. Some great music  too. Loved the scene in the church - an amazing song.\tThe Story  as an original screenplay  could be considered for an Academy Award. The acting is world class and Terrence Howard brought the type of performance that... Well  let's just say that he should be considered seriously for all the major decorations that an actor can receive this year based on a single performance... Seriously. The entire cast as an ensemble earned their checks!!! (Okay  Anthony Anderson and Ludicrous were okay  but they did their job). Bottom line... See this movie. There were people in the movie theater  at which I saw this film  that had interesting reactions. Several people were expecting a \""movie\"" that was basically an extended rap video. If that's what you're looking for (50 cent fans)  you will not find it here. This is a \""film\"". Art. Truth. Maturity. The medium was definitely respected. (Make no mistake  there is some real grit to this film!)See it.\tI really thought this movie was excellent  if not one of the best I've seen this year. Great story  very inspirational to the \""little guy with a big dream\"". I've been a fan of Terrance Howard for years and am very happy to see him finally get the spotlight he should have had a long time ago. Why he hasn't is beyond me. He's got the talent in bucketfuls and has a great yet unique look. Before I knew his name  I used to call him the \""really good black guy with the green eyes\"" that was in so many films and the occasional music video. Taryn Manning also really helped make this movie for me as the lovable hooker with a sweet heart. One thing I appreciated - that usually drives me nuts - is that you really got to know and CARE about all the characters. You know how they met  why  what their dreams were and you cared to see them achieve it. The entire audience was laughing  gasping or sucking in their breaths during the film and it's just a shame I had to drive so far to see it. It's not playing in any of the theaters around my house...but I'm OK to get in the car for something good. Did it for Layer Cake  too. Anyway  no spoilers here...just a great film (Singleton can't make anything bad) that was a real inspiration. Speaking of real  I'm glad he kept it real with the Skinny Black/bathroom scene and didn't \""Hollywood\"" ending it. That's exactly what usually happens in that situation.\tI loved it. It wasn't just about hip hop. It was about someone finding who you are and working for your dreams. Terrence D. Howard was very impressive. He showed the emotion that's rarely depicted of a pimp  hustler  or rapper for that matter. Hopefully this is the type of role that can propel Terrence into bigger roles   just as Collateral & Ray did for Jamie Foxx. Hollywood need these actors.Also as a hip hop lover it was cool to see the sound & way of life of the 'Dirty South\"". As a East coaster from NY that was a first where the Southern hood is represented well. I thought Taryn Manning  Anthony Anderson  & Ike Hayes were exceptional performances.\tI saw the movie this week and thought it was absolutely AWFUL !!! The acting be the lead character who payed the role of DJay was atrocious. I have seen better acting in a Christmans play. His accent was unbelievable  I say this because I am born and raised in Memphis. The story plot was like a bite off of the life of Ice-Tea.The lighting was terrible and the rap in it was whack. This movie was worst than WOO with Jada Pickett Smith. It is definitely not a movie to take your kids to see along with you. There is a lot of foul language that just doesn't hustle or flow for the story line. It was almost like watching a high school production. Yes  the movie was low budget  but it was also low quality.\tTake a look at Terrence Howard's performance in \""Crash \"" and then go see what he does in \""Hustle & Flow.\"" The guy does all the little (and big things) a film actor has to do to be credible. Not only that  he has an absolutely mesmerizing screen presence. If he doesn't become a major superstar  winning accolades and awards along the way -- as opposed to the kind of superstar status of  say  Tom Cruise or one of the other lightweight pretty boys -- then we'll know once and for all that the system is totally gamed.\""Hustle & Flow\""? I went to it the night it opened in NYC  having heard the buzz about it in reviews on NPR and in the NY Times. I was somewhat skeptical  yet I bought my ticket with an open mind  hoping I'd be entertained  enlightened  etc. Maybe what I really wanted was something other than the Big Bucks Production Crap that the major studios turn out so routinely. I wasn't disappointed. Because \""Hustle & Flow\"" didn't overwhelm me with effects. Instead it got me involved in a story about some downtrodden yet ever hopeful characters. Craig Brewer's script crackled with wit  pathos  hope and rage  and his direction was blessed by so much verisimilitude that the part of Memphis he intended to portray became almost visceral on the screen  tiny elements (wisps of smoke from a cigarette  beads of sweat  the oily smudges on an old fan) adding volumes to the back story. Brewer's casting decisions were inspired. Terrence Howard (DJay) will get all the \""star\"" play  but he's got some terrific support in Taryn Manning (Nola)  Taraji P. Henson (Shug)  Paula Jai Parker (Lexus)  Anthony Anderson (Key) and DJ Quails (Shelby). All in all  this is a \""don't miss\"" film. A breakout by its writer/director  star and cast. Will it win big in this year's Hollywood awards shows? Hard to say. It should  in my opinion. One thing is sure... it's infinitely better than the \""5.9\"" rating it's been given up to this point in time. Almost forgot... all hail John Singleton for producing the film! On NPR I heard that he put $3 million of his own cash into getting it done. Let's hope he cashes in big-time...\tI almost walked out of this movie a couple of times but am glad that I stuck it out. This is a cut or two above the blaxploitation flicks of the 1970s and a more realistic portrayal of the black culture  I think  than \""Shaft\"" (I'm white  by the way). I sympathized with D-Jay  the lead character  who wanted to quit pimping and live his dream. Most movie pimps are stereotyped  but D-Jay's character looked at prostitution (the world's oldest profession  we're told) as a means to an end. So  I was disappointed when D-Jay  rather than beat up the man in the electronics store for eyeing his woman suspiciously  lends her out in return for the microphone he wants. The movie heats up when a Memphis native-turned-rap star comes home for July 4 and chills out with his posse at a local club. Clutching a demo tape of his rap tunes  D-Jay gets a meet-and-greet session with the established star  and I dare not reveal more. A movie that easily could have failed succeeds because of the strength  and honesty  of its fine cast. And  the years have been good to Isaac Hayes  whose theme from the original \""Shaft\"" was ground breaking in its day.\tThis movie won the Audience Award at 2005's Sundance Film Festival. Hmmm. Must not have been a strong year. Don't get me wrong. It's a good movie  sometimes great. Pulling from great movies like Pulp Fiction  and others. It's not a documentary  though it could have been  especially with today's reality show craze. For a pimp movie  there was almost NO nudity  nor were there any sexual scenes  which could have made it even better.This movie was more about the music  and it DID have a great soundtrack  in fact  I think I'm going to get it. I don't really like a lot of rap music  but this was powerful stuff  in line with Eminem's 8 Mile.This movie is worth seeing  but don't believe all the hype. Walt D in LV. 7/25/2005.\tAs a member of the Hollywood community  I was blown away by this film... By the tight screenplay  the professional direction  and the phenomenal acting. In my opinion  I think this is one of the best films of the year so far. With that said  it is not a film for children. It is not a film meant to portray ideal role models for children. It IS a film meant to realistically depict the lives of people who live at the very bottom of America's socioeconomic ladder. If you find yourself unable to reserve judgment against people born into a life so vastly different than your own  you will probably not like this film. In order to appreciate it  you have to be able to see past the moral and ethical ambiguities of these characters.So if anyone feels unsure whether they can handle the ugliness of this type of world  but still feels curious enough to see it  take a cue from the Anthropologists... When studying a culture vastly different than your own  make sure to leave the rights and wrongs of your society at home. Because once you impose the moral judgment and ethical standards of your world upon another's  you've sacrificed your objectivity. And by doing so  miss the very point of empathy.\tBetter than 8 mile  as rap movies go. TERRANCE HOWARD  got off!!! This role kinda reminded me of the role TERRANCE  played in the movie  DEAD PRESIDENTS  I have followed his work  and his ability to play different types of characters...good/bad guys  to corporate exec/lawyers  Confirms my thoughts that he is one of the most under rated actors in Hollywood! Paula Jai Parker  is no stranger to playing a street hooker  as she played in the movie PHONE BOOTH  she was very convincing. I just hope she does not get \""locked\""  into these type of roles. It could be damaging to her career! Some females  are gonna have a problem with the female characters in this film  no doubt  But if they can get pass all that  the guts of the film will clearly appear! As we all know  \""PIMP'N AIN'T EASY\""  so let's try the RAP GAME!!\tDecent film that accurately captures how the less than wealthy Memphians scramble  and plot to survive. Of course  most hustlers here think they can rap and most of them can't. I thought Djay was a pretty \""nice guy\"" pimp and his women looked pretty good compared to most of the street hookers around here. Nice knock against folks in this town who make it and then forget where they are from. The store  the neighborhood  and the bar are all for real have a familiar look. The people who populate the film are also pretty realistic. My only beef was that you pretty much knew how it was going to play but at least Craig Brewer is trying to do the 70's tribute without the Tarentino vibe. I loved the beat up car with the nice rims you see that here all the time and yeah that white trash low rent look is all in here.\tCraig Brewer summed it up here:\""For many of us  creative expression and collaboration with others is nothing new. But we must never forget that there are many in this world who've never been asked to express themselves with movement or words or paint.Regardless of our given circumstances  we are all entitled to contribute a verse. It is our right as human beings. A right that belongs to you  to me  and to a country stripper named Tequila.\"" - from Landmark Theatres newsletterHustle & Flow was very much about pimps  tricks  and hoes  about the down-on-their-luck folks and the dreams that often lay dormant...deferred. Langston Hughes once wrote\""What happens to a dream deferred?Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore-- And then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over-- like a syrupy sweet?Maybe it just sags like a heavy load.Or does it explode?\""In Hustle & Flow  DJay ponders this question and soon he discovers the answer and it's not a happy ending. That would have been too Hollywood  to end of the rainbow and not the point. The question  \""What happens to a dream deferred?\"" appears to be answered with nothing but more questions. But take the time to analyze each question and you'll get an idea of what Hughes and DJay really believes about dreams being postponed. The \""dream\"" is a goal in life. Hughes position is clear that any important dream or goal that must be delayed can have serious negative affects. As DJay ponders the question we find out what those affects are. Like Hughes' poem  Hustle & Flow offers a possibility of each negative affect. The dream or life goal of a human being is central to what makes the human a valuable member of society  but suppose that person with the dream is told he cannot fulfill his goal just yet...it's a cycle of self-fulfilling prophecies.I thought that the writing in Hustle & Flow was inspiring and the acting well done. I've been to Memphis and other cities like Cleveland  Louisville  St. Louis. I have relatives who are living in the same conditions as what people see on screen. Like DJay they all ponder the question: What happens to a dream deferred? Hustle & Flow shows us that having to postpone one's deepest desires can lead to destruction.\tI do not get blown away like this often  but Hustle & Flow is a perfect piece of cinema. Don't shy away from this one because there are pimps  drugs  hookers  and strippers. Terrence Howard is the soul of Hustle & Flow  and his portrayal of a Memphis pimp who discovers a passion for rapping is Oscar worthy. Every character is dead-on believable and every word spoken is poetry. I don't care if they're being stupid  funny  gritty  sarcastic  or violent  every ounce of this dialogue is delicious.Describing the downside of his job to a prostitute named Nola (Taryn Manning)  Shelby (DJ Qualls)  a vending machine stuffer  says  \""I always smell like sticky buns and Skittles.\"" The hooker replies  \""Wow  and I thought my job sucked.\"" That's just funny! The whole movie  though  isn't so light-hearted. The drama definitely knocks you down  but the music keeps you going. I usually don't even like rap music  but I loved the music in Hustle & Flow because I understand where it comes from  and I care about these characters. In a summer full of uninspiring remakes  this movie reminds me that creativity and brilliance is still alive and well...if not in Hollywood  then at least in Memphis!\tI just saw this flick to a packet house in NYC and the entire audience  myself included was with every frame of this film. Every single beat hits exactly where it is supposed to. Every review I read talks about the music and the acting  but how about how genuinely funny this film is a way that few are?They took the material seriously rather than letting it devolve into schmaltz or comedy. The direction is straight on  no BS  no showy shots. They take their time with each scene.Good story  perfect characters well realized. Witty  crackling dialogue. You can't make this stuff up. And comparing this to 8 mile is like comparing dogshit to gold.A deeply flawed protagonist who is able to reach into himself and transform himself through the power of art  larger themes involve the disillusion with fame  consumer culture.This is everything a film is supposed to be. If it makes you feel good to knock this film  then you are a snob. If you think can make a better movie than this  then go ahead!People who love movies love this film. This is what film is about.\tHave you ever woke up one morning feeling tired and burnt out? Then something dramatic happens in your life and you see the world differently. \""Wow!\"" That is exactly the moral being told here. There is humor  sadness and anger in this film. I cried three times  and yelled at the screen twice. I haven't felt this moved in a movie since Tom Hanks lost Wilson  the soccer ball  in The Castaway.Everyone has to go see this movie regardless of race  age  (18yrs) or gender. I give this movie the highest rating for a director and performer.Thank You  Staci Schacht\tI guess the old saying \""Every dog has its day\"" is true but also perhaps no more in a way than it can be applied to Southern hustlers and pimps. \""Hustle & Flow \"" written and directed by Craig Brewer  is a movie about that one shot. It's about how everybody's got a dream  and they only get one chance to grasp it and hold on to it.From the outset  this could have been a laughable  if not completely stereotypical \""gangsta hustla\"" flick about aimless Memphis layabouts who attempt to brighten their dim outlook on life through hip-hop. In all respects  from the advertisements on television  that's what it appears to be but when you actually see the movie in action  a whole new dimension is revealed.\""Hustle & Flow\"" flows through its story the same way most \""dream\"" movies do but somewhere in there  we get a genuine feel for the characters and their motivations  and an especially profound performance from lead actor Terrence Dashon Howard as DJay  a Southern hustler who suddenly finds himself writing rhymes almost every minute of the day.As I write this  I'm still humming the words in my head (\""Whoop that trick! Whoop that trick!\""). Of course with those words  come sounds and with the sounds come images  powerful ones. The makings of a truly good rap song  in my view  originate in deep meaningful words that are written from the heart  and that's how DJay's lyrics flow. (I'm aware his lyrics are hardly inspiring  but you get the idea.)As the Southern hustler/pimp in a mid-life crisis  the mode is turned on for DJay when a junkie sells him one of those old Casio electronic keyboards. He toys around with it for a little bit  as he remembers that he had one himself when he was little boy but soon a light switches on  and DJay is tossing around lyrics like a football.He presents his ideas to an old high school buddy  Clyde a.k.a. \""Key\"" (Anthony Anderson  in a nice turn-around role from his usual comedic antics)  who currently records demos for his church. When DJay first pitches his plan to him  Key is discreet  \""A lot of people talk the talk  but don't walk the walk \"" as he at first believes he's not serious. Key's wife Yevette (Elise Neal) isn't especially happy by this sudden turn of events for her husband but he's profoundly touched  as is DJay  by the sound  and the two are quickly chanting \""Whoop that trick!\"" like it's the Gospels  but Yevette is at least supportive enough to remind them that even they have to eat dinner.Meanwhile  DJay must also contend with the worrisome troubles of his current reality  from live-in stripper Lexus (Paula Jai Parker) and her baby son  both of whom he eventually throws out of the house  to his pregnant ('ho  or main girlfriend? I'm not sure) Shug (Taraji P. Henson)  who eventually sings the chorus of his demo  and Nola (Taryn Manning)  who also aspires to do something else with her life. Together  with Clyde and white boy disc jockey Shelby (DJ Qualls)  everybody  in a fashion much like a family  begin recording demos left and right with a makeshift studio in DJay's house.\""Hustle & Flow\"" is pleasantly surprising in a way that a lot of black-themed movies aren't anymore. It has a genuine spirit that's carried on the shoulders of its lead performer  Terrence Dashon Howard  who speaks with that unique Southern hustler drawl and slang that makes his character all the more realistic and believable. He's simply brilliant in this role  as I've heard he's no stranger to music himself and his lyrics in this film seem so inspired you'd think he has a shot at a career as a rap star.What all of their hard work eventually culminates in  of course  is a chance meeting with a rapper from Memphis who managed to blow up and is featured prominently on television and such; his name is Skinny Black (real-life rapper Ludicrous)  who DJay insists he attended school with. DJay sees the opportunity on July 4th to slide Skinny Black his demo tape and have him put the thing on the radio.\""Hustle & Flow\"" ends on a note of deep profundity. Does DJay blow up and become the huge star he wants to be? I won't tell  but the movie ends in such a way you'd think it was true about people with dreams. Key says that life doesn't always pan out the way it should for some people  but that also  sometimes  it does. The thing about it is  he's right.Note: As a fan of rap  it is true what Shelby says about how much of popular music arose from or originated in the South (in addition to a lot of good rappers)  from Arrested Development  to Outkast  to the Geto Boys  to Ludicrous himself (whom I'm no big fan of).Note #2: Yes  I'm aware that \""Ludicrous\"" is typed correctly; it gets auto-corrected by IMDb for some reason so please just ignore the spelling.8/10\tI saw the preview of this movie a couple of weeks ago and loved it. You can't help but feel sympathy for DJay. This movie shows you that in a split second your whole life can change  and most of the time in a bad way. Terrence Howard is absolutely powerful in this role. As much as I hated his character in Crash  I felt so sorry for this character (DJay) he played so well. I laughed  cried and wondered silently to myself  how many people live like this. Sometimes just having a dream is not enough.I hope this movie gives Terrence Howard the recognition he so deserves. I have been rooting for him for a while now and hope that this will be his breakthrough.\tHustle & Flow (2005) **** (/4) Starring Terrence Howard & DJ Qualls Sublime cult drama focusing on the relationship between two rent boys in Memphis  Tenn  USA. Howard (in career-best form) plays DJay  a narcoleptic  quiet homosexual searching for his mother and for some kind of meaning. Qualls (inevitably overshadowed by his outrageously talented co-star) is Shelby  the son of the Mayor  slumming it as a hustler.Despite its flaws: a few lines that miss the mark  the ill-advised  poorly executed diversion into Henry IV territory  and the distracting appearance of Richert which accompanies it  it remains one of the key films of the 21st century.Well-acted and scripted and brilliantly directed (with fine use of color  recurring motifs and bold credits)  Hustle possesses a rare  dream-like quality. The music too is excellent  particularly in the perfect first and final scenes: you'll never listen to The Pogues' 'The Old Main Drag' without thinking of this movie and of its central figure: of Howard appearing from the left of the frame with only a black bag and a stopwatch... of the fireside scene  and of the final line: \""This road will never end. It probably goes all... around... the world...\"" Added to that  it's funnier than most comedies (Terrence's simple \""Thanks\"" when his pleading with a fat naked man named Walt finally gets him 10 more dollars  the sight of him hurdling fences as Reeves tells a policeman: \""I guess he doesn't like cops\""  and the superb dialogue by the fire: \""So  you didn't have a normal dog?\"")  and exists as one of the most honest and moving depictions of love ever seen on the screen. Having said that  of course  it remains a film that polarizes audiences: it will either go straight into your Top 10 or your dustbin after you've finished it; and most reviewers acknowledged this  giving it middling reviews: \""**1/2: Many potent scenes... Howard is excellent. Cult status is assured\"". Even so  you simply must see it  to decide where you stand. Whether you love it or despise it  you will never  EVER forget it.Needless to say I stand in the former camp: I've seen about 800 movies from the '20s to the present day and this is my favorite: tremendously haunting and affecting and endlessly quotable (though few great films are): it simply works on ever level.One final note: Some people criticize this movie for being very similar to Gus Van Zant's my own private Idaho. I personally don't see that as a bad thing. It is like criticizing a man for being \""handsome.\""\tI recently viewed this film and the moment I walked out of the theater  I made phone calls to inform other friends and family that they should see this film  ToDAY(opening). I was amazed(not shocked because he is an excellent actor) at Terrence performance. I could really feel his spirit as he brought this character to life. The supporting cast was excellent as well. Taraji P. Henson  Paula Jai Parker  and Taryn Manning. There were some excellent scenes between all three. This film reminds me of the origins of blues  the true blues. Although its coming from a pimp and his so called \""hoes\"" it is his blues and his struggle. Very real to life. Of coarse some will look down upon this film because it deals with a pimp and his hoes  but this is the most real to life experience I've ever seen in the media about this lifestyle. This film showed the rawness of it all  that it was not \""bling bling and slap a hoe\"". I suggest you check out this film  you wont be disappointed."""
Kung Fu Hustle (2004),"The last few years have seen many excellent Chinese movies ranging from historical dramas  as in The Emperor and the Assassin  to brilliant action movies  Hero  House of Flying Daggers  comedies like Shaolin Soccer  thrillers like infernal affairs and more.Kung Fu Hustle is the next step of what I consider the growing up of the Chinese Film Industry. Gong Fu is an action film full of some of the finest martial arts you can find. But it does not stop there. Latest cgi and cinematic effects are deployed with ease to make the experience truly magnificent. This part could describe a well made but typical Hollywood action production. But Gong Fu grows beyond that  incorporating very satirical elements that make this movie a treat. If you are a fan of Kung Fu movies or if you are a critic  this film can entice both as it presents a delectable parody of the genre without taking itself too seriously. In so far it accomplishes what Hollywood has lost somewhere along the way  the ability to make a funny and inventive movie that is filled with little thoughtful vignettes to discover while still appealing to a broad public.There are scenes  which are so overdrawn that they become surreal  moments when you can not believe what is happening on screen. Typical clich\u00e9s like bad synchronization so common in past Chinese movies are delightfully played upon. In parts of the movie I was even reminded of scenes from Dragonball Z and other anime. But underneath it all Gong Fu does not hide its social critique and puts the finger on several points that might hurt if you think about them.Overall this is a movie for nearly everyone  providing gags and entertainment  if you just want to relax  and little hints and thoughts to contemplate  if you are of the thoughtful persuasion. In my opinion it is one of this years top movies. Recommended!!!\tGong Fu / Kung Fu Hustle is a comedy action movie made out of different genres like western  martial arts and slapstick and mixed together in an amusing mix. Genres are imitated  genres are spoofed. It takes on a simple film clich\u00e9 and takes a twist on it. That's where all the fun comes from here. And from the many reference to other movies.The action scenes are great as they are choreographed by Woo-ping Yuen from The Matrix. We have adequate fight scenes  but Chow even makes some fun of the seriousness of these.Of course this is all form and no substance except for the mild social criticism. But it is still delightful entertainment. If just all movies that try to entertain in a simple way would be like this.\tIts somewhat difficult to regard this film as a black comedy so to speak since the humor is far too light and abundant  however in it (very little) are some rather serious and touching moments. Steven Chow does a fine job of directing and manages to make this hodgepodge of \Looney tunes\"" humor  added with a touch of Tarantino and \""Matrix\"" work. In addition he plays the part as Sing   the ne'er-do-well who finds his calling but Wah Yuen and Qiu Yuen steal the show. The action and laughs are aplenty. Disregard the film's defiance for the law of physics  just sit back and enjoy what may be one of our finest in quite some time.Truly a gem. How I wish it would have found its audience.\tHilarious plot! I really dig Stephen Chow's sense of humor. This movie has Matrix's special effects but with lot more funny scenes. It might appear a little stupid if you are new to Stephen Chow's style. But no worries  once you get a hang of his dark humor  you will really enjoy it. After all  he is ranked way up there in Hong Kong entertainment arena along with Jackie Chen and Jet Li as far as popularity and gross income are concerned. I enjoyed this movie a lot more than \""House of Flying Daggers\""  which is a little confusing  and characters' motives are unclear. This movie however makes everybody's intentions every clear. It just makes you anxious to find out who is gonna kick whose ass in the end. I also like the love story briefly intertwined with the action scenes. The quick flashback of Stephen Chow's character wins you on his side at early stage of the movie  so that you like his character despite of all the bad things he does. It especially makes you feel good when you see him kicking someone else's ass for a change. In conclusion  I love the movie. I guess I better clean up my DVD shelf and find a spot for a new member of my collections.\tIts a whole new set  a whole new look at a movie  a whole new genre...i don't think its action  adventure or comedy. No  it has its own genre.And damn did i liked it :) 10! Superior! No More To Say! If u like Jackie chan  Jet li and u expect that this is the same kind of movie  you're wrong.It contains everything that u wouldn't expect  in the beginning you would think  damn what a strange movie and you will laugh at the scenes. But at the end it will make you think like \""What a master-piece!\""\tKung Fu movies are inherently ridiculous with their balletic indulgences. This movie exploits that constant over the top action with slapstick and Looney Tunes gags. I laughed out loud during the husband beating  the inept knife throwing  the Road Runner chase  and the Pinball battle scenes. Everybody knows some Kung Fu from the frumpy landlady and her wussy man to \""The Beast \"" who looks more like a Florida resident than a Master. But like all great comedies  this movie pays tribute to the same movies it jabs at. The fight scenes in this movie are better than any American knockoff. The special effects and sound effects are quite good  because action needs sound and those stylish snapping noises are here whenever anyone is hit. This belongs in the same class as The Princess Bride and Shaun Of The Dead.\tStephen Chow demonstrates once again that he's the master of the Kung Fu comedy flick. I haven't been this entertained in a movie theatre since the last time I sat in the back row.Not content to use any basic choreographers  Stephen receives help from the legendary Sammo Hung and Wu Ping Yuen. These two experts of the genre deliver the finest martial arts fight scenes I've seen from any movie. Stephen enhances their choreography with astounding special effects and beautiful camera angles. The wire acting is flawless and blends seamlessly with the CGI.But this isn't just a boring action flick! The script is chock full of sight gags and slapstick. Even the action comes with a side-serving of humour. The characters are over-the-top parodies of Kung Fu stereotypes - the bumbling fool  the evil villain  the mysterious assassin  the serene master - and are played to perfection by the cast. This movie is pure entertainment from beginning to end. Hollywood should start paying attention - THIS is what movies are all about.\tWhen I bought this movie  I was expecting a chuckle or two and to see some pretty good fight scenes. This movie went beyond my expectations and has to be one of the best movies I have seen all year. The comedy had me laughing out loud  the fight scenes were jaw dropping and to top it all off it even had some touching emotional scenes as well. This movie has it all and it comes not from the United States  but rather the far east where they seem to keep making movies that I thoroughly enjoy. This movie has a gang known as the Axe gang terrorizing nearly every corner of the city save for the areas that are poor. That is until an aspiring man who wishes to join the gang literally brings the gang violence to this peaceful little slum town with its many colorful characters  which a few of the residents are kind of well versed in kung fu. We get to see this young man make several stupid mistakes and he seems sort of a klutz  but there also seems to be a hint of greater things. Assassines are sent to deal with those who fought the Axe gang and we get a very strange musical combo and a man who is so well versed in martial arts he is known as the \""Beast\"". Great fights ensue  but as for the comedy the best part has to be Sing's (the man who wants to join the Axe gang) assassination attempt of the landlady of the poor town. So if you like Asian cinema and are in the mood for a movie that basically has a lot of laughs and action then this is definitely the one to check out.\tI was not impressed at all by this movie. It was presented as being comic and full of bizarre fighting action. I guess you have to be a real fan of this genre to enjoy this movie. I bored myself to death in the cinema. The humor is very childish  the characters are blunt and irritating. The plot and/or story are of no relevance at all. It's all about the fighting moves. I cannot say if the're good or not because I don't often go to this kind of movie and after watching this one  I'll doubt if I'm going again. Don't get me wrong  I'm a big fan of the Jackie Chan movies. The fighting scenes are much more comic and Jacky has a well-ordened  well-meanured character\tI'm Bill Springer  and heres my final thoughtI wanted to see this in the theaters like really bad  but i'm poor in the fact this economy sucks and my parents hate me enough to not give a crap about me seeking entertainment at the cost of 8.50. Soooo long story short  i'm raking in the cash now  and i bought the DVD.Alright  my expectations were greatly exceeded  It is a perfect mesh of kung fu  comedy  and it even threw in a back story or two(a purpose  which is always good.) Just imagine this  Dragonball Z(minus the the shiny Kamehameha's ) mixed with and gang related movie  wrapped in a Loony Tunesque shell thingy. Its worth the buy  if your into the whole being entertained thing  I know who in the world would want to be entertained(sarcasm.) Now go to sleep. right now  or i'm taking away your toys and giving them to the boogyman in your closet  sweet dreams.\tKung Fu Hustle  is a Chinese film in Cantonese and Mandarin with English subtitles. The film is set in the 1930's in China  and is about Sing  a young man who tried to be good as a child and got bullied and now decides that he wants to be bad and wants to join the evil Axe Gang  that his terrorizing an alley housing complex and killing many of the residents. The Axe Gang  finds out that the landlady and the landlord both are great martial arts fighters and they plan on protecting their housing territory so they get a legendary martial arts fighter as well named The Beast  to kill them. In the end Sing  has to decide whether or not he wants to be good or bad. The film blends action  comedy and even romance together while using cartoon like martial arts moves. Winner of The Hong Kong Film Award for Best Action Choreography  Best Editing  Best Picture  Best Sound Effects  Best Supporting Actor (Wah Yuen  who plays the landlord) and Best Visual Effects at The Hong Kong Film Awards and The HKFCS Award for Film Of Merit at The Hong Kong Film Critics Society Awards. Kung Fu Hustle  has good direction  a good script  good comedic performances by everyone involved  good original music  good cinematography  good film editing  good production design  good art direction  good set decoration and good martial arts choreography and visual effects. Kung Fu Hustle  blends together action  comedy and romance and it all comes together and works very well. The martial arts scenes are like watching classic children's cartoons and the fight scenes (along with the rest of the film) are clever  inspired and very imaginative. The film is also a very good looking film and is nice to look at and the film has an entertaining story and is a lot of fun. The film is like a big popcorn movie but it is made much better than your average popcorn movies and as of this year it was the foreign film with the highest cinematic release in North America. Even though the film has subtitles I think this film will appeal to a lot of people just because it is very fun and entertaining and very creative. One of the most original films of the year and one of the best.\tWow. I was quite surprised by this flick. I was expecting something akin to \""Kung Pow: Enter the Fist\"" or \""Top Secret.\"" The trailer looked a little silly  and I never paid it much attention. It came home on video though  and after watching it we all agreed that we were pleasant surprised. The story unfolded much like some other Asian films  like \""Hero\"" and \""House of Flying Daggers.\"" There was emotional struggle of lost love  and underdog vs. overwhelming force. The special effects were a bit over the top  but I feel they really did fit in well with the overall concept of the plot. Even through all the sadness and anxiety the plot provided  it all did finish up with a solid ending.\tI saw this movie in theaters  and it was the funniest movie I've seen in years. It was extremely well done  and I was quite surprised that the humor translated so well form Chinese to English subtitles. The compositing was masterful  and the kung fu was very entertaining. Overall  this was my top movie of 2004/2005.Unfortunately  the same does not ring true of the recent DVD release. Rife with anticipation  I bought the DVD the day it was released. Sadly enough  it has apparently been re-edited into an inferior version. Several shots were altered or removed completely  and the subtitles were changed into less funny dialogue. It's amazing what a few \""tweaks\"" can do to ruin a great film.If you can find a copy of the theatrical release  I highly recommend it  but if all you can find is the DVD release  don't bother. It's simply not as enjoyable.\t\""Kung-Fu Hustle \"" where to begin. Well  for starters  actor and director Stephen Chow is quickly becoming one of Asia's most beloved screen comedians. At 42  and already a veteran of numerous comedies  Chow finally broke through to American audiences with \""Shaolin Soccer\"" in 2001. Now he brings forth this comedic vehicle  \""Kung-Fu Hustle.\""This movie has it all: slapstick comedy (that's right out of a \""Looney Tunes\"" short)  martial arts  and dazzling spin-kicks and arm-twists that are all courtesy of Yuen Wo Ping (\""The Matrix \"" \""Crouching Tiger  Hidden Dragon\""). In this picture  which is set in 1940s Shanghai  China before the revolution  Chow stars as Sing  an aspiring gangster who wishes to join the notoriously lethal \""Axe Gang.\"" The Axe Gang rules much of the city's underground with an iron fist and their demands are absolute. But the accident-prone Sing and his chubby companion (played by Chi Chung Lam) wander into Pig Sty Alley  posing as Axe Gang members. The Axe Gang doesn't bother with this slum very much because it's so poor and plus  it's already under the tyranny of the vicious chain-smoking Landlady (Qiu Yuen)  who runs things along with her husband Landlord (Wah Yuen).Things become complicated when the real Axe Gang shows up  and the Gang is attacked by a trio of kung-fu masters who had been living there. The Axe Gang members are quickly defeated in the ensuing chaos while Sing and his companion are captured by the fleeing gangsters. The two are allowed to join  but are demanded a deed of loyalty - kill someone. For the next 45 minutes or so  Chow is off the screen  and we focus mostly on the tenants of Pig Sty Alley  as the kung-fu masters square off in dazzling skirmishes with Axe Gang acolytes  who are masters themselves. Landlady and Landlord are also later revealed to be masters too.Chow reenters the picture and remains on the screen until the closing credits  where he  donning a white outfit a la Bruce Lee himself  takes on the remaining gangsters in a free-for-all reminiscent of the \""Crazy 88's\"" scene from \""Kill Bill.\"" As it turns out  he is a kung-fu genius  in that he's had the power to master martial arts since birth (I must say Chow does display some impressive moves of his own). He then does battle  in the film's most over-the-top sequence  with The Beast (Hsiao Liang)  who is the most feared kung-fu master of them all.This is a brilliant action-comedy from a mind that seemed destined to bring forth something like this to the masses. The film plays out a lot like a collision between every great martial arts movie we've ever seen and then adds a heavy dose of slapstick and Chow's sly wit. You'll laugh at Chow's comedic antics  as every great kung-fu flick gets its fair share of comedy. It's just kind of funny  since I was watching \""Enter the Dragon\"" (1973) last night  which is considered the greatest martial arts movie ever  and then today I watch \""Kung-Fu Hustle \"" which could be called one of the greatest parodies of the genre.Though some of the humor might be lost on American audiences  I found myself laughing quite a bit. It definitely caught on to me as Chow also pays sly homage to his heroes  both Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan  who made the genres Chow pays respect to. It's all done in a deliriously comic fashion that also doubles as a visual feast for the eyes. The film also contains a rather touching subplot with a mute girl Sing once saved from bullies  and it really got to me because of the cheesy music that cues up whenever they are on the screen together.\""Kung-Fu Hustle\"" is one of the best pictures I've seen this year so far. I expect we'll see a lot more of these types of pictures that are going to be cherished by a devoted following in the future. Stephen Chow has crafted a funny  brash  and action-packed picture that's sure to remain with the masses in the coming years.10/10\tAre you bored? Do you live a boring life? Do you want something different in your life? I recommend this: go to the movies. Oh  don't fret  I know that lately the movies have been nothing more than a lot of disappointments  mind numbing horror flicks  and romantic comedies starring grade A actors. Of course if you live a boring life  that means you do not have that significant other as of now. Don't fret. Watch Kung Fu Hustle. Yes  I know  it looks totally weird  different  and stupid. But there is one sure thing; this is one of the most entertaining movies in a very long time. You do not need to actually think much  but just sit there and be blown away by the visuals  laugh your butt off at the physical comedy  admire the jaw-dropping fight scenes  and also get teary-eyed at the sentimental scenes. Kung Fu Hustle is 95 minutes of fast-paced in-your-face action that leaves you with a smile on your face throughout the entire film.From the first scene to the last  you will be seeing things that you do not see in regular films. For starters the beginning of the movie features a dance sequence involving a gang of professionally dressed axe-carrying assassins. Kung Fu Hustle is about a wannabe gangster trying to join the \""Axe Gang \"" while the Axe Gang is having trouble with the strong citizens of a certain deserted area outside the city. Throughout the film you see the main character try whatever to join the gang  and you will see the gang go to extraordinary lengths to teach the landlady and the landlady's husband a lesson. What makes this movie so great is that the movie combines good old-school kung fu action with excellent visual and special effects  and also a few action and chase sequences that look like they were ripped off of old Warner Brothers cartoons. The plot is very simple and easy to follow  but it will be all the chaos that will lure you into the film.Fighting. More fighting. Countless fighting. It is all there. Whether it is one man against an entire gang  a few citizens against blind assassins wielding a deadly musical instrument  an insane man against a powerful couple  a very loud lady against her husband  or an old-fashioned brawl amongst the citizens just for the sake of fighting  Kung Fu Hustle will deliver so much action  it parallels the action-packed Kill Bill (Volumes 1 AND 2). And then there are the Looney Tunes-style scenes. The visuals shine during these scenes  especially the chase between the landlady and the main character (Sing  played by the director/writer of the film  Stephen Chow). Mostly the cartoonish action is for humorous moments  but at other times the style of fighting also became serious  at one point it even resembled Dragonball Z  the infamous anime that stretched a plot to incredible lengths (20+ episodes it took just to show one fight).With most good all-around films  you also get your sentimental moments as well. With this film  there is this sad scene with Sing and his bitter past and how it shapes up his personality. There are other moments but I'd rather not spoil them for you. The acting is not the world's greatest  but like most action-packed films  it is not necessary as long as there is enough going on to keep you on your feet. There is a lot of slapstick and physical humor that makes up for the lack of jokes involving dialogue; so if you are the kind that does not laugh at a typical businessman beating down two wanna-be assassins or a guy throwing a knife at a woman  only to have it bounce back and stab him  then you are not going to find this movie as funny as other people would.Bottom Line: One of the best films in a very long time. Very well directed  plenty of effort was put into this  and it pays off. Plenty of action  comedy  and also with a dab of good music and drama fills the bill as the 95 minutes watching this is much better than just watching the typical two-hour movie. I had a lot of fun watching this  reminds me of the old days when I would watch cartoons that have no plot whatsoever but did not matter because they were just fun to watch over and over again. Surely this film will not get the box office success that it deserves  because it is too goofy for people  and some teenagers (and adults) will fear that their ego will be tainted if they are caught watching this. Come on everyone  watch this foreign masterpiece and do the hustle! Score: 10/10\tWorst film of all time (and I include Solaris in that). I can't see how anyone could possibly like this film! Oh I occasionally laughed but that was generally in sheer shock at how I let my friends drag me to see it. The plot made no sense  nuns are funnier and bluntly it was just stupid. I would like someone to really explain to me why they liked it  I cannot be persuaded I assure you but it would be interesting to hear their reasons. Personally I would advise anyone who has been unfortunate to buy the DVD to burn it immediately and bury the ashes so future generations will never have the misfortune to witness it.\tThis movie is now my favourite movie of all time. What a great movie! It doesn't happen very often that a movie makes me feel this way. For a long time I had three favourite movies which were fight club  requiem for a dream andmomento. Now Kung Fu Hustle has stolen that title! This movie has everything in it  great humor  action and a little bit of love thrown in for good measure. I was laughing so hard at the knife scene my eyes were watering!! Ill admit it started a little bit slow but then it definitely turned it up a notch and never looked back. Id like to thank Stephen chow for making such a great film! A+++++++++ Have you ever killed anyone before? I've always thought about it.\tMy best friend said  when I told him I'd seen this film  \""Wasn't it written by Italo Calvino?\"" That's one of the best descriptions I can think of for how deeply imaginative  sly  and intellectually hep \""Kung Fu Hustle\"" really is. I'm not usually the action flick kind. In the same night I also rented \""The Farewell \"" a German film about the last days of Bertolt Brecht. That's more my typical fare: the quiet European character study of a great artist and the women who love him. I twiddled my thumbs through it after having seen Chow's mind-bending visual insights. Aside from the sincerity of the story--its good guy thinks he's a bad guy but becomes the best guy/hero theme--\""Hustle\"" is a non-stop feast of turned tables  of the literal and figurative varieties. This is a wild and crazy action flick for people who don't like wild and crazy action flicks.\tThis movie is a highly creative and stylized action film from the Hong Kong kung fu genre.A lot of wit  slapstick  visual effects  killer kung fu  and a unique plot offer an incredibly fun and entertaining film. Wonderful acting and directing has elevated this film to a level  on par with with other unique and innovative films like Crouching Tiger or The Matrix.At one time I hated all kung fu movies (like most  I could only tolerate Bruce Lee and couldn't understand goofy HK kung fu cinema.) Thanks to films like this  I now look forward to edgy modern kung fu movies. Two thumbs up!\tOnly my reluctance to give anything a perfect ten out of ten stops me from rating this film ten. What an absolutely awesome flick! I just saw it with my husband and I can't think when I last saw a movie I enjoyed this much. It had the whole package - style  innovation  solid (and often sympathetic) characterisation  romance  martial arts  good guys  bad guys  comedy  great cinematography  pathos... Go see it now! God  I loved this movie. I thought hard trying to come up with a single criticism and this is the best I can do - on occasions the incongruous sound effects are more distracting than effective. That's it. There's nothing else wrong with this movie!"""
Land of the Dead (2005),"i think George let himself down of this one i was looking forward to seeing land of the dead after loving the 3 original zombie flicks i think George should of taken more time and listen to the fans of the movies to see how they wanted this one to be its hardly zombie vs human its more human vs human i say bring on the remakes day of the dead is up next due for 2006 and if dawn of the dead is anything to go by this will be the movie that brings back zombie movies. I'm a huge zombie fan but nothing beats the classics and resident evil milla jovavich as an ass kicking bio weapon just does it for me if your gonna see land of the dead i suggest you don't get to to excited the let down will be too hard to bear\tLand of the Dead (2005) is the fourth film in the \Dead\"" series. Taking place around the time of the third film  many of the living humans have taken refuge inside a walled city. The city's guardian is an armor plated land moving called \""Dead Reckoning\"". Inside the city the people are divided by \""The Haves\"" (led by Dennis Hopper who over sees the on goings of the civilians and live inside a giant glass tower) \""The Have nots\"" are the people who live outside the tower and make it possible for those inside to maintain the life style they have. The movie follows Riley (Simon Baker) who is one of the scavengers that go out in the night and forage for supplies (food and medicine). Cholo (John Leguizamo) is a scavenger who wants to live in the glass tower. He does whats asked of him and more. When he's denied that privilege  Cholo and his buddies hijack Dead Reckoning and threaten to blow up the tower. Meanwhile Riley just wants to get in a vehicle and leave the city for Canada  But those plans are scrapped when he gets into a fracas whilst trying to save Slack (Asia Argento). Riley  Slack and Riley's friend Charlie are locked up in jail cells. But Cholo is running around in D.R. blackmailing Kaufman for a large sum of money (where's he going to spend it I have no idea). Desperate  Kaufman makes a deal with Riley; bring back D.R. and Cholo and he can leave the city. There's a big problem making matters worse. A zombie nicknamed \""Big Daddy\"" is organizing all of the living dead. They want one thing. Destroy the tower and Kaufman. Along the way to the walled city  Big Daddy gathers more and more zombies forming a massive zombie army. Kaufman doesn't trust Riley so he has three soldiers follow him (possibly betray him as well). Riley eventually recaptures Dead Reckoning but him and Cholo realize that the same factors that protect the walled city can also make it a huge mausoleum. Instead of fleeing  Riley and the others make a break for the city as Big Daddy and Company barge through. A bloody massacre ensues. The people inside the Glass Tower are so oblivious to life on the outside living in total denial. Reality comes crash down of them when Big Daddy and his motley crew of undead riff-raff bringing them misery and sorrow. Kaufman makes a run for it with his manservant. Big Daddy singles him out and makes a bee line for him. His manservant ditches Kaufman leaving him to face his maker alone. Cholo also has some payback he wants to give to him personally as well. Riley arrives to the city a sees the mess that the zombies have made. He decides to leave north with Dead Reckoning when he learns that the survivors will pick up the pieces and just have to face the reality that their are far too many zombies out there and in order to survive they're going to have to learn to live with them. Satisfied; Riley  Slack  Charlie and the Dead Reckoning crew head off north in search of a place where there are no zombies and people like Kaufman who are trying to hang on to a society that is as dead as the dinosaurs.Years in the making have finally paid off for George A.. Romero. His return to the mainstream and his first zombie movie in twenty years is well worth the wait. Romero knows how to write a movie and this one is no exception. The gore is real high for a R-Rated movie and the acting is pretty good. I like to see Dennis Hopper poking fun of people like himself. The social commentary is excellent and highly entertaining. That's what I enjoy about his movies. People have unfairly slagged this movie for no apparent reason. I don't know why  they should stick to more mainstream Hollywood fair like the Resident Evil series. I wouldn't mind the \""Dead\"" series ending here. Romero should continue with the Zombie films but in a different direction. The man knows how to make this genre work!Highly recommended.\tOkay. First off  let me state that I am a big horror film fan  and particularly of films of this genre.That said  this movie failed at achieving both it's goals. The first would be its' attempt at social commentary. Okay.....so here's what this movie is trying to say- the humans  they're America (booo! hiss!). And the zombies  well they're everyone else (awwwwww). So the poor  sweet man-eating zombies would just leave the humans alone  and everyone could live together in harmony if the humans (America) would just cool the f**k out  right?Sure  except A) the zombies would EAT THE HUMANS.B) People in the rest of the world are not zombies....they happen to be humans who are entirely capable of thinking for themselves  and acting in their own interest.....just like Americans do. The \""commentary\"" this film makes is simply an example of a particularly patronizing and superior attitude that many in the west display  writ large.So  I guess this film is brilliant social commentary....if you are in the 3rd grade.On to goal #2. Being a good zombie movie. Ahhhh.... if being a good zombie movie means that you sacrifice all scare factor in the name of \""social commentary\"" (see goal #1) and turn the zombies into poor  downtrodden morons that you are supposed to feel bad for (despite their hunger for your flesh) then this flick is GREAT.Even the \""Dawn\"" remake was better than this pile of crap.\tI am not a big fan of Zombies  even though I have seen all the Romero ones  my friend is big into them  so went with him to see this latest installment  this was supposed to be a sequel or continuation of the movies made in the late seventies early eighties  I thought this might be somewhat interesting then.The biggest thing that got me if this was a continuation of those movies why were the remaining humans using very 21'st century technology? They seem to have access to GPS  and current computer technology  also if I remember right belly rings weren't any kind of fad in the late 70's  and I would seriously doubt that technology would evolve after zombies ruled the Earth no Microsoft or Intel going I expected to see a world frozen in the late 70's  not humans running around using high end tech both me and my friend said that at the same time when leaving the theatre.\tWhile many fans and other viewers seems to have been disappointed by the Land of the Dead  I admire George Romero for not rehashing his earlier films and making a fresh film within the genre. I would imagine that there was a lot of pressure from the financiers to rehash DOTD. Instead  Romero has made a very different movie - a biting satire of today's world - with some good gore thrown in.The movie itself is a little uneven. Sadly  the last third is very hurried - as though it was harshly edited to fit the 90 min time frame. The characters in the movie are also much less edgy and unpredictable than the ones in the earlier movies - and the film is less character-driven and more plot-driven than its predecessors. None of the characters are as memorable as the numerous standouts from the first three movies. Moreover  there are a lot of characters and the plot has a lot of scope so the movie could easily have filled a compelling 120-130 minutes.On the other hand  the plot is much more important this time around and is as good as ever. Romero is commenting on the \""winner takes all\"" nature of todays world and of the post 9/11 world. Some things that I observed are comments on the class system (Fiddler's Green)  the middle class yearning to be included in the upper class and its results(Cholo's fate)  immigration policies (the island and its barbed fences)  the shock and awe campaign(the fireworks  killing of the lawnmower zombie)  the many obvious parallels to the War on Terror (Kaufman  Dead Reckoning)  etc.I really enjoyed watching the film  especially after I got over my subconscious expectations of a rehash. Once I realized that it was a new film and not a remake  I saw the film in a new light. After all  it is very rare to see an American film these days that has any sort of social or political subtext. I sincerely hope Romero has more opportunities to make such films in the future - with or without zombies and odes to red meat.\tIs overrated. Everyone proclaims Romero a master. Ahem. Even his biggest fans admit that the majority of his movies are crap. His Zombie films are by far his best  but are weighed down with social commentary so blatant it feels as if you're slapped in the face with a wet salmon of political justice. Anyway  onto the film.Land of the Dead is a pretty fun little flick  without too much going on to overload your brain. It pales in comparison to the Dawn of the Dead Remake  and even Shaun of the Dead (which admired Romero so much). The action is barely action. There is a lot of movement  but you're never really gripped by it. There are a few clever scares tucked in between fairly lame dialog. The acting isn't bad. Dennis Hopper is awesome as usual  and he owns every frame he is in. The special effects are good and its nice to see zombies on the big screen.Overall this is a decent flick  if you're a fan of the genre I'm sure you'll like it  but if you're not a huge Romero or Zombie fan  you wont really be that excited by it. I'm a huge zombie fan  and this gets a 7.\tLet me start off with saying I am not a hardcore Romero fan.I have seen Night Of The Living Dead and Dawn Of The Dead.I will check out Day Of.. too.I have to say I enjoyed this one.I have friends that have been fans since way back and they were disappointed with it.To me this is a new era and it was nearly 20 years since the last dead movie.I loved that it was more gory and violent than the old ones.The zombies looked better than ever the characters were okay but the action was fun.I don't know what people wanted but this is it.I enjoyed the sense of humor with the political overtones about the current state of the world tied into it.My only beef is the timing with release and its the studios fault.Why are they releasing horror flicks in the summer?They just had Amityville and Boogeyman before this one.To me this should have been a fall/winter release.It was not going to be Star Wars or Fantastic Four.The other thing was making it a bit longer.I usually don't feel that way but it could of been and it would not hurt.Possibly there may be another one coming out depending on the success.If you can see it in the theater  see it.\tWas not massively disappointed. Was not absolutely overawed with this film. However  I didn't get blown away the first time I saw DOTD. It took a couple or so viewings before I realised that it was one of the best films that I had ever seen.LOTD was a good enough film. Far too short (in my opinion) and not enough character study  but it was a good film. Maybe as we're in the 2000s  the shock we felt from gore-ridden zombie films doesn't reach as far as it used to  but I'm happy.He needs to make more  though. No way am I satisifed. To me  LOTD felt like foreplay. The master has given us nowhere near what we need to be satisfied.\tDear Sirs  There may be several story-lines involving zombie science  that the makers of the recent zombie movies overlooked. That is  the 'Zombie-plaque' might be an evolution of STDs  Sexually Transmitted diseases. That is  a group of swingers were the 'patients' zeroes' of the zombie plaque  because they contract various STDs that merged  combined to form a 'pseudo-life' that was hyper-contagious  possibly a combination of the microscopic brain-eating worms that afflict some HIV patients  and bacteria or mold  which was the starter mix of this 'pseudo-life'  when the widely-dispersed swingers contract a common staph infection  and that combined with the other STDs to create the 'zombie plaque'. If so then using silver bullets on zombies could kill them outright  since silver kills staph infection. The heroes could retrieve and recycle the silver bullets repeatedly. Also  Zombies may be hypersensitive to radio waves  so that shooting an army of them with a radar gun or radar gear would make them attack and destroy each other. And  in the course of throwing poison-laced bait to zombies to see if that can 'kill' them  the scientists might discover that feeding zombies arsenic and radioactive Uranium tailings waste with their meat makes them fully intelligent and cognizant  and lessens their all-consuming hunger  so that in a future movie  the Humans and Zombies could co-exist. That covers it. Best Regards  Bob Schreib Jr.\tI'd like to first comment on why i chose to give this film 5/10. The only reason why is because its got a different plot from other movies of this zombie genre  so I give credit for the idea. Other than that  the only other thing i can say about this movie is that there is senseless violence. I don't understand why there was so much weird gore. There was so much unnecessary stuff that kept the movie at a stand still; there was probably about 45 minutes of watching zombies eat and kill humans in really weird ways. In several scenes it shows people being killed in normal zombie like ways  but it would then switch to someone who's belly button piercing is bitten off  someone who gets torn apart and all his internal organs splattered everywhere... and this happened a lot randomly throughout the movie. This movie is only recommended if you are completely drunk! One word to sum it up? Pathetic!!!\tHere is a classic zombie movie  where gore is back in the high seat. I Really liked this movie  not as good as Dawn or Night  but a big improvement over Day. I dug J.L.'s character and basically....no one else. Everyone in this movie I felt was flat  even Dennis Hopper who should have been a delight.The movie felt really short  it could have been a little bit longer  but that is not a complaint. My two main problems with this film were the characters (with J.L. as an exception) and their learning ability. There is one zombie a big black man who doesn't just grrr...or moans like other zombie's  but he screams. They do learn  it's just like Day of the Dead  you'll see zombie's shooting people with guns and using gasoline to blow things up. One character says \""They're trying to be like us  like they use to be. They are trying to live again\"". I found that to be a bit annoying. Another little thing I noticed it the \""main\"" zombie was in the front line but was never shot  it was always the zombies around him that died  I found that to be far fetched.What did I like about it  the whole idea that they live in a new world that they built and they try to live in it  even with zombies everywhere. What's the very first thing you see? A Zombie...none of this how did it happen or character introduction  you get zombies from the beginning. There is a lot of blood  yes there is a lot of CGI blood  which was distracting in a Romero film  but there were at least two very neat deaths that I liked  mostly the throat ripping out through the mouth.I'd say it's a better zombie edition then the ones as of late. Thumbs up Romero  you still have it in ya.Yes  I saw Savini and the two from Shaun of the dead. Which was great because my friend and myself were the only ones in the theater who cheered for them.\tThis movie was the biggest LET DOWN and WASTE of TIME ever... It doesn't even have the same feel as Romero's earlier prequels. I have been waiting for the movie to come out ever since it was announced  having been a fan of his earlier work.I could not believe the incredibly bad storyline  casting  and overall texture of the film. Even the Remake of DAWN of the DEAD destroyed this unholy piece of crap.Although if anyone out there is a fan of Paul WS Anderson's work then they should surely enjoy this video game form of narrative. The teaser for this flick was better than the whole film.\tI read a couple reviews  saw the rating and thought this might be a good film. I loved the original Night of the Living Dead and I'm a Huge zombie flick fan (also have a lot of respect for Romero). However  all i can say about this movie is that it was garbage. There is one line in the film that can sum up just how terrible this movie really is: They are about to shoot zombies that have been destroying the city and eating everyone when the Riley stops them with \""Don't. They're only looking for a place to go. Same as us.\"" It was all dramatic and quiet like we were supposed to feel touched that he was showing compassion for the zombies. Wow  give me a break. Said zombies had just destroyed the last real city on earth! I could go on forever about things wrong with this movie... (how can a zombie get smarter and learn when they don't have a brain? they have nowhere to store such information. Why did the zombies seem to get less stiff as the movie went on? They're still just as dead. Why did they leave the top hatch open in the end when they were so careful to close all other doors? Why did you not hear a gunshot to kill that last zombie in the truck? - heh  i guess that would have ruined you thinking it was still alive when it came out the door - ....all these things would have been fine if all he was trying to make was a terrible B-flick where nothing has to be explained or make sense  but that obviously wasn't his intent). Anyway  if you must see this movie  please rent it with a group of people so you don't feel so ripped off when you shell out $15/person at a theatre.\tI had great expectations towards Land of the Dead  but after i saw it i was very disappointed  and i have noticed that everyone on IMDb loves this  what is wrong with you people  it sucks big time  for many reasons: 1: The Zombies are learning things and learns to communicate  what's up with that  thats just to stupid2: The zombies are very poorly made  they are just to stereotype.3: The ending was so bad  an happy ending  you gotta be kidding. The ending in Dawn of the Dead (2002) was great and how a zombie movie should end. 4: The actors were very bad.There's one thing that i like about this  the effects are done well  when the zombies are eating of the people  but that is about what is good about this flick...To Sum up  this movie really stinks\tI like all of George Romero's movies. Well  let me be honest - I love all of Romero's movies. I am the only 20 year old female that I know of that is absolutely obsessed with zombie movies  and - as we all know - Romero is the king of that genre.And though I thoroughly enjoyed Land of the Dead  I can't honestly tell y'all that it's his best work. This is the first time that Romero has worked with a big studio  Universal  instead of independently  and it shows.Though Land of the Dead has all the Romero jokes and gore  it is a Hollywood movie. It is not his best work. I wouldn't even consider it his second best work  but I still loved it  as it is the only Romero film to be released in theatres during my lifetime  and it may stay that way. He may never make a fifth \""Dead\"" movie  because no one was really sure he was going to make a fourth one until last year.If the movie is still playing anywhere near you  I do recommend seeing it  but I personally cannot wait for a \""Director's Cut\"" DVD. I hope one comes soon.Stay scared!\tI dunno. Maybe it's just me. Maybe it's just the way my brain is built. Possibly there's a fear neuron in there that just doesn't fire up when it's supposed to  because I didn't find this movie in the least bit thrilling.It was fun  don't get me wrong. Plus the game of \""spot the blatantly obvious social commentary\"" was delightful in its own way. However it just missed excitement. The 'va-va-voom' factor it needed to have it settle in my mind afterwards and consider the implications of being a survivor in such a world and what one would have to do to maintain ones heartbeat.I always thought horror was about the fear of the unknown. The terror of what might happen next  just around the corner. What lays beyond the closed door. Real horror plays with your mind. Ones imagination can create the most frightening scenes of all  something no filmmaker could ever visualize on screen. It leaves one wondering whether they would possess the qualities to survive in the same situation?\"". The climax can lift you or leave you thinking all is lost.This will sound heretical to many dedicated zombie movie lovers  but I liked the recent remake of Dawn Of The Dead more than this film. I'm not comparing the remake with the original because I've not seen the original  nor the other two. I'm comparing it purely on the basis of which universe I found the more frightening to spend a 2 hour visit in.The scenes of the Zombies invading the Fiddlers Green shopping mall were actually rather laughable. These don't just walk  they shuffle  slowly. It looked to me like the doomed inhabitants just sat where they were until the zombies were within 3 feet of them then chose to scream & attempt an escape. I mean really? Where's the challenge here folks? They only attacked from one end of the mall. I didn't see any sort of battle plan flanking manouevre enacted in order to obtain maximum kill.It's been stated my many huge Romero fans that zombies don't run like they did in the Dawn remake  but which one was more frightening? The ones who could sight you then chase you down with the intent single minded purpose of ripping your throat out with its teeth? Or the ones you can ride your motorcycle in circles around while it waves it's hands in the air grunting? I'm sorry  but the realisation that I might not outrun my pursuer and knowing what lay in store for me  that's terrifying.In fact  those who complained about \""the running zombies\"" are strangely quiet in their criticism of \""the thinking zombies\""? Wonder why? Is Romero the only guy in the world permittted to reimagine or evolve the zombie genre?The Dawn remake has far less gore than this film. But it makes far better use of darkness & shadows. Of tight spaces  it's sense of claustrophobia. For the Dawn survivors their whole world is now in the shopping mall. Outside  for all they know  there is nothing. They are the last remnants of the civillisation they know  an island outpost in an ocean of the walking dead. That's scary. That's far more terrifying. No one wants to be the last left alive.This film has gore galore  but it's the sort that makes you slightly wince rather than want to throw the contains of your stomach onto the head of the person sitting in front of you. It's 'FUN' gore  if it can be coined in that sense I suppose. Gore itself maketh not the terror. It just serves to separate the zombies from their previous humanity for the viewing audience more so.Without the desire to consume flesh all they are are just itinerants with no sense of hope or need. The most frightening people in this world of ours are the ones who look just like us. The most normal looking people in the world. In that sense Dennis Hoppers character was more frightening than any of the undead. In fact  in this film  it was hard to choose which were worse  the Living or the Dead?One little question? Does eating the living supply the Dead with the necessary nutrients  energy & calorie intake needed to continue on? If not  then one might assume that eventually the dead  given that they are dead  would continue decomposing until presumably they would not be in a state to consume  let alone chase  anyone and would therefore be in a sense their own eradication plan.I've only ever seen this possibility assumed once in the film 28 Days Later (a film I consider a almost complete plot/storyline steal of The Day Of The Triffids. Think about it).One would then assume that given this movie takes place a considerable amount of time after the original outbreak  that without a steady and almost continual supply of food the zombie population would be practically extinct 10 years later  or considerably thinned anyway. This film made no mention of the fact the zombies had started growing market gardens or were even raiding the supermarkets to supplement their diets during the long periods between arm-chomping.Like I stated  it was a fun film. But the last scene at the boat wharf in Dawn and watching the video camera continuing to record was more depressing/fear inducing than anything in this movie. What I will do now is watch the original Dawn on DVD so I can more fairly compare the remake. That should really enlighten me as to whether Romero contains the attributed genius he has been so feted with.\tThis film  which apparently is the conclusion to The \""... of the dead\"" series  is so unbelievably bad that words really don't fit it. I attended the NZ premier at the Auckland international Film festival  and had the \""privelidge\"" of sitting next to a woman who has obviously never EVER seen a horror film before. She jumped at the slightest thing and kept her hands over her eyes. which would be acceptable  if this was a horror film. But its not  its once again a massive crap failure of the studio system taking what could have been a great idea and making a crap film.Lets start at  In the not too distant future... OK  so zombies have been around for a coupla years now  fairenough. You think that people would know that they were kinda dangerous and therefore wear some kind of body Armour  but nope. This is the fundamental thing that makes this movie stupid. The people wonder around in jeans and a shirt and complain when they get bitten!! come on!Oh and the end is a real cracker display of American ignorance! The crew of the zombie mashing truck use fireworks to distract zombies so they can take food and such from stores... In the end they decide to go to Canada and proceed to fire off all the rockets... wait  isn't Canada directly connected to the states? so wouldn't there not be zombies in Canada? NICE ONE HollywoodI don't even have time to go to work on the script and the acting  though someone should be shot for it.So in conclusion : See this movie if A: You love blood B: You can not think for yourself c: your girlfriend is a retard and gets scared real easy\tThe fourth installment in Romero's \""Dead\"" series arrives and it's drab and instantly forgettable. The filmmaker has a bigger budget and a major studio (Universal) at his disposal  but none of that makes any difference to the final result. In fact  as a studio director  Romero sucks. Remember THE DARK HALF? That was his last big studio production.Despite the fact that Romero does pepper his narratives with social comment  there is nothing of interest here. The zombies are being kept from invading a walled city built by rich nutjob Dennis Hopper. A private army cruises the streets in a fancy armored vehicle called \""Dead Reckoning\"" (one of the film's original titles  by the way) and blasts the living dead to kingdom come. The vehicle's creator  Simon Baker  wants to pilfer the vehicle from the urban terrorist who's taken it and head to Canada (where the film was shot) with it. This limp premise permits Romero to stage endless altercations with the \""stenches\"" (smelly zombies).Baker's character is simply irritating. He's the kind of hero who slips a pearl of wisdom into everything he says. Even a simple three word reply to another character's dumb question has a philosophical subtext. Tom Savini  the effects maestro of the previous two \""Dead\"" pics  cameos as a zombie swinging a machete. Dennis Hopper says his lines and collects his cheque and the KNB effects boys do what's expected and do it well.The main problem with the film is the familiarity of its genre elements. It looks like a rip-off of  ironically  of Romero's own films. Romero's obsession with one-dimensional military types continues and robs the story of any emotional pay-off. Baker's semi-stupid sidekick serves as an obvious on-screen narrator and occasional mouthpiece of redundant exposition.This is not the Romero of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD  the brilliant MARTIN or the downbeat THE CRAZIES. It is the Romero who made the terrible BRUISER.\tI hated this movie. Call me old fashioned  but it had none of the charm and brilliance of Night of the Living Dead  Dawn of the Dead  or the Crazies. I don't even think this was a horror movie. It was more like a bad Arnold Schwartzennegar action flick with cheesy dialouge. Sure  it may have had some amusing underlying socialist themes  but the workers and zombies unite thing took itself too seriously. If Romero had made this movie when he still had talent  it might have been a good satirical zombie bloodbath. Instead  I feel like he sold out to the same big budget crap he seems to be against. I wasn't surprised it was bad  given that by the time he made the so-so Day of the Dead  he had totally given up on satire. Night of the Living Dead wasn't satire  but he should admit to himself that he can never make a movie as brilliant or as spooky as that. Romero has lost it  but surprisingly  the remake (of his original) Dawn of the Dead was great. See that instead.\tIt's a bit of an ordeal to read through the user comments on Land of the Dead - they range from every extreme to every other; some say there's too much of this or that  while others claim there's too little of the same things. Oh well.Anyway  I am not a particular fan of zombies or horror  but I am a fan of social commentary  and that's what's interesting about Romero's zombie movies. The high point  as most people agree  was 1978's Dawn of the Dead  in which the zombies symbolized mindless consumers. Since then  not much has changed in society on this account  except that people have become even less aware of social problems - a good example was the 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake  which was sadly cleansed of any social commentary whatsoever.Land of the Dead sees Romero return to the social commentary  and commendably it's quite radical. Here  the zombies have taken on a new symbolism; now they represent the poor masses  the alienated working classes  who  fed up with being reduced to an inhuman existence  finally develop a sense of compassion and solidarity for their fellow zombie (i.e.  on the non-literal level  human being)  and revolts  bringing down decadent capitalism. This is great.I have no problem with the movie not being in proper continuity with the previous movies; this one is its own story  and should "
Last Days (2005),"I would give LAST DAYS 10 if only it were longer--much longer. What about the guys? That's become THE question and will be the question for the next few decades. Gus van Sant knows this and films the question just about better than anyone else. There's Blake  but there's also Luke and Scott--and Luke and Scott together--and we want to know more about them  too. Where are the guys? What are they doing? What are they feeling? How are they feeling? The guys have music  live in it--spirit and body--and that's about all they have these days. And perhaps  more and more  film. Sports and video games--no more. Girls--not enough  any more. Parents? They couldn't care less. Schools? Please! The guys only have each other--Gus van Sant knows that. Blake has neither and that's why he runs out of days  and really still a kid. Luke and Scott at least have each other. This is a brave film. Guys are in-between what they were and what they'll be. van Sant is covering the change. Sad (Blake  inconsolably)  beautiful (any of them)  unclear (think of Luke's glasses)  unsure. But boys--they're still boys--hold the answer to understanding gender  sexuality. I wish the film had gone on and on  there's so much to see about the guys.\tLike Gerry and Elephant  it's beautifully paced and photographed. It echos my thoughts on Gerry that a person could take any frame from the movie  print it  and hang it on the wall. Van Sant's painterly touches still move me after all these years.At times it feels like Van Sant has simply made up his own film-making formula and can now just substitute different characters and locations and ad a sprinkling of plot and story. It's a good thing that it still works brilliantly after these last three films.Although he barely speaks three full  coherent sentences throughout the film  Michael Pitt still brings a performance packed with immediacy and strength to a character who  at this point in his life  has neither.There are three musical sections in the film (four if you count the lingering shot of a TV playing a Boyz 2 Men video)...the first is Blake  apparently on a whim  playing one instrument at a time until each one is layered upon the others  creating this incredibly powerful sonic improvisation. There seems to be no hesitation or deliberation going on  he just creates it  and then it simply vanishes. The second is one of the characters singing along to the brilliant Velvet Underground song \Venus in Furs\"". The last is Pitt's own fantastic song \""From Birth to Death\"". He sits down  grabs a guitar  and opens the floodgates that he has kept shut tight through the entire film. It is here that we see he is not just a burned out \""rock and roll clich\u00e9\""  but that he is brilliant  inspired  and real. Each of these scenes are truly moving...\""From Birth to Death\"" being my favorite; this scene is an instant classic.I was worried that Van Sant would ham-hand Blake's actual death  but I shouldn't have been. It was poetic and touching.If this actually is Van Sant's final film in his 'young and dead' trilogy  it's a great way to end it. While it has touches of humor and levity to it  it feels more subdued than his other films. Unlike the characters in Gerry or Elephant  Blake is a man who has long ago accepted what he is going to do. And with that  he has decided to take one last look around his world and immerse himself physically  even though his head is somewhere else. There is life inside of him that now resides in the spaces between his body and his mind  and is only expressed through his music. It's both tragic and amazing.Cobain's story deserved to be told by a filmmaker like Van Sant  and I'm glad he got to it first. Somewhere  sometime there will be an actual Cobain biopic filled with concerts  parties  and everything else that goes into a rock star movie. And while it could be more exciting and \""true to life\""  it will be Hollywood  and I doubt that it will capture what Van Sant has captured here: the subtle beauty of death  played out like a compassionate  lyrical ballad.\tSunday June 12  6:30pm Neptune Theater - North American PremiereA long lingering reflection of a sad and unpleasant memory was my first impression as the credits rolled on Last Days. There is beauty in the composition but also decay and ugliness in the content. Drawn out vacuous takes extend into tedium that must be intended as contemplation  but Gus is no Tarkovsky. There is a breath of life here and there. Blake's last gasp of inspiration  alone with his music and viewed from the outside with an unflinching stillness as solid as the stones of the house is both mournful and heroic. A far bigger problem is divorcing fact from fiction and the confusing intent of the film itself. Even a made up revisionist biography would be better served reveling in the assent and glory rather than the miserable decline. A film that chronicled the birth of the scene  The Vogue and Sub Pop would be a wonder. Beautiful or not  Last Days is the morose and morbid vision of a dying junkie. I'd sooner recommend Broomfield's documentary than this indulgence. The two minutes of Keaton's The General I saw at the after-party was more entertaining.\tI doubt if on the day in 1994 when Nirvana front man  Kurt Cobain  ended his life with a shotgun to the head  anyone saw his soul rise toward heaven  as Gus Van Sant depicts in \""Last Days \"" his recent foray into the interpretation of cultural phenomena that he also featured in Elephant.As I watched the last days of drugged out \""rock and roll clich\u00e9\"" Blake (Michael Pitt)  patterned after Cobain  I felt Van Sant once again captured the ennui and misdirection of unusual people destined to be famous as he did for the high school assassins in Elephant. Determinism rules: From the opening sequence where he is cleansed by a waterfall to the final heaven-bound image  I never thought Blake could do anything to liberate his spirit other than commit suicide  a state of being in rock and roll all too common  especially for those addicted to heroin.At any rate  Van Sant is not interested in providing rationale or template  just in showing states of psychic turmoil that are inscrutable  such as Coppola did for Kurtz in Apocalypse Now or Herzog for Aguirre in Der Zorn Godes.It is not always fun to sit through the numerous long takes of Blake doing almost nothing but common activities such as making macaroni and cheese. Yet if Van Sant wants us to know why life is not worth living for this lost soul  then he succeeds by showing how isolated and mundane Blake's life actually was at the end. If Van Sant wants to show that great genius has great demands  he succeeds by showing the artist's flawed human nature trying to deal with fame.The big old house where the band is hiding is an apt metaphor for the ragged  decaying  useless band that can't even talk straight. In fact  there is little dialog  which is usually mumbled or so terse as to be negligible. These last days will be my last days watching another icon fall into a non-returnable funk.\tThe film is inspired by Kurt's last days and do not purport to be them. Last Days is a moving film about the toll drugs  fame and false friends can have on an artist. Pitt was amazing. The movie was great. To me this movie is just like real punk music. If you don't like it  if you don't \""get it\"" it just ain't for you  pardner. Van Sant was not making a film for the masses. for you people who need to have every scene  and every shot explained for them. Gus is an artist (with Cowgirls and Psycho being his mistakes). so grow up and see a real movie every once in a while. True auteur film-making is what the world needs not the dukes of Hazzard. \""Monkey see  monkey do... rather be dead than be cool.\""\tOne of the worst Godawful films I've had the displeasure to sit thru; hard to believe this was directed by the same man who made Drugstore Cowboy  My Own Private Idaho & To Die For. A film only appreciated by pseudo intellectual pretentious morons.If one wants to see a good art-house film that depicts the dangers of drug abuse (which Van Sant's film only obliquely & ineptly touches upon) try Requiem for a Dream  which is a film of great merit;contrast that with Van Sant's film  which is totally pointless populated with characters you don't give a damn about.The discerning film buff is having a tough time this year ;either we're inundated with crap from the majors (Fantastic Four)  or art-house garbage such as Van Sant's film. Try catching \""Head-On\"" & \""Downfall\"" two German language films that are among the year's best. They stand out like diamonds in a manure pile against most of the current U.S. releases; is it any wonder with the cinematic crap that we're spoon fed that domestic BO is in such a prolonged slump ?\tcan you tell me what you enjoyed of this movie? before you call me an ignorant moron because i disliked this movie  let me say that i really admired gus van sant doing something different than the other rubbish that have been made recently. but i really really did not like this movie. i know that there was supposed to be no story line and the whole movie was supposed to be watched as a \""fly in the wall\"" perspective  but there was just nothing that made me keep wanting to watch and see what was going to happen. i found many of the scenes quite amusing like when blake was making macaroni and cheese. but overall during the movie  i just couldn't get into the movie or really care about anything that was going on and only to feel more frustrated at scenes that dragged on for way more than they were needed to. so if someone can tell me what was so great about this film  maybe i might reconsider my opinions and give this movie another shot. thanks a lot.\tEverything we experience in life is different for everyone - 2 people can be looking at the exact same flower  for example  and each will be perceiving it entirely differently  based upon a myriad of factors too vast  complicated and profound to go into here. The simplistic explanation is  of course  that we have not been living the same lives  having the same experiences  being the same person.Gus Van Sant's Last Days is a film that brilliantly takes this phenomenon into account. By not even attempting to compose a 'standard'-type scenario  with the traditional elements of plot  dialogue  set-ups  pay-offs  explanations - all the 'normal' things that most people expect a movie to give them (a commercial movie  anyway)  he has constructed something much  much deeper and far more profound: he has given us a motion picture that exists as free-form poetry or as a song  where the 'rules' are exceedingly more non-literal and abstract.In an artfully written poem (as with a great song)  the words (or lyrics) exist in their own reality  creating and evoking that reality as they unfold  allowing each moment to be the impetus for the next. It makes sense  a good poem (or song)  even if you can't exactly explain what it's about  what every word or phrase actually means - it's the FEELING you get from it that moves you every time you read it (or hear it)  and if you try to explain to other people what you feel about it  they most likely will not feel exactly what you feel  even if you find people who share your deep connection to the poem (or the song).Last Days EVOKES  from the very first frames to the very final ones and beyond. Of course Van Sant wasn't there with Kurt on his last days on this planet  and of course he has no idea what really was going on in Kurt's mind during that period (or any other). He doesn't presume to try to give us that. What we get  rather  is a soulful  lovingly heartfelt meditation on one individual's state of being. The person in question happens to have been a supremely gifted musician  whose music came from a place of magnificent purity and intense pain  a person who  through his music  spoke to a generation in a way that only a musician (or a writer) could. This is depicted as well  in the movie's best scenes  where Michael Pitt (who more than evokes Cobain in this performance - there are no words for what he achieves here) plays music; in the midst of his near-incoherent primal state  he is still in touch with his essence  his soul - the music.If you go into this movie thinking it will explain to you who Kurt was  or if you think it will match some image you have in your head of who he was or might have been  you'll be disappointed. Or if you stumble into the theatre not even knowing much about its subject  you might not understand what's being offered here. I was a very big follower of Nirvana  and particularly  Kurt  who of course was the soul of the band. I had a strong feeling for him and a supreme respect for what he was able to wrench out of himself  vocally  lyrically  all the rest. This movie blew me away  quietly  without any fanfare  without any warning.\tLAST DAYS (2005) * 1/2 Michael Pitt  Lukas Haas  Asia Argento  Scott Green  Nicole Vicius  Ricky Jay  Kim Gordon  Harmony Korine. Gus Van Sant's continued experiment in testing his audience's patience with his minimalist tone poem subjective jaunts tests the nerves to full throttle effect in this loosely based look at the last days of a Kurt Cobain-ian musician (Pitt  channeling the late Nirvana front man with uncanny ease) stumbling and mumbling about his estate with hangers-on and the usual odd-ball existential hooey Van Sant ladles on that only makes matters worse when one is straining to hear the minimal dialogue fumbled and weird audio tracking score. All apologies indeed!\tNot everyone will love \""Last Days.\"" Nonetheless it concludes a minimalist trilogy that does more to build Gus Van Sant's cred as a serious and original filmmaker than anything since \""Drugstore Cowboy\"" and \""My Own Private Idaho.\"" And in its way it's every bit as good as its predecessors  \""Gerry\"" and \""Elephant \"" and like them is HBO-sponsored and exquisitely filmed in a boxlike and claustrophobic small format. The irony is that this career-making role for the young Michael Pitt that \""Last Days\"" contains is one in which he only mumbles and hardly speaks. But he embodies and lives and becomes his role as few actors you will see this year have done. He goes to a dangerous and disturbing place. River Phoenix might have taken the part  but maybe it's a good thing for him he never did.Pitt channels the dying spirit of Kurt Cobain as he was  isolated in a big house  avoided by people there and avoiding them and almost everyone who came looking or called. Once he picks up the phone when his producer is calling and he listens  but never speaks. Blake (Pitt's character's name) is a shaky  peripatetic Howard Hughes  who goes native in the first sequence  wandering in a daze  walking into the woods  bathing in a river  spending the night by a bonfire of sticks. The mumbling is eerie  it's eavesdropping without insight for us. As he returns to the house  stumbles about  prepares makeshift meals in the kitchen  puts on a dress and brandishes a shotgun  the lack of human interaction brings home as no dialogue-written scenes ever could how isolated and mad he has become.Since \""Last Days\"" is largely a mood piece -- a splendidly original  dreamlike one -- setting is crucial and the old stone house with its crumbling  paint-peeling walls and mess and sound equipment and instruments and paintings  is a major player  so well represented in the elegant  original cinematography of Harris Sayides that it resembles no place else you've ever been. There are three or four other people in the house -- the action's so chaotic and haphazard you may not quite know who or how many. One's clearly \""Asia \"" Asia Argento  and she's sleeping with \""Scott \"" Scott Green  and there's \""Luke \"" Lucas Haas  tall and gangly in Coke-bottle glasses. Blake sneaks up on Asia and Scott with a shotgun when they're in bed together sleeping. Typically  nothing happens. He doesn't shoot  and they don't notice him. They and other people go out to and return from nightly revels. Blake is\u0085 just there.As in \""Elephant\"" Van Sant's approach is neutral. He does not analyze or explain or judge  and the actors are free to improvise and be themselves. Blake's respected because it's his house  but he's also a kook. Random visitors who're let inside are grotesque and comic: first it's dorky but cute twin Mormon \""Elders \"" then a large well-spoken black man selling a renewal of a Yellow Pages ad from the year before. \""How's your day been so far?\"" he asks as an opener. \""Uh\u0085.it's another day\u0085.\"" mumbles Blake. He's cooperative in a rote sort of way but there's little indication he knows what he's talking about. There's a detective and a young man who once knew Blake  who escapes them and other people by running outside to the woods again. These two are neither sinister nor funny: they just are. They're just interlopers  like everybody else  into Blake's lost world.The method in this trilogy has in common that it requires quiet acceptance of the proceedings; that if you give yourself up to its sometimes real time sequences (especially in \""Gerry \"" where Van Sant says they're influenced by Hungarian filmmaker B\u00e9la Tarr)  they're hypnotic and special  and if you don't  they're just irritating and boring. The experience requires a lot from the viewer. It's hard to describe a movie in which little happens. Nothing turns out to be quite a lot and you might remember that James Joyce wrote a long detailed novel about the events in the life of a little man in a single day in Dublin. It's certainly important that Pitt is deeply in character. If his acting were mannered or theatrical or unfelt  nothing would work. When he finally sings one song  a plangent cry of despair with the refrain  \""It's a long lonely journey from death to birth \"" it's very Cobain  but Pitt's own song and passionate  exciting performance.There's a kind of climax here  but there's nobody (but us) to witness it. Luke and Scott are up in bed with each other. As in \""Elephant \"" several sequences repeat. Blake seems to be dying repeatedly  as Asia stumbles upon him lying on the floor and he seems to nod out  though you never see him do drugs and maybe it's just the after effect of them from long before. Finally he's gone. We don't see him do that either. His soul quietly climbs naked up out of his supine body  like a Duane Michals photo. Then there's all the police  the ambulance  and the other inhabitants sneak off  as Blake did. It's all a pageant. I felt right at home in it remembering Oregon  Washington  the hippie days of the Sixties: it was there for me. I know it was Grunge Rock and Kurt Cobain  to whom this film is dedicated  died in 1994  at 26. The point is that it feels real. But its relation to real events is tangential. And if you give yourself to it and take it in its own context it's a wonderful film  a beautiful funny-sad experience of doomed-damned youth and a deeply felt meditation on isolation and death.\tWhen i walked into this film i had all of the critics and so called \"" nirvana fans \"" questions and phrases stuck in my head. But as the credits rolled for the previews  i began to remember that Van sant is a director who you either hate or love. Understand or confused by. Just as the film started i forgot all those feelings and for an hour an a half  i was somewhere else. i remembered i liked Gus.The entire film  is character development. It doesn't take dialogue to understand a person or a group of people. Watch them long enough. Watch them interact with others long enough and you'll see what kind of person they are. Blake is an old man stuck in a younger body. You'll see as you watch him that he thinks ahead of everyone else. His mind already on another issue as the others slow down behind him. Which sadly leads to his end.Gus really showed his directorial qualities much better in this one than any of his other films. I really felt apart of this film  right up until the death scene. forget all the nirvana fans that say Kurt would have hated this film. Forget all the controversial. just remember this is a film  a piece of art. and i must say i've never seen a death scene done with such class. a very spiritual film with an impacting message if you can find it. 10/10. one of the best films I've seen in many years.\tI didn't expect \""Last Days\"" to be anything like Van Sant's \""Good Will Hunting\""  and I knew that Cobain's last days were spent doing nothing  but I didn't really expect that a movie would be made about a guy doing nothing. But  a las  there was.The fact that the names of the characters were changed was distracting. There is no chance of having \""rights issues\"" violated by making an unauthorized biographical account of a deceased person  so why did Van Sant do it?The long  locked-off shots of 'Blake' walking around just felt so contrived and arrogant. Who else  but Van Sant  would be allowed to shoot in such a way? However  I preferred it over Michael Bay's ADHD style off shooting in \""The Island\"". But that movie was bad  too.While the movie did make me think  it also made me sleepy. I appreciate a break from the normal  mainstream movies  but I also like a good story. There was no story here. It was a look at a few days in the life of a depressed person with a heroin addiction-- If it were not based on a celebrity  it would have been no less interesting.\t\""Last Days\"" may have to be considered on two levels. As a film that pointedly denies it is based on the life of a famous rocker  it can be looked at on its own  without outside references or plot similarity expectations. But the film is dedicated to Kurt Cobain  most of the plot points are taken from what is known about his last days  lead actor Michael Pitt's hair  body look  use of language and music are so eerily evocative of Cobain that it is difficult to not see it as a sort of concentrated bio pic or \""J'Accuse\"" of who or what killed him.So if I were unaware of the Cobain back story  the film seems to be a heartbreaking look at the ravages of mental illness  aggravated by drugs and pressures  as \""Blake\"" looks and sounds like the muttering schizophrenics who scatter around NYC parks  reinforced by his plastic wristband from a \""clinic \"" and though we never actually see the drug imbibing to easily blame his behavior on addiction. Leslie Shatz's sensitive sound design is an equal partner with Pitt's performance in conveying \""Blake\""s mental state as almost auditory hallucinations of heightened senses (much more subtle than in a \""A Beautiful Mind\""). We see him first as prelapsarian figure  all his senses reveling in the clear air  water and fire of a woods  until the modern world intrudes with the symbolically redolent sounds of an airplane  train and church bells  calling him to fulfill his physical cravings. Dressing up in outfits ranging from a slip to a hunter complete with rifle  he actively avoids most human contact and is pretty much only lucid when writing or singing or creating music. His final moments are ambiguous but conveyed beautifully  a highlight of Harris Savides' crisp and lovely cinematography.The second theme is its chilling look at the issue of human responsibility as everyone around \""Blake\"" wants something from him and is oblivious to his fragility in their selfishness. He is approached by a Yellow Book salesman incongruously congratulating him on his success over the past year  his angry tour manager  a befuddled guest asking for songwriting help (an excellent Lukas Haas with owl-like glasses); a possibly hallucinated Kim Gordon nagging him about his daughter; talky detectives sent by \""Blackie \"" possibly his wife who we only hear yelling on the phone  to hunt him down; and he just manages to avoid two Mormon missionaries. His house mates are liars and bed hoppers just looking to avoid any ties or commitments  even if they are probably stoned  possibly reinforced by their grooving to a Velvet Underground song  and one seems to just disappear. Repeating scenes from different perspectives  as writer/director Gus Van Sant did in \""Elephant \"" just makes them seem even more culpable in their neglect.With real world references  there's amusing irony when \""Blake\"" turns on the TV and a Boys II Men romantic video plays  perhaps commenting how absurd it was that \""Smells Like Teen Spirit\"" became an MTV staple.Pitt doing his own songs acoustically recalls Cobain's \""unplugged\"" take on Leadbelly's haunting \""Where Did You Sleep Last Night.\"" At the very least  one certainly sees the depths of the anguish that produced Cobain's tortured music and suicide. If this is a tribute to Cobain  it is a sadly sympathetic one.\tthe new gus van sant movie 'last days'  is a film based on the final moments of kurt cobain's life leading up to his suicide (or murder for those less convinced). as with van sant's more recent films like the previous 'elephant'  the movie is carried by a meditative  near placid pace that accentuates mood and an arresting realism over conventional plot development or narrative arc. like 'elephant'  a film based on the columbine shootings  there's no real need for storytelling  the historical events already well ingrained. we know quite well that there will be no happy ending. and again like 'elephant' this was a bold move as far as subject matter for van sant to make. if you grew up with cobain's music and resulting iconicism then you probably have pretty strong notions of what kind of person he may have been. i think this would be quite a challenge for a filmmaker  especially with a pop culture figure as huge as cobain was and still is. but van sant's stumbling and mumbling blake (not kurt  only 'based' on him) as played by michael pitt  never tries to state more than he knows he reasonably can  but simply puts to vision a sensitive impression of a disconnected soul on his last days on earth.\tI saw this movie shortly after leaving the Guggenheim  where I spent five long hours staring dubiously at a warped metal cube  trying to extract some meaning   to evoke some feeling or past memory  but i didn't have any luck.. I left feeling truly empty. The other half of my summer was spent in movie theaters alternating between summer blockbuster kitsch and the bathroom vomiting the butter from the popcorn . .. You can imagine the discombobulated state as i entered the theater this evening. i didn't know what to expect. I did see a group of trendy looking kids wearing sunglasses in the darkened corner of the theater hall . So maybe at one point I began to expect something that didn't actually turn out the way I expected it to. At all. The only American directors i can place close to Van Sant at this point is Terrence Malick and David Gordon Greene. If you don't know who either of these people are  or you do know them and don't happen to like their movies  you will probably want to strangle your date for bringing you to this. The one thing they all have in common is  well  for lack of a better word  'atmosphere'. I know that word is tired now and has been used to describe this film in countless articles and interviews  so i'll try some others that come to mind: ambiance  impressions  feelings  mood  taste  tone  space   spirit  sense  semblance  color  environment. FORGET PEOPLE. Last Days isn't about people so much as it's about an empty vessel careening towards a deep dark black hole somewhere in the center of a self contained galaxy  swerving to avoid human contact at all costs. you're left with a kind of lingering love for something beyond humanity  In Van Sant's world  humans are apathetic  distant  unloved and incapable of loving or expressing real feelings  except perhaps anger and depression  but are capable of a sort of redemption. This is immediately a turn off for many people  especially for domestic audiences who've been weaned on melodrama. Long camera shots  soft focus  careful color modulation  jump cuts  loops  abstract sound structures/scape's  even a climactic double exposure (in camera ill bet)  every old school trick in the book to water the parched film students who've been waiting so patiently for this movie to arrive  and it finally has.. In the states! I'm gonna warn you now if you can't sit in the forest or on a mountain comfortably for a couple hours enjoying nature as it is  you probably won't enjoy this film. One of the most surprising (and pleasing) aspects is that the dialog is so sparse  I can't recall understanding one word the main character says  and some times I could hear the voice tracks being pushed to the left or the right speaker  instead of the standard center  making it even harder to comprehend. the films sequences are shocking in their simple brilliance and editing sans the use of Apple desktop computer (van Sant uses a STEENBECK he keeps in his house!!!!). And the sound design. Wow  this is one of the best sounding films I have ever heard in my life. a really interesting and creative use of design  motorcycles and carburetors clipping in areas where there should be none  the sound of water  birds  fire crackling  clocks ticking drowning in feedback of themselves ringing the hour  and one amazing sequence where Blake makes a guitar loop on an FX pedal and plays along with and howls into the Mic and captures that in the loop and crashes his cymbals belligerently and then after five minutes of that clicks it all off letting only the sound of the feedback remain... it just drives the whole thing from start to finish; van Sant makes a habit of cutting on the crest of a sound like somebody closing the door to the outside world or turning off the record during the best part - you hear the silences as deeply as you would the noises it is just so damn satisfying to see and hear a director experiment like that today. I really thought it was over soon. That we were reaching a point of creative singularity  that it's all dried up and we have to rely on past stories and books and movies and art to make more  either that or we'd have to just stop one day. this was something of a spiritual experience  something i feel very rarely  using the simplest means to construct a shockingly effective film from basically... Nothing...\twell  i was really disappointed with this. after being absolutely blown away by gus van sant's last film  elephant  i was so looking forward to this too. and since elephant  in some ways  covered similar ground (it was an imagining of a columbine-like school shooting incident  this is an imagining of kurt's last days)  i thought there was a lot of hope for it.alas  it's really  in the end  just kinda dull. harris sayides' cinematography is quite beautiful at times  and very melancholy  but where in elephant it felt as if the lingering shots and heavy pacing had a lot to say about the monotony of school life  here they just labour"
Lost in Translation (2003),"When Bob and Charlotte and their Japanese friends went to the disco  what kind of gun the bartender used which made them all run away? My 2 cents worth in: a beautiful  beautiful  minimalistic and very very touchy movie... Some reviews say Sofia didn't do it herself  because it takes a lot of life experience. Don't know  wouldn't comment on that  but one thing for sure: the movie was done with a great deal of humanity  sensitivity  and subtlety. And  not to forget to mention  with a great deal of love for Tokyo. Wish I could go there sometime... Such a fascinating country and culture...Just love it.. Watched it 10 times already\tIt is curious how some reviewers here deride those who did not like Lost in Translation  practically insulting them. Lost In Translation is not a movie for everyone  especially those with a decent knowledge of modern Japan. Nor is it a subtle masterpiece that only emotionless brutes are unable to enjoy. Western cinema must be in a sorry state indeed if an average film like LiT is lit up as the movie of a year because it dares take two steps away from standard formulas like the age-old love story or a clearly defined main character. Those two steps are not enough  they won't take a movie anywhere.Coppola should be given some credit on creating a solid movie and directing an actor like Murray  but the film itself is too void of meaning and message to leave an impression. The main characters are not probed more than shallowly  which is a lost opportunity with an actor such as Bill Murray  and expected with a choice such as Scarlett Johansson  whose young age is so obvious as to harm the credibility of the film. Even with a setting like the futuristic Japan  the movie is not able portray anything which is not already old and rugged from repetition. All in all  if you are expecting an insightful or a masterly directed film  you could very well end up disappointed.\tLet me first comment on a peculiar phenomenon that influences my choice of film. I sometimes have this feeling where i'm in the need of easy and fast entertainment like blade 3 or bad boys 2  so when i'm about to rent a movie I often prefer these movies above  for example  Lost in Translation  while at the same time i find these sort of movies to be \less\"" than the likes of more mature movies. so it took me a while before i decided to rent Lost in Translation and now that i have seen this movie I must say and I must comment on this site  how great this movie really is.This means a lot coming from a guy who prefers movies like FightClub Hero and Scarface over drama. But is this because i don't like drama or is it because I have the wrong idea of drama. Drama films to me  almost always mean people crying every 5 seconds  unwanted and misfit sentiment with a story that 4 out of five times couldn't interest the biggest titanic fan ( really crappy movie ). If this defines drama then Lost in Translation is not a drama film.It is the only movie i've ever rented 2 times in one week  and for a movie without any excitement or action this really is a wonderful feat. As is the fact that it left me with both a smile as well as a head full of thoughts because it is a movie you don't quickly forget about. technically it has great acting  a plus for Bill Murrays subtle but brilliant role  and Scarlett Johansson for great understanding of a character  it has a simple but greatly executed storyline  and has been expertly directed by Sofia Coppola.This all makes it a good movie  but it's the feeling about the whole movie  that cinematic magic that can't be captured in words  that makes it a great movie. Which movie has got and which movie hasn't got this magic all depends on the person who's watching it  but I can easily say that you don't have a clue about film if you say this movie sucks.So no matter which movie genre is preferred by you  take my advice  watch this movie or you will miss out on a great part of ( now already )film history.psi.I'm Dutch  so there's my excuse for the odd grammar mistakes.\tI heard this movie was great and perhaps that's why it left me so disappointed. Is there any fun in wasting half an hour with two boring and egoistic snobs complaining about their \""poor\"" lives? Bob is sad because he has to make a whiskey spot in a foreign country and they are only paying him two million dollars for that! And the pretty girl.. she has nothing to do but to flirt with middle aged men while his husband is working a lot to provide her with everything she wants. Oh  she tried to be a writer but she seemed unable to write more than two words together. And that's all they do for 90 forgettable minutes. I'm sorry for those who like this film because I found it suited only for a kind of hyper-sentimental  brainless person. There is NO plot at all  no meaning  nothing. At least he could have left her pregnant to expect a more exciting sequel. It didn't surprise me when I realized in the credits that such a senseless film was made by a woman. Of course  no one would have given a penny for this terrible movie if it wasn't by her surname. Boring  depressing  stupid  slow  senseless  irritating. By the way  I dislike Hollywood movies in general so I didn't expect to find explosions  special effects  guns or puppets. Go an see some good European cinema if you want deep feelings and some meaning at the end  because this is a fraud.\tThis movie certainly has some beautiful scenery and cinematography  but those are the only high points in this over-hyped snooze-fest. Lost in Translation is yet another movie victim to deceptive trailers. The trailers for this movie made it look like a comedy with a plot  whereas the real movie is a sloooooooooooooow-paced drama with a very loose plot. Two mopey-faced Americans bored with their lives wander around Tokyo together and do random things  at the end of the movie  rather than getting involved romantically  the two characters simply part ways and go back to their boring lives. (I did like the fact that they remained loyal to their spouses and did not have an affair). My problem with this movie is that it was all style and no substance. Maybe if this movie had a stronger and more intricate plot  and the actors would occasionally smile once in a while  or just show some emotion  maybe  I actually would have enjoyed watching Lost in Translation. I certainly did not enjoy this movie  but if you are fascinated by \""artsy\"" movies  you should give this a try.\tWhen I used to think of what made a good movie  I would look at a movie from all aspects: direction  cinematography  editing  acting  story etc. The sum of all these parts make up the whole  and are also what lead me to my opinion of a film...Then came Lost in Translation. The first time I watched this movie  I felt a strange sense of depression that lasted for a few days  but I couldn't put my finger on why. I watched it again and again  and felt the same way each time. I thought maybe it was because I have never traveled and would really like to  or that I have the desire to find the perfect woman in a strange world.Whatever the case  I realized one thing. LOST IN TRANSLATION MADE ME THINK. It made me question my life  its purpose  whether I was happy or not  and what I want do with it. Never has a movie touched me in such a way  and for that reason  this is the one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. That doesn't mean its the best movie ever made  in fact  I can name many that are technically better than this film  like the one I named before. But I cannot name a movie that has had more effect on me than Lost in Translation  and that is why I love it and will love it forever.Think of the last movie that really made you think  one that had such a great influence on you that it somehow changed your life  even for the littlest bit. That  to you  is a great movie...\tI loved the idea behind this film: strangers in a strange land and all that. The execution  however  is boring  meandering  and pointless. The main actors -- Scarlett and Bill -- have NO chemistry. Their relationship is not believable at all. The plot moves so slowly that I found myself nodding off during some of the scenes. I'm all for taking time to develop a story  but this was ridiculous! The film tries way too hard to be deep and to portray loneliness. It never succeeds. It falls short in so many ways and winds up being dull and boring. Additionally  the characters were terribly miscast. The idea of a romance between an extremely old  crusty  unattractive man and a young  wispy 18-year-old girl is ludicrous (wasn't Scarlett 17 when she filmed this?).On top of all that  the Japanese stereotypes are offensive and overused. (Oh  look! How funny! Bill Murray is the tallest man in the elevator. Not once  but twice!) This is a poseur film  through and through.\tThis film has been nominated for 4 important items of the Academy Award and referred very often  so I wanted to check out the hype. However  the film really disappointed me and eventually I was so released seeing the end. Sofia Coppola said the screenplay was based on her life. Then I have to say that her life and her way of viewing is really neither pointing nor poignant. The plot is neither exciting nor politically correct. Important western people working in the entertainment industry (and they're Americans) come to Far East and exploit all the pre-given stereotypes they learn  rather than going to explore the local culture and to know the differences between people. While showing that Japanese is a dominant language in Japan  the director forgets that Americans usually go around the world assuming everyone speaks American English. This film does not reflect most of feelings of travellers or lost people; instead  it is just about rich people (actors and actresses certainly fall into this category) going to big Asian cities looking for fun. Many stereotypes about Japan and Japanese culture have been represented in this film apart from one  which is the unbelievably expensive living cost there. And the actors seem spend money without hesitation  perhaps just like the director herself? Before seeing this film  I admire the Oscar having nominated a female director  but after seeing the film  I fear the Oscar nominated Sofia Coppola just because she's a woman and she's the daughter of Francis Ford Coppola.\tNot a Bill Murray fan  here  although I've been warming to him since \""Groundhog Day.\"" At any rate  he gives a very nuanced performance  which is saying a lot for this acerbic comic actor. When I viewed this movie I had no idea that people hate it. I only just got that from reading this page. I found it refreshingly nonlinear. This is one viewer who is tired to death of trite formulas in Hollywood film-making  and this film sidesteps trite by a mile. I'm not a film expert by any means  just a thoughtful person who views with curiosity and an open mind. So take my recommendation at its face value  nothing more. I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone who's attention span hasn't been ruined by contemporary television.\tSomeone here wrote \""The crucial word in all this is subtlety. The explosions of colour and sound that are used to portray Japan  are juxtaposed perfectly with the quiet  nervous  glances and words shared by the main actors. You can almost see what they are thinking  and read the confusion and turmoil that they are experiencing  at the same time as the pure pleasure and enjoyment of each other's company.\"" Yeah  I didn't understand what they were talking about either. To me  it sounded a little like \""The emperor's bright clothes are juxtaposed perfectly with his dark boots\""...If you like plot-driven movies  don't waste your time. It's just introspective images again and again and again. You may accuse me of being dull and having a short attention span  but it's quite the other way around: I quickly understood that the two characters feel alienated and disenchanted. I didn't need repetitive shots of Scarlett in the tub or looking out the window to get the point.And after I got the point  I was looking forward to something actually happening with it. Surprise  nothing does. Instead  I get beaten over the head with the \""We're so lonely  no one here understands us  but we understand each other\"" shtick. Not only is that horribly clich\u00e9  but it's nothing that I want to spend another 2 hours of my life watching.And I willingly rented this thing... that's right  I didn't expect any car chases or explosions. I was hoping to get the story of two strangers connecting and at least attempting to solve their problems together to teach some kind of new lesson to me. But the only moral I got was \""There are people you have fun with. Then they have to go away.\"" Very profound  but I learned that when I graduated from high school. And yeah  I knew that \""you can never get the perfect person\"" bit too.Finally  Peter Travers  did you watch this movie high? That's the only explanation I can think of for your \""Flat Out Hilarious!\"" comment branded on the back of the box. Okay  there were some chuckle moments. But I really must've missed the hilarious ones. I wish I could say I slept through them... that would have been less of a waste of time.3 stars... all for Scarlett's performance.\tThe main problem with this film is the lack of chemistry between the two principals who never convince that there is any true feeling between them. The script is also to blame since they never get to say anything to each other but meaningless snippets of dialogue. Compare with the masterly \""Before Sunrise\"" and \""Before Sunset\"" where you believe in those characters and in their mutual affection.The party scenes were also lame (the Japanese seem to be a cool breed and yet we  the audience  never were allowed to enter to enter their world as the main characters patently did) and the one joke (\""hey let's take the p*ss out of the Japs!!\"") soon began to tire and appear quite offensive.The hypocrisy of the leads characters (being sweet to their spouses while angling for sex) was also a great turnoff (as if was not for me in \""Before Sunset\"") simply because we are never given the chance to feel any warmth for this pair of insomniacs.All in all a good idea badly executed.\tWhen we are in a strange environment  maybe we will feel lonely just like Bob and Charlotte. But if you can find somebody to talk  thing will be different. Bob and Charlotte came to know each other accidentally  though they arrived at Tokyo for different purpose at the same time. They were both boring of present life. The more they knew each other  the closer between them. I was glad that they had no sex relationship. If that happened  the movie would be downgraded to an ordinary movie.It had a positive ending. Although I did not know what Bob said to Charlotte  that was sure to be their new start. If you have a real friend  you will never feel lonely again. In fact it is hard for a man to keep pure friendship with a woman in reality.Sofia Coppola gave us an excellent screenplay. She deserved the academy award. Bill Murray's funny show reminded me of Ghost buster. Obviously young Scarlett Johansson had a good potential. I am sure that she will have a bright future.A well-done movie that can warm your heart. 8/10\tWhat's the name of the song played when Bob and Charlotte are coming home from the Karaoke party  and they pass by the bridge and the rest of downtown Tokyo? Lost In Translation was overall one of the best crafted movies I've seen. Coppola did a masterful job of creating that perfect aura about the characters and developed their plutonic relationship perfectly over the course of the film  which is rich with cerebral music and inspiring Japanese landmarks  while revealing the true atmosphere of Japan throughout the film. The dialogue was perfect  and realistic resulting in the audience to feel a true empathy for two lost souls who temporarily find guidance in each others lives.\tThis movie is an unique movie that I would describe as a 'character comedy'. This is not a comedy with forced humor in it  it is a comical  yet ordinary observation of two different people in a strange foreign world  who are growing more and more towards each other. The humor and warm feeling of the movie is in the every day things and the strange but yet realistic characters. This movie is just like real life; slow and not every thing is always making sense or requires explanation. Sometimes things just happen  whether you like it or not.This is a movie that relies heavily on its two main characters played by Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray  two totally different characters who yet are 'attracted' to each other. It's obvious that at lot of parts in the movie moments were improvised  especially in the Bill Murray sequences. But somehow director Sofia Coppola manages to restrain Murray (something that most definitely is not an easy thing to do) and molds him into the character she want him to be. The fact that Murray perhaps plays the role of his life is thanks to Coppola's directing. Coppola and Murray should definitely make more movies together in the future.It's logical that this movie received an Oscar nomination for best picture  since this type of movie is new and yet works so well and feels so familiar and honest. I'm sure of it that in the near future we will get to see more movies like \""Lost in Translation\"" being made.Perhaps not the must see everyone makes you believe it is but still an unique  warm movie experience that surely is recommendable for everyone to watch  at least once. Chanches are you'll either end up totally loving it  or hating it.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/\tFirst she under-whelmed us with her writer's abilities with \""Life Without Zoe.\"" Then she added just a right amount of awful to Godfather III with her truly wooden acting. Now  having dabbled in everything else entertainment related  she dons the director's hat in some sort of vain hope that she will have found her calling - or at least something she doesn't completely suck at.Scarlett Johansson  in the \""I'm really not based on not Sofia Coppola  *wink wink*\"" role stars as Charlotte  a poor  ignored wife who has been all but kidnapped to Japan by her neglectful husband on his latest business trip to Japan. Surrounded by an island full of those inscrutable  shifty  swapping L's for R's  Japanese  she finds herself alienated in deluxe accommodations that must be costing her husband's employers more than most of us make in a year.Throw into the mix  Bill Murray as Bob Harris  a burned out has-been who sleepwalks through his latest gig - a Japanese whiskey commercial  because he probably thinks he should be doing Shakespeare - and probably for a white audience at that.The two meet and while the sparks obviously don't fly  they take joy in each other's misery  mutual isolation in the world's most populace island  and their asinine observations that the Japanese can't pronounce their R's properly - ignoring the fact of course  that neither one of them can speak a lick of Japanes. Typical dumb ass American tourists.Aside from the generic xenophobic swipes  Sofia Coppola  who also wrote this (if it can be said to have a story at all) sprinkles the story with every clich\u00e9 possible in an attempt to make her characters seem less like the whiny  bitchy  cry babies they are. At one point Charlotte begs her husband to \""just skip today.\"" We're supposed to tut-tut with disapproval as he tells her he can't  but given that this photography gig is only a few weeks  it would be the equivalent of one of us skipping out on  oh  a month of work. I think we can forgive him for not acceding to his needy wife's wishes.The story goes nowhere as it chronicles the journeys of Charlotte and Bob. If this movie had been made by someone else  ANYONE else  it would have been completely missed. As is  with the Coppola name  it has garnered accolades from every hipster doofus wishing for another Great Movie Dynasty. Sorry but Sofia Coppola falls short in her foray as a director  too. I will grant her that the movie is full of some positively beautiful images but maybe next time she'll cut to the chase and just publish a picture book instead.\tThis movie is not bad. It has a strong cast with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johnanssen in their best performances  a good director  but lacks timing. Bill Murray is an actor who comes to Japan to do a whiskey commercial. He feels lonely and ends up meeting Charlotte   played by Johnanssen who feels just like him. They develop a deep friendship that'll change their lives in many ways. Some viewers might get bored  like me  as the film unfolds very slowly. It's an average story about relationship and loneliness. No reason to call it the best film ever about loneliness. Wanna see a truly film about that  see High Noon  that is loneliness !\tBeing in a profession where there is constant noise  I enjoyed this movie for a very odd reason. The characters are pulling away from a hyped up society  away from a world  much of which is based on needless  trivial noise. Everywhere they go there is more numbing action. Watching the director of the commercial gyrating  trying to act like a real film director  despite the fact that they are doing a 30 second liquor commercial  typifies some of what this movie is about  a world where people are worn into the ground by a type A culture that is as vapid and unnecessary as we can imagine. I thought the Bill Murray character developed tremendously. While this trip to Japan was excruciatingly dull (money isn't everything)  I believe that he began to see things he hadn't seen before. I liked that while he was struggling with his marriage  the crises were simple  day to day things that living brings to us. The young woman he meets shows through a whimsical kindness  that he is worth something. She is refreshing to look at an to be with. He  like many middle aged men  has self doubts. Because she has a sense of purity and can talk to him honestly about her world and his  he should go back to his life a little more sustained.\tI'm ashamed to say that this was one of those films that I \""didn't get around to\"" seeing in the cinema and somehow there was \""always something else\"" to rent in Blockbuster a few months later. I really should be ashamed.The film is stunning  it effortlessly conveys what it REALLY feels like to be away from home  lost and lonely. The use of music and sound (or lack of it!) are touches of genius and the performances and stunning - Bill Murray with depth? who'd have thought it and Scarlet has to be the find of the decade. The use of members of the public as unknowing extras is a well tried trick to add realism into a film and seldom works  but here it adds to the whole mood of the film perfectly giving it the secret ingredient - totally believable characters and situations.Bittersweet in its plot  it kept reminding me of Last Encounter (silly as it sounds) and fears of spoiling it all with a sickly sweet \""Hollywood\"" ending were thankfully unfounded.It's one of those rare films that you don't watch as much as let wash over you -never quite understanding what makes it so good or enjoyable. And yes  it passes the true test of a classic film - the fact that you're still thinking of it days and weeks afterwards.This really will go down as a classic and a reminder that Film as an Art form works best when people are its central focus and actors are allowed to act. The only disappointing thing is the (long) wait for the next good one to come along ....\tI should point out that I am not as much affected as other people. It is pointing out a loneliness of a famous celebrity who has millions  but doesn't have love and care in his life. The dialogs are very good built that is one aspect and it creates a meaning in the movie. However the general view I have about the movie is not so different from similar ones.The acting is good while I feel uneasy with some characters. Charlotte was one of them. She had problems of neglect with her husband and she had her chances to return back to home. Why bothering asking Bill Murray to stay there? Go back with him. It seems as she needs a good  caring friend  but she also wants to be where her husband is. Thats not so logical to me.The lifestyle of Tokyo has been quite sharply pictured in the movie. That is good  but not the real thing I was looking around in this movie.The reason why I really didn't get all along with the movie is I am an easy adapting person. I really don't know  but generally a good movie that one can watch and won't bother watching again unless you go to Tokyo.\tWell  the movie was shot very beautifully.I do wish  however  that at the end of the film  the Japanese culture could have been explored through the eyes of less shallow  changed American people.Why should I feel sorry for a girl who is bored with her life and who is a snob? And why should I feel sympathetic towards a man who is making 2 million dollars and is whining about it? Right there  one can easily see how unhealthy the modern American society is! At the end of the film  I do not see them changing their internal worlds. He is not any happier or nicer  she is still a confused person. The truth is these people were not working on making their family lives happier and I doubt that Bill Murray's character would go home and try to be a better husband or a happier father.What was so bad about Giovanni Ribisi's character or his friends' that Scarlett's character had to laugh at them openly? I  as a viewer was not given a reason to think that she was any better than them. I understood the whole searching for spiritual life on Scarlett's side  but for somebody who was Yale educated  it was foolish for her to think so low of people. The problem with a storyline is that it had two lives that intersected for no purpose but for some unrealistic hanging out! The story line started well  but the characters could have taught each other something useful."""
Madagascar (2005),"Fabulous Film! Very funny - made me laugh out loud which I didn't expect at all! Great animation - witty script - Highly recommended for ALL ages! I only went because my 12 year old and her friends wanted to see it but it's the funniest film I've seen in years!! The age range of our party of six was 7 years to 50 and we all loved it. The animation was brilliant - particularly when things are going wrong for the characters in the film! The animation allows the characters to 'expand and contract' where necessary which makes them even funnier! The dialogue between the four main characters is just brilliant and in some places would not have been out of place in a sitcom like 'Friends' or even 'Sex In The City'! (Somwhat bizarrely!!). You can safely go and see this film with ANYONE of any age and will be guaranteed to feel much better afterwards!!!\tHo hum...another kiddie-flick serving as a vehicle to show off how far CGI has progressed since the last kiddie-flick. OK yes  the CGI is  as you'd expect these days  stunning  and the film is probably worth watching for that aspect alone if you're into that sort of stuff. As to the non-CGI aspects of the film  it's a rather tedious affair with predictable humour and uninspired dialogue. Not even close to the wit and originality of your average Bugs Bunny or Roadrunner cartoon (of course  those were brilliant so I suppose that's an unfair comparison  since no one these days seems able to write with that level of flair or originality). I find when viewing these sorts of films that it helps to imagine what they would be like if the images were all hand-drawn as in the pre-computer days. Would the film still hold your interest? In most cases  no. Still  Madagascar is probably a good way to entertain the kids for an hour and a bit  but you should probably bring along some mental baggage of your own to keep your mind occupied  since this film won't do it for you.\tMy four year old totally failed to get into this movie - from about half way through  he kept asking how much longer it was  and could we go home? Madagascar is mildly funny for adults (at least in its New York stereotypes)  but there's far to much rapid verbiage and the characters suffer from too much angst for small children to really be interested. Some of the slapstick made my son laugh  and he was occasionally scared  but he really didn't care at all for the characters. Neither did I - they're just not very likable.For me  the movie would have been much better if they'd removed the four heroes altogether  and concentrated on the penguins.Give this one a miss.\tI saw Madagascar in Chinese translation with my siblings and I find the movie absolutely hilarious. For a people who enjoy animated movies as much as me  you'll realize that a lot of the movie was \copied\"" or should I say \""have adapted\"" scenes from other movies.This movie is worth praising because of many reasons. The connection of the characters  the wonderful storyline  the excellent artwork as well as the wonderful computer graphics.The friendship and loyalty display by the four animal friends in this movie is definitely worth praising. Although it has also caused them tremendous trouble at times  it shows the kids teamwork  honestly  loyalty  friendship an above it all - trust. This is an extremely good example to the young children  showing them that in friendship  you need trust  loyalty and honesty.I recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to have a good laugh no matter who they're with or where they are.\tI must admit to not being a fan of the Dreamworks animations. They don't look particularly inventive  the voice talent is often at best distracting  or at worst  poor  and the stories are very sparse.Madagascar really is no exception to the rule. We first meet the heroes of the film - the animals - at the New York Zoo. Marty (voiced by Chris Rock) is a zebra bored with captivity and longing for the freedom of the wild. Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller) is a vain yet cowardly lion  happy to pose for the public in his cage  and so full of himself that he buys Marty little icons of himself as birthday presents. Melman (voiced by David Schwimmer) is a hypochondriac giraffe  while Gloria the hippo (voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith) is an earth momma  keeping her pals in check.There is a also a small mafia of penguins in the zoo who want to go to Antarctica. These are funny and inventive characters  but a little at odds with the rest of the film.This film has its moments - the animals going on the subway to Grand Central Station; the squirrels and chipmunks who rule the island of Madagascar (the wild Marty is so keen on); and the film and TV references - Hawaii Five O  Born Free  Chariots of Fire  American Beauty  and more.But the characters are two-dimensional  the script is needlessly childish (yes  I know it is for kids  but give them some credit for having brains)  and the film is pretty pointless  other than the same old 'you've got a friend' theme that pervades almost every film from the studio. The voice talent is just OK (and Ben Stiller in particular makes Alex irritating) and the animation is boring.Not one I'd rush to see again.\tFirst of all  I would like to tell you that I haven't had this much fun in the movie theater in a long time. There are a lot of subtle gags in this film and you're permanently laughing. The voices are very well matched to the characters and I think they actually took advantage of a very simple plot and turned it to very subtle and clever gags  that's what all the movie is about. Of course that if you are a serious person and you're looking for a long  thought over plot you have to go and see some other movie  but for me  it did the purpose and it actually surprised me. I went with no expectations to the movie theater (because I've seen Shrek  The Incredibles and Monster's Inc)  but the movie did not disappoint me at all and surprisingly  was a lot of fun. Concluding: I enjoyed this movie a lot  laughed a lot and commented all the gags with my friends once I got out of the theater (laughing again of course) and for me  it was a wonderful \""de-stressing\"" moment in the evening and I went to bed with a smile. Enjoy!\tOne walks out of the cinema with a feeling of expectations not met... But this movie wasn't the worst made up-to-date. Maybe we as adults have become too used to \""children's movies\"" catering more for the adult sense of humour  than children's. \""Madagascar\"" is for the kids. \""Robots\"" were for the adults. For us grown-ups  only the penguins were extremely funny  and the rest were smilable but not nowhere in the league of \""Toy Story\""  \""A Bug's Life\""  \""Robots\""  etc. Some spoofs from movies like \""Cast Away\"" (the ball)  Lion King (the hienas) were functional  and this helped with some humorous bits. Excellent animation. A bit of time wasted if you're older than 12  though...\tAs others have already pointed out  this is an occasionally funny but overall a disappointing film (Although I wasn't expecting much to begin with). Chris Rock (the best of the main characters)  Jada Pinkett-Smith (who has hardly any input)  Ben Stiller & David Schwimmer (primarily a one joke character) all struggle with underwritten roles. Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen - Mr. Ali G) & Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer - Not a character name!!) are very enjoyable  but it is the Penguins who  without a doubt steal the movie. The (all too) brief flashes to the penguins are an adrenaline shot in the arm of a flagging movie. This film is only slightly better than the truly awful Sharks Tale  and both films despite having some fantastic set pieces  in-jokes  visual gags & snappy lines  suffer from a lack of emotional investment as we the audience never truly care for the characters  like we did of Woody  Buzz  Nemo  Marlin & the Incredibles. If Dreamworks Animation are really serious about being an equal contender in the 3D (& to a lesser extent 2D) animation market they have got to start spending a lot more time on writing & developing both the story & especially the characters  before throwing (& waisting) wonderful talent & fantastic visuals & occasionally clever gags at these rather lazy  paper-thin stories. I have no doubt that the younger kids will be kept amused and the older crowds should enjoy the odd moment  but your better off waiting for the DVD. Long Live Pixar!\tI've got several animated movies in my private DVD collection  even though I'm no longer a kid. And yes  I always buy them for myself  since I don't have any children (and not planning on having one soon either) or a younger brother or sister. On the other hand  I must also say that I have a rather specific taste. I don't really like the average Disney fairy tale-like movies. I prefer movies like Ice Age  Shrek  The Incredibles ... in which some fine animation is combined with excellent humor. After seeing the trailer for this movie  I was really curious about it. Would it be for children only  or would an adult like me also be able to enjoy it? \""Madagascar\"" tells the story of four animals at New York's Central Park Zoo who have lived there all their lives  don't know what life in the wild is like and don't want to know it either... except for Marty the Zebra. When he breaks out of his cage and makes a trip through the center of New York City  his friends Alex the Lion  Melman the Giraffe and Gloria the Hippo go after him to get him back. But the humans think that the four escaped because they wanted to go back to the wild and that's why they are put on a boat and sent to a wild reserve in Kenia. However  when their ship is hijacked and their boxes are accidentally thrown over board  they end up on a desolate island where they will experience what life in the wild can be like and how much it differs from what they have known all their lives...Although this movie isn't perfect - especially the last part didn't always do it for me - I must say that I had a good time watching it. The animations for instance are excellent. I like the way the animals look (even though they may perhaps not be as 'perfect' as what you might see when Pixar had made them) and the surroundings are marvelous (New York city  as well as the island). I guess it is just a matter of taste  but in my opinion you can't really compare the different styles of animation. Disney differs from Pixar and Pixar is different when you compare it to Dreamworks. What's wrong with that? If all the animations looked the same  everybody would complain and say that they never try to create their own style and are only copying what works.Next to the animation  I also liked the diversity in the characters. Take for instance Alex. He's the star of the Zoo and he knows it  while Melman is a hypochondriac who always feels sick and Gloria is a huge hippo who clearly doesn't mind about her size. I even liked Marty the zebra  always craving for attention  but not seen as interesting enough by the audience. And those four characters are also joined by some very good sidekicks. Take for instance the penguins who acted like military commando's or the monkeys who act like they have a lot of style  but still do what any other monkey would do. I really liked the diversity in characters and had several good laughs with each of them.When I read the reviews from other viewers  I sometimes can't help smiling. The main reason for that is because some people seem to forget that this is just an animated movie  not a documentary. If you really want to see how these animals live and act  don't you think it would be better that you watch the National Geographic Channel  go to a zoo or go on a safari? I'm sometimes asking myself: Do they think the same about Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote? Or do they really believe that a coyote knows how to work with dynamite and can fall of a 1000 ft. cliff without dying? This is still an animated comedy so I don't care whether the animals look truthful or not (by the way: have you ever seen a monster like Shrek or a talking donkey in real life? I haven't  but that doesn't mean that I can't like them). The same for their comments on the humor or the - in their opinion - lack of it. They believe that the humor in the movie was only good for kids. I'm sorry  but I see that as an insult. I'm an intelligent 27-year old with two college degrees  but I'm still able to laugh with those 'stupid' and 'childish' jokes and the situation humor like for instance Alex falling in a field of cacti. When they see it in a Charlie Chaplin movie or \""Road Runner\""  they say it is excellent  but when it is done in an animated movie about some zoo-animals  they no-longer like it. Make up your mind people... All in all this is a movie that will not only appeal to children. The mature audience - it doesn't matter if they go watch it on their own or with kids - will have a good time with it as well. Next to a lot of situation humor  you will also get some fine references to well-known movies  which your children will probably not connect to another movie  but love anyway. My favorite reference was the \""American Beaty\""-scene in which Alex sees steaks falling out of the sky instead of rose leaves. Even though the end wasn't as strong as the biggest part of the movie  I still loved this movie enough to give it a 7.5/10  maybe even an 8/10. And if that means that I'm an immature man  so be it...\tWe watched this with our 6 and 7 year old kids thinking it was a great kids movie. We should have researched a bit more. Most of the movie they were gasping (both can read) at the swear words. What's the deal lately with kids movies needing to say things like \""Oh Sh(pause)ugar honey iced tea!\"" (reference to \""Oh Sh*t\"") and \""Damn  Hoover Dam\"" It's unnecessary and could be just as well played with a \""Darn  Rats\"" etc.After Shark Tale and now Madagascar we're pretty much giving up on Dreamworks cartoons if one more is released with this kind of crap in it.Really  do they need to show the word HELL behind the lion when he's feeling bad? We know he's feeling bad  he LOOKS sad. Keep it simple Dreamworks  and all of us families with kids will be back again and again. We spend BIG bucks at theatres to keep our kids happy. Don't miss out on it because you have to be a \""cool guy company\"".Keep up the garbage mouthing  and we'll leave you cold.\tThis film had it's good and bad parts. On one hand  the plot was predictable  the jokes not particularly funny and the speed of the characters movement gave me a headache (they constantly run around and jump and dance). I did like the characters  although they weren't anything new or interesting. David Schwimmer (as the giraffe) made me laugh  but mainly because I could compare the personality of the giraffe to that of Schwimmer's character Ross in the TV show Friends - both a bit paranoid and very cautious at all times. Ali G (as the lemur king) made me giggle as well when he danced  and I particularly liked the 'wackiness' of his character. The penguins were probably the most enjoyable characters on the film - they were \""psychotic\"" (as the lion Alex liked to call them) and I found them very entertaining to watch. The animation in this film was very well done. I noticed in particular the perfection on the water effects (eg by the sea in Madagascar or in Gloria's swimming pool) and Alex's mane (how it moves when he does). I would say this film is enjoyable. It isn't anything new or fantastic  but it did have small moments where it made you smile or laugh. Otherwise it got a bit predictable really. My advice - see if you liked Shrek. But don't expect too much - the trailers make it look better than it is!\tI've seen this movie and I want to say that it is a terrific comedy. For those who haven't seen the movie  I recommend to watch it. I mostly like the penguins  because they are so funny. But the other characters are funny as well. The subject is interesting  and the graphics are good. The way the actors are speaking make the movie way more funny and the more you've watched the movie  the more you want to continue watching. From all voices  Marty's voice was the best. When you listen Chris Rock speaking in a movie as a zebra  you will want to see the movie till it's ended  and then  you feel sorry that it didn't last longer. But  that's it  and we must enjoy what we have so  what are you waiting for? Go see the movie!\tMy son and I enjoyed the movie but wanted to see MORE of the PENGUINS and less of the other characters. The main characters (Marty  Gloria  Alex  Melman) suffer from \""a deplorable excess of personality\"". They were so stereotypical and overdone  as if the actors were afraid that they couldn't convey enough attitude to make the characters easy to identify. The egotistical \""king of the beasts\""  his fun-loving sidekick zebra  the \""Big is beautiful\"" hippo and the hypochondriac giraffe. They were annoying rather than clever. Despite this  we loved the penguins...Rico in particular. We could watch Rico all day. WE WANT MORE PENGUINS AND MORE RICO! Leave the other animals in the background and give the penguins the spotlight! MORE RICO! It's still a cute movie and perfect for kids to watch.\tOverall I found this movie quite enjoyable. The script was fun  obviously aimed at a younger age group  but was able to hold the attention of accompanying adults as well with some witty comments.The characters were quite well done  if there were some frustrating moments that were a little over the top as the movie progressed. Some of the way certain animals were interpreted was very interesting and at times  I found  quite hilarious. ( Judging by the reaction of a 5 year old beside me  I would say that I am not the only one).Overall this movie is worth a look for some light  good quality family entertainment.\tNot really much to say other than it was the most unfunny film i've ever seen. It tried so hard but totally failed to deliver. The only funny animals were the penguins and they were hardly in the film. I greatly enjoyed 'Finding Nemo' and 'The Emperors New Groove' and was hoping this would be something similar. Unfortunately I was massively disappointed. I almost fell asleep in the cinema. Sacha Baren Cohen was hilarious in 'Ali G Indahouse' and should have been given the lead role in my opinion - if he'd have played some sort of similar Ali G character in this setting then the film could have been a great success I believe. Overall; a true waste of time and money.\tHaving a degree in the subject of animated computer graphics  I really enjoyed the visual style of this film  but I can heavily sense the predictable framework that runs through every other element of this entire feature. :o( It has all the smelly trademarks of a 'fun  kids' animation. The characters are copied stereotypes from other CG classics such as 'Shrek' (donkey) and 'Ice Age'. The slow  long scenes and thin storyline (what little there is of it) fail to enthral you.The trailer for Ice Age 2 was showing just before Madagascar and I personally enjoyed its character and story a lot more than Madagascar itself! See the amazing visuals at a mates house on DVD. Otherwise don't waste your money in the cinema.\tI have NOT read the comments on this picture. I probably won't check on responses to this comment  cause frankly  I check IMDb mainly for movie info. But I just HAD to say something that I can't believe this movie is so bad ranking. I just loved it!The main characters are good enough  the story is rich and funny enough  but when on top of that you throw Julien  the King of the lemurs (and sidekick) that's just too freakily funny and lovable to ignore!Always loved Ben Stiller and Chris Rock. Always LOVED computer animation (Shrek is top 5 of my comic movies).The visuals are also outstanding (And bare in mind that I watched this on a pirate DVD made in Russia) (sorry  if piracy offends). The quality was not the best...They even handled the flesh-eating friend-of-prey issue honestly  yet with lots of laughs. Yeah  yeah  I know: They finish killing innocent fish  but taken the setup into account I find it a rather elegant way out of the paradox.But i just LOOOOOOVED the lemurs  and proclaim myself a humble subject of King Julien.Elmer Homero\tThis movie was a great and wholesome. A friend and I both went to see it (both adults) and loved every minute of it. It was funny and contained good life lessons (even for adults). I enjoyed the soundtrack too! The characters each had their own personality and their own sense of humor that I found quite interesting and clever. It showed me that a lot of thought went into it (from the directors and producers) and loving care when making this movie and selecting which person would be the voice for each animal. The colors in the film were amazing! I am a visual person and appreciate things like this (color); therefore  this definitely made a difference in the way that I rated this film.\tI laughed out loud all through the movie. My granddaughter and daughter also loved it. I also liked the way the movie showed the variety of lemurs and other primates on Madagascar. Also the rocky boundary between the east part of Madagascar and the west is real and the reason the lemurs have survived in such variety. The east is rain forest and the west is populated by humans since it is arable. I don't know about the Fossas though. Are they a real species? They resembled hyenas or wild dogs in their behavior. The transition from zoo animal to wild was great in the way Alex the lion was portrayed. The voice of the head penguin reminded me of Danny DeVito  but he isn't listed in the credits.\tI have to admit that I expected more after having read some reviews. There are a few good jokes and I liked a few of the animals but I wasn't impressed with the film. I have to add though that I saw the German version and so with the original voices it might have been a totally different experience. For my taste there was too much talking and much of it was fairly repetitive. Much of it is also quite (superficially) focused on the US and the rest of the world may be getting fed up with this after a while. I didn't find the zebra's cheer-leading act in the background too funny. I wished more thoughts would have gone into the story."""
Mangal Pandey: The Rising (2005),"My Review: No Hindi film in memory (mine at least) has had as high expectations as Mangal Pandey. Mainly due to Lagaan  which is quite unfair. Granted  Lagaan is a masterpiece in every way  Mangal Pandey is not a sequel  prequel  or in any way shape or form related to Lagaan. Therefore while it may be difficult  it should be looked at as its own entity.Mangal Pandey starts off with a blast and starts out engaging the audience. However most reviewers and viewers alike have complained about the pace of the first half. I did not find this to be a problem at all  in fact I believe the first half is superior to the second.Aamir does a fantastic job as Mangal Pandey  as was expected of him. I wish he had spoken in a deeper tone in the film  as I imagined Mangal Pandey with a stronger voice. Although that cannot be held against him as very few actors take the risky plunge of slightly altering their voice. Toby Stephens is excellent as Mangal's friend William Gordon. His commitment to speaking Hindi as naturally as possible is evident throughout the film. Aamir and Toby have great chemistry and are quite believable as best of friends. Amisha Patel surprisingly did not go overboard in the film  and was happily part of the back-story. Rani Mukherjee does an acceptable job as the prostitute Heera  although she really needs to work on her emotional crying scenes. The rest of the cast also does a great job. The only acting complaints I have are that most of the British actors playing officers did not seem to put as much effort into speaking Hindi as Stephens did.The direction and editing of the film were very questionable. The film has a very amateur editing  and is it by FAR the biggest flaw in the film. The scenes and songs are all sloppily placed together  completely messing with the flow of the story. The songs are downright unnecessary and the film would have been much better without it. The story  and the feel of the characters start to get into your mind  and then all of a sudden comes a song and takes you right back into reality. On the topic of music  the background score of the film also is not very well done. It does not flow well with the film  often conflicts with the visuals in terms of moods. Where there should be aggressive music  there is a mix of heroic and happy music. It just doesn't help the film for the most part.Despite all the flaws in editing and direction  Mangal Pandey is still an enjoyable watch. It runs at a slower pace than most Hindi movies  and that may be a turn off for most Hindi movie viewers as they are accustomed to redundant love stories or nonessential action films. However  I believe that a movie does not need to be fast paced to be engaging.Congratulations to Aamir and the cast and crew (save the director and most especially the editor) for making a film of such gargantuan scope for Hindi cinema  even if it does not live up to it's unbelievably enormous expectations (but then again  could anything ever live up to those expectations??).Definitely worth a watch  go and see this film.7/10\tI saw the movie Mangal Pandey yesterday and the images are still quite vivid in my mind. I attribute this to the wonderful cinematography and the colourful canvas that Ketan Mehta uses to unfold the story before his audience.The madness in Mangal Pandey's  roughly translated as \junoon\""  can only be portrayed by a great actor. A. R. Rehman's music is so good that it can make your hair stand on end. The four story tellers atop an elephant visiting villages as they tell their story is a great narrative technique.The reviews of the film in the Indian film media shocked me. I fail to understand the motive or even the thought process behind them unless it is that we are all in the danger of succumbing to cheap cynicism when feelings or ideas of patriotism come up in a creative form.People have complained about the colour and the song and dance that Ketan has used. I believe this is because of two reasons--one is that Ketan has a theatre background and this is a part of folk theatre -to use music and dance to convey messages. The other reason is that in a movie dealing with the tragic consequences of brave actions it is important to to provide some kind of relief.Even the presence of the two women which has has been criticised  is important to give the feel of the time. Mangal Pandey had to be shown as a real living human being not some flat lifeless character unearthed from dusty history books. One of the female characters brought to light the repugnant practise of Sati whereas the nautch girl was used to depict the presence of pleasure houses for the company employees. Both are necessary to give us a realistic picture of that era.A comment was made elsewhere that the younger audiences found it hard to connect with the historical character. Is it easier  then for the youth of modern India to connect with MTV and reality shows with no content? And if this is so then does it not become even more important for our film makers to produce films with real content that may inspire pride in our culture and history? Mangal Pandey is a great film. From the first scene to the last you can see the immense amount of hard work that has gone into its making. The only thing that rankled was the voice over provided by Om Puri. It was unnecessary.I think the movie deserves great accolades.\tI saw The Rising on Saturday at the 3p.m. show at Naz8 in Lakewood Southern California. I loved it so much that I went to see it again at9.30 p.m. show at Cinema City in Anaheim Hills which is nearer my home in Yorba Linda.This time I loved it even more.On Sunday I saw it for the third time with my son and his wife and a cousin of mine.That is three times in two days. I plan to see it again tomorrow with my wife and some friends.I do not want to describe a scene or give away any part of the story because I might be accused of being a spoiler.My point is to inform my readers that finally a film has emerged from India that takes us back to the golden era of movies  when dedicated filmmakers like MehboobKhan  when geniuses like Naushad and Majrooh Sultanpuri when committed filmmakers like Guru Dutt touched our hearts and our souls.When K.Asifmade Mughal-E-Azam which retains its magic and luster even forty-five years after its release.The Rising is that kind of movie.It tells us  in no uncertain terms what a movie can do and what movie magic is all about.After MehboobKhan  Ketan Mehta is another gift from Gujarat to the Bombay film industry.He has directed The Rising with amazing dexterity and professional competence.His cameraman Dhamija is almost as good asFaredoon Irani  Jal Mistry or R.D.Mathur.And they as everyone knows were giants.The art direction  the editing  the choreography is topnotch.And as far as performances are concerned it will be a long time before somebody even comes close to Aamir Khan.He has stretched himself to the limit and then gone beyond it.Toby Stephens gives him excellent support.Rani and Amisha in their small roles are effective.The team ofJaved Akhtar and A.R. Rahman are once again at their very best.Rahman'background score  though unobtrusive  is awesome.This is a movie that keeps you absorbed from start to finish.It is gripping  entertaining and what's more enlightening.And with each viewing you like it more.It deserves to be India's entry for the Oscars.If it is sent by India it will definitely be nominated in all eligible categories and win inmost categories  especially in the best foreign film category.The entire team behind the creation of this great movie deserves to be applauded and congratulated.They have made India proud.\tWhen I saw the poster  I though it was a Latino flick. When me and my girlfriend drove up to the cinema  we saw many other latino's like us who ended up there for the same reason. I watched the movie expecting the weirdest of weird (i have watched some Asian flicks on TV) This movie woke us up. Me  my lady and many other latino and caucasians loved the movie. The music was weird at the start but i found myself shaking my head at the tunes. i gotta get me a cd from amazon soon.The movie wasn't Indian at all. the whole thing was in English though i couldn't catch some of the minor actor's language at times but my lady did. The story is about the Indian suppression. it isn't a 'west bashing' movie as i was afraid of - just the opposite. most important is that i had no idea about the story. it is an important part of history and so is good to watch. In addition  there was a lot of 'indian' style entertainment in the film in the music and dancing. Different but addictive. I'm going to buy the DVD if it is out alreadyFantastic movie  story and amazing acting.Mike C.\tA spectacular film based on Mangal Pandey's part in the 19th-century Bengal Army Sepoy's revolt against the British East India Company embellished by wholly fictional events  there is no historic record to support the most brutal events depicted. It is to be regretted that Bollywood has followed Hollywood in inventing history which some will now think to be truthful. Setting truth aside  this is a fun film to watch  the acting is good  the filming is good  the song and dance sequences  while essential to all Bollywood productions  are unaccustomed to a Western audience. The costumes are wonderfuly extravagant with jewels and sequins  the army uniforms as red as red can be. Editing could have reduced the length of the film without loss to the story. Overall worth seeing not worth seeing twice.\tI've always loved good acting... Daniel Day Lewis in 'My Left Foot'  Ed Norton in 'Primal Fear'  Geoffrey Rush in 'Shine'  etc. Eye-opening  knock-out acting in Indian cinema is rare... Nasseruddin Shah in 'Manthan'  Girish Karnard in 'Sangeet' and aside from a few roles (Amjad Khan as 'Gabar') good acting was non-existent in commercial Indian cinema. ENTER AAMIR KHAN!! He always was a good actor in my opinion... some of his previous work is brilliant but there was still that big divide between commercial and 'art' cinema in those days('1947 Earth'  'Raakh'). His performance in this movie though was very different.... Maybe because of the role  maybe it was the direction  but i strongly suspect it was the acting - IT WASN'T AAMIR KHAN ON SCREEN! It was someone else... actually  IT WAS MANGAL PANDEY IN PERSON!!!!! His presence on the screen was something that stunned me... I'm not talking about a 'Muqqaddar Ka Sikander' Amithabh Bachan type presence.... this was something else... here  the viewer developed his character just by watching the guy on screen! Aamir Khan was ... ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! The best actor in India without any hesitation! Heck  he was better than many of my fave Hollywood actors too.To be honest  the movie left me 10% dissatisfied... I was hoping to see another good 'period' depiction (like '1947 earth' where one's actually transplanted into that era). Ketan Mehta did a fabulous job  but it could have been better - some more 'real life' imagery wouleve helped (like the guys sitting around in the town square and chatting in 1947 Earth). Did it matter that the 'background' score could'eve been better? (Im sure it wasn't ARR's score... the song 'Mangala Mangala' on the other hand is nothing short of genius) Did it matter that some of the graphics were sub-par? Did it matter that some of the editing needed work? ... NO  NOT AT ALL!! Aamir Khan's acting more than made up for it... By far the best Indian actor there is! If you haven't watched it yet... GO WATCH IT! Its a movie of epic proportions and one of the top 5 movies from Indian Cinema of all time!*************WATCH THIS MOVIE!!***********\tWent into the theater thinking of 'Braveheart' and 'The Patriot'  especially since the promos were quite squarely aimed at evoking patriotic sentiments. Sadly  the movie didn't deliver... not that it's a bad film  but I was expecting a lot more action  many more 'British Raj was 100% tyrannical & evil' moments and a gripping conclusion. None of my expectations were met. Yet  it's a decent BOLLYWOOD movie with too many songs (the Holi & Mosque songs were completely uncalled for) and good acting. Just don't watch it with too many expectations like I did.\tAfter being delayed few times  the timing of the release of this film couldn't have been more perfect  just two days before the Indian I-Day. Any Aamir Khan film is always looked fwd to and it becomes more vivid if he is appearing on celluloid after a gap of four years. Add to this  another name Ketan Mehta who is India's most critically acclaimed director. And to top all this  a historical subject of Mangal Pandey-the first crusader of the first war of Indian Independence.Indian history has witnessed innumerable martyrs  whose names are easily forgotten or never mentioned. Such people's sacrifices needs more than just a mention in school's history books. Amongst many such names is the name of Mangal Pandey.This is a film where fiction meets real story set in 1857 AD when 'Company Raj' dictated the fate of people in Indian subcontinent. In such times  a brave Sepoy Mangal Pandey in British army decides to go against those who invaded the land first and then slowly everything up to the souls of individuals.This is when the first mutiny arises and a new page is added in the history of both Indians & British.Aamir Khan plays Mangal Pandey passionately with a complete conviction. His eyes  his skills  his overall persona go further to complement his onus as the most brilliant actor we've around. Toby Stephens excels as William Gordon who traverses the most difficult path where he finds himself constantly in tatters amid things like duty  friendship  loyalty and love  but he finds comfort in the company of Mangal Pandey who is a friend for life. Mangal and Gordon's love interests are pleasantly etched by Rani Mukherjee(Heera) and Ameesha Patel(Jwala)  in-spite of being there only for 'attracting-audience/commerical-success' method. But such cinematic liberties are excusable if it helps to boost the film in anyway.The film's attention to detail is immense and emerges visually very strong. A.R.Rahman's music doesn't seem to be his best or probably the oddity of songs' situation fails to create that musical impact  but 'Mangal Mangal' song is a spot-on to the theme and the central character. All the scenes between Aamir and Toby are a delight to watch. Toby doesn't fail to impress with his acting or his Hindi-speaking lines. Aamir's performance rises with every frame until he reaches the peak in the final courtroom scene where he surpasses all the perimeters of just being the finest actor around  but puts him clearly in a class of his own.After Lagaan(very strong film) & Mangal Pandey  the Indian filmmakers should think of a more substantial subject to hold the global audience instead of only trying to capitalise on India before independence. This is not to take away anything from the independence movement  but we've come a long way from that phase and its time to show that  without having to cater only to very 'Bollywood' (song&dance  colorful & heavily designed clothing  overflowing emotions  huge sets) style loving audience. These factors can make or mar a film depending on how naturally they get absorbed in a film script.While watching this film I deterred myself from any hype or expectations surrounding it  but still this ballad falls short of rhythmic compositions in totality. This rising only raises up to a likable and only-for-Aamir film mark  when it could and should've been much more.\tI was walking past the road of my thoughts  I was happy. I was singing. I was enjoying myself. I was complacent  I had stopped expecting. I had accepted that fate of my beloved \""Hindi-Cinema\"" has been written. It was never to come out of its \""BOLLYWOOD\"" syndrome and would remain a pauper body and soul. Walking along nonchalantly  I suddenly stumbled  Woke up from slumber and tried to find what it was. When I found  I smiled. It was a stone  a milestone. It read \""LAGAAN\"".I stood up  started walking again  happier  merrier  quite satisfied and a bit expectant now. I had walked a few steps  was thinking when'll I see another milestone. I had a few smiles in my eyes and was ready to walk a lot. But boy  I was caught unaware. I fell again. Ohhh..!! I looked around. There was another stone. A gold plated milestone. A milestone that came much before a mile. This one read \""Dil Chahta Hai\""I found myself walking once again  ecstatic this time. Completely out of slumber. Eyes gleaming with hopes  steps desiring to stumble and arms waiting to embrace the sculptor who had designed those milestones. I kept walking. This was proving to be long walk. But I was ready to wait. Two years passed by. I was a bit anxious but I was hopeful. My hopes doubled when I saw a board \""Next milestone after one year\"". I made me down but I knew I'll wait. I did. I walked more. Another year gone. I was looking around at every step. Where is the Stone ? Where is the sculptor ? All I saw was another board \""Wait for one more year  SCULPTOR AT WORK\""I said OKAY-what-the-heck. I had waited so long  Be it another year. I moved. Kept moving. Another year and here it was. This time it was not a lonely  deserted road. I could see \""The Rising\"" written on the sky  I could hear \""The Rising\"" reverberating from the clouds. I could smell \""The Rising\"" in the air. I was dancing to the tune of MANGAL  MANGAL....!! People told me not to expect too much. I said \""Why not..? I had walked so long...!!\"". I had all the adrenaline RISING and there it was.I was sitting in front of the screen. I had joined my hands together to clap. I was all set to give standing ovation to the Sculptor. But....................................!! I am speechless. Claps never came. No  not a single one. What came was a pathetic show of slapstick direction. What came was a poor display of run-of-the-mill imagination. What came was a full blown stupidity. I saw the sculptor shooting himself at the end of the movie. Yess  thats what he must have done. I saw him lying in the lap of Captain Gordon. No  it was not Captain Gordon  it was Ketan Mehta and he was not consoling Mr Khan  they were crying together. I came here finding a stone. I found many  not to stud them in my ring  but to throw them on the screen.It was branded as \""Independence Day Gift\"". Excuse me. My India deserves much better gifts and we gently return your gift Mr. Mehta.Happy Independence day.\tIndiana Jones in the Temple of Doom was better at a rising then Mangal Pandey in this particular movie. Steeped in a stupendous and historical let down  this movie could prove to be a BIG flop. Although it was already stated that the movie was not a complete historical movie  there was a blatant lack in respect of the usual laws of movie making. Spot the extra who is wearing what seems like a digital watch!!! A compilation of pericopes in a mish mash of plots and characters strung together with a weak plot. The acting was stronger by one of the main characters Toby Stephens who plays Captain William Gordon has stood out amongst what otherwise can only be described as a B class actors. Toby will go far in the movie industry  but he would be better off sticking to Hollywood.All in all I hope the next movie that Toby Stephen plays in gives him a a better supporting role to let a potentially excellent actor shine.\tI was disappointed by this movie. And this was not because of high expectations. Considering how high the expectations of Indian movie watchers had for this movie  it could have fallen well short of expectations and still be a great movie. However  even from an objective viewpoint  ignoring all expectations  this movie is simply a bad one.Considering the makers - Aamir Khan who is known to choose work after careful consideration of the script; Ketan Mehta - who has directed some brilliant movies such as Mirch Masala  and Holi; and international and big canvas  expectations were justly quite high.There were problems with the script - no continuity  no character development; direction - which seemed to be quite inadequate in ability to get the point across  lacking control of a scene; and editing were the main culprit. Perhaps the director Ketan Mehta just got burdened/overwhelmed under the weight of HUGE expectations that arose from the first day of the announcement.A.R. Rehman's music is not bad (it is not great either)  but it is not incorporated/presented in the movie well. Never is there a situation developed that leads nicely into a song. Songs just suddenly appear - it seems almost out of nowhere.After the movie is over  one feels nothing for the Indian cause or the friendship of the two main leads. Throughout the movie one never feels anything towards any of the characters.It is surprising why the makers did not realize during the making that this movie was not developing well. In particular  being one of Aamir's sincere fans  I can tell you that Aamir's fans expect a much better movie if he has chosen to be a part of it.Please Aamir  do not disappoint us the next time. We expect you to be a better judge of the script.\tBefore I begin my dissection of this epic  let me just remind you the image Bollywood has in the west is 3 hour plus long movies with more songs & dance sequences then actual narrative or action and little storyline  if this is your image of Bollywood I strongly advise you to watch this film. A Historical epic based on true evens and real people  this really does break the mould of your typical Hindi movie. The story centres on events in 1857  during British Rule of India. Many historians believe the Indian Independence movement began here  almost 90 years before India actually received its independence from British rule. We begin the story be being introduced to the central character  Mangal Pandey (played brilliantly by Aamir Khan  a native sepoy (frontline British army soldier) working for the East India Company on behalf of the British Raj. He begins a strong friendship with his commanding British officer  William Gordon (played by Toby Stephans)  by saving him an a war with Afghanistan. The story accelerates from here introducing us to the way of life the Sepoy lives  totally loyal to the companies regime  loosing their tradition and culture. When the Sepoy's are asked to use a new gun cartridge greased with the fat of cows & pigs (against the religions of both Hindu's & Muslims) they all face conflict within  do they go against their faith & heritage or carry on to follow the \""companies\"" rules? When Gordon promise his friend Mangal that the cartridges will not damage his faith and are not greased with animal fat  Mangal believes him and trusts his friend but also warning if the facts are false and the rumour is true he will burn the entire company down to the ground ! You have to realise when your watching this spectacle these events really happened  and India was under the rule of the British who used over 300 000 native Indians in their armed regiments to control the Indian sub continent under an iron fist  and they promised to always have their best interests at heart. When the truth emerges about these controversial gun cartridges  Magal Pandey explodes and a mutiny begins within the ranks of the sepoys  the news spread fast. The movie has some romance too with Magal falling in love with a local prostitute hired to pleasure the British soldiers  and his friend Gordon even falls for an Indian girl. The movie is well shot and has good narrative  it may not be to everyone's cup of tea as this is not your standard bollywood or even Hollywood type film  and the music is definitely a plus point to me especially the title song \""Mangal a  Mangal  a  Mangal\"". Again this won't be to everyone's taste especially when the viewer is trying to sympathise with the plight of the Indian people only to see the characters burst into song and vibrant colours thrown everywhere  but this is Indian cinema so you have to get used to I  and I loved this aspect. Overall I don't think its the cross Atlantic film that bridges the gap between American & Indian films it wants to be  trying to please Indian & western audiences is difficult especially in a historical context  but it does a good job of being a serious entertainer and definitely gave me goosebumps and made me proud of my heritage.Bollywood movies are an acquired taste  and though this isn't technically a bollywood movie with 70% of the dialogue in English  and less resonance to the viewer with no Indian roots it still is a good entertaining film worth watching as an alternative\tKudos to Aamir Khan for the dedication he put into the production of The Rising  an unfairly over-hyped film  that sets out to deliver the story of Mangal Pandey.The fact that Aamir took 4 years to make this film complete with growing his locks and that awesome moustache along with tons of research is an anomaly in the Bollywood film industry. Films are churned out 3/day at the last estimate  but Aamir being the professional he is  waited years to make this movie after the unprecedented success of his Oscar nominated Lagaan.Without a doubt Aamir carries the film on his shoulders. There were many naysayers about the fact that Aamir may have been a bit lacking in the height department for the role of a freedom fighter  but when you see his towering performance on screen  his small frame is all but forgotten.The man is Indian Cinmas answer to Edward Norton from Hollywood. A great actor for his generation who is going to continue to bring Indian cinema (not bollywood masala flicks) to the international audience....i think it's his calling. Amitabh Bachchan seems to have chickened out of this task of elevating Indian cinema to an art rather than a mockery that it usually is.Without a doubt another actor who comes close to stealing the film away from Aamir is British actor Toby Stephens... i was under the impression that his role would be quite small. Instead he has a fully fledged three dimensional character who is in the entire movie. And on top of that  he acts the entire movie in Hindi. A best supporting actor nod is in order.This film could theoretically get an Oscar nod (unfortunately a win maybe a hard sell). The songs are probably distracting for a Western audience  but they'll have to live with them.The film does fall short of being an all time classic. But i think we may have to wait for the initial hype to settle down  because the movie is without a doubt the best one of 2005.The film is slow to start  with the first half being an introduction of all the characters. But pre-interval  the story and Aamir Khan rev into the 6th gear  getting ready for the inevitable Rising post interval.Get this. I think the movie could have been a bit longer. A little more development was needed with some of the glossed over aspects of British rule.But  all in all  a magnificent effort from all involved  especially Aamir Khan and Toby Stephens.8/10\tA must see - Go watch it! Color  Music  the Human Spirit - Best foreign film ever and best movie and acting of this year! YES ITS IN English! NEEDS AN Oscar!Why am I writing a long review on the web for people I don't even know? It's the most amazing foreign made film I've ever seen! I'm a big De Niro and Pacino fan but this Indian person (logged on to check on his name) is a magnificent actor! I wonder if he's like the character he's playing in real life! He surely gives my De Niro and Pacino's something to write notes about! The story is based in India in the 1800's when they were a British colony. The story revolves around a character who becomes their first freedom fighter and is based on true history. This is no slow paced Ivory/Merchant movie and kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole length of the movie (Its almost 3 hrs. long!). Remember the Civil War movie 'Glory'? This movie (its cinematography) reminded me of that (didnt realize those Indians made such large scale movies).The Indian actor was superb - no dubbing  spoke excellent English and amazing acting! Toby Stevens plays the lead's friend and a captain in the British forces. He's the same guy from the last 007 flick. What an actor! This movie is about the human spirit - its about simple pleasures - its about the vivid colors of India. This movie is so good  its hard to explain! I've got so many thoughts in my head - the only way to know what its about is to go and watch it! Best $10 I've spent all year!!!Carla Kaczmarek Pittsburgh  PA\tI had very high expectations from this movie. It lived up to most of them. I found it to be extremely well handled{Kudos to the director Ketan Mehta}. The acting was quite brilliant and the whole movie packed a great punch. But even this time as always Aamir Khan carried the movie through and through. He was just superb. His emotion  his fanaticism and his change in the movie is just brilliantly portrayed. The movie does have its flaws. It stretches a bit towards the end. One song in particular could have been avoided. The characters have shown great depth and development. Toby Stevens as William Gordon deserves a huge applause. He has pulled off a great performance. There is a little Bollywood touch to the movie  some scenes are stereotypical. The other actors are perfectly cast. The use of songs in the movie was excellent. They are very well enmeshed into the story.Overall  I think it is an Intelligent film. I think it will be very well accepted by the masses.\tA perfect example of great hype  great actors  more money and a little of script. The pre-interval of the movie is quite boring with lots of song and dance sequences and little of substance. The characters one after the another is brought into the film but the movie still remains at the same position. Worse is the voice-over which after sometime becomes a bit irritating. Rani Mukherjee is wasted in the role as Heera. Less said of Amisha Patel the better. Even if one removes both the characters  there's isn't going to be any difference in the movie. Could have been a better movie had more focus on the revolt was stressed.Goof ups: In Indian version of the movie  when the Rangoon Regiment comes  the person leading the regiment is shown speaking in Hindi to his British soldiers.\tI couldn't wait to watch this movie.but now i regret wasting my time and energy i spent watching this steaming pile of crap The director seems to have no idea about what he is doing  he is all over the place.The editing is abrupt and just simply ridiculous  they have taken an important event in Indian history and turned it into a badly made bollywood masala movie. The sets seem to come out of a high school play. There is no weight for any of the characters. You feel nothing for them. All of them feel so fake and empty. Amir Khan did a fairly "
March of the Penguins (2005),"Greetings again from the darkness. This documentary had two effects on me. First  the photography and scenery is stunning. Second  penguins seem to have survived despite their lack of evolution. The magic of Antarctica is captured beautifully. The stark ice desert is amazing in its isolation and brutal environment. For whatever reason  for thousands of years emperor penguins have made this same trek at exactly the same time of year to exactly the same place for the sole purpose of procreation. This isolated spot provides relief from most predators but causes incredible hardships on mother  father and chick penguins. I am no scientist  but it is a real head scratcher as to why this creature does something so difficult for them and has made no strides towards a simpler or more effective method after all this time. As a movie watcher  I definitely enjoyed the amazing photography as the rituals of marching  mating and surviving are captured on film - including some terrific close ups of these flightless birds. The photography overcomes what is a horrible score and less than exciting narration from the normally outstanding Morgan Freeman. Still worth seeing  although kids under age 8 will undoubtedly be bored. This one will keep you from ever feeling sorry for zoo-kept penguins again!\tA lot of good things have been said about this movie along with some negative things. Overall I was very pleased with it. As always there are things that might have been done better but if they had been done the other way people would still have complained.I had great admiration for those who went on location. Even with all of the modern survival equipment that must have been a grueling time. The slightest mistake could mean death. I've worked with people who have gone to the far north and they tell me how quickly one could freeze to death by a simple mistake.What struck me most was listening to comments as I left the theater. Various people were commenting on how Anartica was at the *north* pole. As I hope most people here know  it is at the south pole. Also the breeding grounds were not at the pole itself but were within the antarctic circle (peroid without any sun at all). Another  more understandable error I saw in published reviews was a reference to the aurora borealis. Those are the northern lights. The commenter correctly called them the southern lights which are also known as the aurora australis. BUt I really had trouble biting my tongue as I overheard one woman teaching the young children with her that the penguins lived at the North Pole.ON the positive side  I learned a lot from just watching. In the past I've mostly seen penguins in still pictures or briefly at a zoo. BUt watching them in motion and doing things  I was struck by how truly birdlike they are. We have parakeets and the was a lot of resemblance in the way they move their head and do other things between the little parakeet and the giant emperor penguin.\tI loved this movie. The visuals are amazing and I never knew what the Emporer Penguins went through to find a mate and become parents. It makes me realize how truly amazing these penguins are and how disappointing we are. The G rating does miss the real point of them. There was so much left unexplained due to the harshness of Mother Nature. I feel a certain anger knowing how much pain can be caused to these little creatures  so innocent and so pure. I must say  if the director would of focused in more on this  I don't think many people would have been able to sit through the movie. I know I would of probably cried my eyes out. It's funny  I can sit through any horror movie and have seen real human death  but this  like the baby harp seals  is very hard on the soul. The difference being the penguins are not hunted by humans  some of them in this movie suffer such pain that's almost sadistic and makes me want to scream at some higher power for letting this happen. We humans can learn a lot from these Penguins  I know I have.....................\tFor a movie to be cinematically successful  it must generate emotions in the viewer. This documentary is laden with drama but falls short in one critical area - the soundtrack. It took about 20 minutes for me to figure this out. All of this wonderful scenery with a story of heroic proportions and a cast of thousands - and maudlin music. Leaving the theater  I couldn't help thinking how better it would have been with a score by Vangelis or even James Horner ( who could have gone back to Sibelius for more material ). A lost opportunity in my opinion.And yes  I too kept thinking about the hardships of filming in such environs and look forward to the \Making of...\""\tThis is the beautiful story of a group of penguins living in Antarctica that make several long journeys to get to their breeding ground. It follows these penguins as they give birth to chicks and then bring them up. At the beginning this movie goes slowly  and young children may get bored  but as soon as you see the adorable penguin chicks  it will be hard to take your eyes off the screen. It is really touching to see these penguins walking 70-80 miles for the sake of their children  bearing extreme temperatures. The whole family will find this entertaining  but young children may be disturbed by the pictures of dead penguins and hawks eating penguins. Overall  this is an amazing movie with remarkable footage  something that you won't want to miss.\t(This is a comment on the US version.)I greatly enjoyed March of the Penguins  and not just because I'm a huge fan of the birds. I'm also a huge fan of Morgan Freeman  and his smooth (near-hypnotic) voice-over matched the pacing of the film wonderfully. I won't add a review of the movie per se (you can judge from the comments of others)  but I'd like to comment on the audiences. I'm afraid that  normally  respectful audiences are in short supply in my town. However  the folks lining up to see this movie have been well-mannered and quiet  even the little ones. This must truly be a family film: I've seen three generations in some groups! Round up the whole family  you're not going to see something like this in the theaters for a long time to come.\tIn my childhood years  I loved watching documentaries on tape from National Geographic  especially on wildlife. I was always fascinated in how those in the wild (and the endangered as well) go through life  how they eat  how they struggle and persevere  how they mate  etc  and the craft behind the documentaries was equally fascinating. March of the Penguins  which is the first documentary in this vein that I've seen in many a moon  is no exception. While for many who aren't (or weren't) big on those documentaries or the Discovery channel or other may wonder what's the point in a film about penguins  for a particular audience it's like candy that doesn't really rot your mouth. It's simple storytelling  and it creates a kind of spell on those who find animals interesting. I'm sure those who love penguins will make this a must-see event of the summer.There isn't a \""plot\"" really  but as the narrator takes us through the story (here being the instantly recognizable Morgan Freeman)  we learn how the Emperor Penguins deal with life on the surface of Antarctica. They come up to breed  and then lay their eggs and bring up their young  but their struggles are many- the deathly  way below-zero cold  the arduous walk across the tundra to feed  and the care that must be taken with the chicks when they're hatched. All of this is done in almost a mini-epic kind of way  and director Luc Jacquet (and his DPs Laurent Chalet and Jerome Maison) does some amazing visuals. Although many who see the movie won't take it much into account (and it's sort of taken for granted)  the cinematography is crucial for a film like this  and on that level the film works on levels that match up and even surpass the documentaries I watched as a child. After a while  I almost forgot there was tough craft in this  which is also remarkable- that they were able to film these creatures in this environment  without being too obtrusive  and make it seem cinematic.For all ages  March of the Penguins is a little gem in a summer flooded with remakes and sequels  and the fact that it's becoming the sleeper hit of the season (it's reportedly made more per-screen than War of the Worlds) is equally surprising.\tI have to admit that the March of the Penguins was a pretty big disappointment. Morgan Freeman's English-language narration is dull and uninspired. The best narrations are those that don't call attention to the personality of the narrator  but leave you waiting for the credits to find out \""who was that guy?\"" In this case  though  it was impossible to do other than to recognize Freeman's voice at every turn. The tone of his narration is too low  his presentation too dull  and the lack of any sense of enthusiasm in his voice was unfortunate in such an otherwise interesting film. The penguins deserved better.Worse than that  though  was the jarring electronic music that accompanied Freeman's narration. At times the sound was so loud that Freeman's words were hard to understand. When you imagine how much better a classical score would have been the music in this film seems egregiously bad.Some of the photography in the film was marvelous  though is it really something we haven't seen before? I'm sorry to be so negative about this March of the Penguins. It's not a really bad film  just disappointing. Or maybe I'm just suffering from emperor penguin overload.\tThis is a very good film. Actually a great film  A MUST SEE! I usually don't see documentaries but this one looked very good. The beginning scenes where an introduction  from that the story begins.... The penguins marching to there mating ground. When they finally get there they try to find a mate and get babies. As I said in the Summary  A Very Good Film but.... the movie had a lot of deaths and they say it is a family movie. The life of Penguins is very complicated and I wouldn't want to be one. If you want to see this film fine  but it is not for younger kids  mostly for adults and kids who won't be sad about death. Well I give March of the Penguins 2 Thums UP!!!!\tCompare your life to an Emperor Penguin's and I guarantee you that your's is probably easier. Eight months of the year is dedicated to delivering one new chick and four months of the year is dedicated to eating and not being eaten. In an icy wasteland  to boot.I learned a lot about the little guys (and gals) and the arduous process of bringing a baby chick to life and keeping it alive. They don't all make it.It's very gratifying to see the ones that do make it and it gives us hope. The cinematography is beautiful  the texture of the penguins' feathers and the tender way the mated pairs treat each other. And the little penguins are cute.\tMarch of the Penguins is an incredible movie covering a year in the life of emperor penguins. It begins with penguins surfacing from their home in the sea to find a mate. The movie covers this mating process from conception to when the baby penguins are left on their own. Narrated by Morgan Freeman  we see the hardships the penguins have to face for reproduction. Sometimes either the male  the female or the new baby will die due to the weather or predators. The risk the penguins have to take is often more compelling than some other movies I have seen this year. If you want to see something different late in the summer (I know I have)  then this is the movie for you. This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year.\tThis is a movie to see if you want to get cold. I live in Arizona  and it was 110 the day I went to see it. I am not kidding when I say that I felt a little cold. I heard that theaters are turning the temperature down 10 degrees to add a more real effect. It worked. I had no idea that Penguins froze to death. There were many things I didn't know about PENGUINS I was amazed that they are so family oriented. Tedd should see this. It's probably too devoid of action for Jake. But I still think he should see it. He lives in Las Vegas and eats meals.I want to make it very clear that this movie does show some very horrible scenes in which mother nature's predatory thing kicks into action. I know  it's hard. OK  time for me to go to the gym.\tDull... Dull... Dull. How do movies such as these gain widespread distribution in COMMERCIAL theaters? My advice: steer the kids way clear of this  and if their heart is set on it... feign convulsions. A brief synopsis: Penquins marching. Ice. Wind. Ice. Snow. Ice. Penguins dancing. Ice. Eggs. Ice. Cold. Hunger. Ice. Marching. Hunger. Ice. Marching. Predators. Ice. Notice a pattern? And on the upside when your kids say I could have seen that on animal planet... you can throw them to your shoulders and offer a quiet: \""yup\"". Not the worst movie I've payed 9 USD to see  but surely in the running. But on the flip side  if seeing animals do their thing is your thing  then this... \""thing\"" might be for you.\tEmperor penguins in Antarctica struggle with the harsh elements and flying predators as they attempt to breed and get food to survive. Director/co-writer Luc Jacquet's National Geographic documentary feature has loads of heart and personality. In this day and age of rotten and unremarkable characters in movies  Jacquet's little tuxedo birds share their trials  triumphs  tragedies and tribulations with no strings attached. Harrowing narration by Morgan Freeman (for the American version) tells the heartwarming and often heartrending treks that these magnificent animals must take each year for their very survival. A haunting score (one of the better of recent memory) and top-notch cinematography are more than enough reason to give this picture a try. Likely will be more of a curiosity than a classic  \""March of the Penguins\"" is nevertheless a fascinating and endearing experience that has that special unspeakable quality that few movies have. 4 stars out of 5.\tCaught this movie last night  and while it's definitely a fascinating  great-looking documentary  I must say I'm a little surprised that this is the same movie that cracked into the Box Office Top Ten! It's a great story  and just getting it all on film is an accomplishment  but why penguins? The animal world has hundreds of amazing survival stories happening across the globe at any minute- which makes me wonder  again  how one cute movie about penguins- which isn't much more impressive than your average National Geographic special- could have such a big theatrical audience. Maybe this is just a result of Fahrenheit 9/11's success- maybe studios are pushing docs more than before. These are two very different movies  but the success of Michael Moore's docs might just be opening the door to more non-fiction movies  and in that way  the wide release of March of the Penguins could just be the studio testing the waters with a family-friendly film.\tBest movie of the year thus far. March of the Penguins seems to be your typical documentary  with beautiful shots of landscape and the prerequisite close up shots of our waddling Antartican friends. No  this \""documentary\"" tugs at your heart with the truth that is presented on screen. Watching everything that the Emperor penguin goes thru to perpetuate their species puts the whole world into perspective. I will see this movie again and again and will be the first to purchase the DVD when it comes out (whenever that will be). You owe it to yourself to give this movie a chance. It's great for all ages. you'll laugh and cry and gasp and sigh.\tNext time you complain about how cold winter is  think about how Luc Jacquet spent his summer. He and his crew went to Antarctica  the most brutally cold place on Earth  where they braved temperatures below -80* (without the wind-chill)  to film the mating habits of Emperor Penguins. Every March (fall in the southern hemisphere)  all of the Emperor Penguins leave their homes on the shores of the coldest landmass and march single-file to an area about 70 miles away. This is the breeding ground at which all of them were born.In some ways  they are like us. The males stand around and strut their stuff while the females choose their mate. Once the couples are decided  their lives are focused solely on procreation and keeping the egg alive. After the female lays the egg  however  she passes it to her mate--the videography is unbelievable!--and then travels 100 miles or more back to the shore to eat. The males stay at the breeding ground to care for the egg. The females then return to the breeding ground to feed their chicks  and only then do the males go to search for food.I was amazed at the sense of family. Everything they do is for the chick. Both parents quite literally risk their lives to keep their babies alive. What amazed me most is the sense of community among the Emperor Penguins. All of the females go to the ocean as a single group  while all of the males stay in one huge huddle  rotating so that each can spend some time in the warm middle  and some time shielding the group from the -80* cold and the 100+ mph wind.You don't have to be a nature lover to enjoy \""March of the Penguins.\"" It is a story of love of family and the importance of community. The frozen desert of Antarctica captured beautifully on film. And Morgan Freeman is regal as narrator.Note: Despite the G rating  there is some material which may scare little children.\tLuc Jacquet impressively captures the beauty of the harsh climate of Antarctica. The main characters of this film are endearing not only for their stunning plumage  but also for their fortitude and dogged determination to survive in a world of adversity.This film shows impossible landscapes untread by humans- ridges  peaks and steep faces of massive glaciers that would be the envy of any seasoned mountaineer. What is a freezing and totally inaccessible world to us is home to the Emperor Penguin. This movie is a fascinating account documenting the cycles of life of this inimitable star. The lives of a colony of penguins is a story of survival that is moving  sad at times and always interesting.While this film is extremely educational it would have been nice to have had more information presented to the viewer such as a map and other statistics. The idea that this movie is a \""story of love\"" anthropomorphizes the penguins and makes the viewer feel a connection to them. I hope that other movies like this come out so that more effort will be made to conserving the habitat of the animals of the world.\tIf March of the Penguins is told in a rather conventional manner for a documentary  I'm willing to forgive it because the story behind it is so compelling. When you have a story this unusual and interesting  you can't be slowed down by things like presentation and layout. You can't make up the things that happen to these emperor penguins. As much as I hate to spread a clich\u00e9  truth is stranger than fiction in this case.The emperor penguin's sole purpose  it may seem  in life is to give birth so that their kind may live for another generation. To do this  they must travel to get to a breeding ground thick enough to support them when the ice melts in spring. Before they reach this safe ground  they will have traveled over seventy miles. Keep in mind that they do not travel this distance by air (as they are a flightless bird) or by sea- but on foot. When they have arrived  the thousands of penguins pair up and begin to mate. Sometimes it seems that something as simple as another penguin's call is enough  but it is most likely their method of selecting a suitable partner is based on a criteria we cannot possibly understand.Once the penguins have given birth  ownership of the egg is switched from the female to the male. This reversal of gender roles in the natural kingdom is not unique to penguins (if I remember correctly  the male sea horse is the one who actually gives birth)  but it is interesting nonetheless. So as the male penguins brave blizzards that can be up to 150 degrees below zero while holding the egg under a flap of skin  the females walk back to the sea to collect food for themselves  and more importantly for their baby. As we are told  the penguins who do not return actually result in two casualties: the mother penguin and that of her newborn chick.Like the chicks who are eventually forced to swim without ever having seen the sea before  their journey to the breeding ground is an instinctual feeling  an evolutionary process so oft-repeated by their ancestors that it has been drilled into their head. The fact that these penguins are traveling over seventy miles on foot is extraordinary enough  but that they are doing so on an instinct  to a destination they have never known  is simply astounding. Try to put this in human. Many of us cannot even get to the pizza place without Mapquest in tow. How could we possibly navigate miles of Antartica land and find a small area on a feeling? If there's any one problem with the film  it's that Morgan Freeman's narration and even the soundtrack serve to further the film's tendency of emotionalism over logic. There's a scene in particular I'm thinking about  right after the female penguins feed for the first time since the march's start. As the music swells with sinister tones  we are reminded about a predatory sea lion scouring the sea floor in search of (and finds) a penguin to make its next meal. My problem with this scene is that it seems to almost look down on the sea lion. Don't get me wrong  I'm certainly rooting for the emperor penguin's extended survival  but isn't the sea lion just following nature's way as well? No  the idea that hundreds of these noble creatures will not make it back is not a happy one. But as anyone familiar with Darwin's idea of natural selection will tell you  it is for the best. That's the thing about Mother Nature: she can make something as awe-inspiring as this  but she can just as quickly take it away.And although the film does end with a sense of closure  in reality they will back again next year  and the year after that. I knew that emperor penguins mate every year  but I had always thought that penguins spent most of the year swimming  feasting  and generally acting like the polar bears from the Coca-Cola commercials and set aside one season of the year to mate. In other words  the total opposite. At any rate  this is a fine documentary about one of nature's most intriguing happenings.\tI am a huge fans of documentaries ( I watch all of the learning channels like animal planet  discovery and so on...)  and national geographic has put out many great documentaries on penguins and I must admit that there is not anything special about this one. I have seen many better documentaries on penguins and this one was not the best  but it was still a very good film. It was amazing to see some of the shots that they got in the Arctic. I do thought still suggest seeing this film because all in all it is a great show and it was great to see a show like this to make it to the theater  and I also suggest seeing winged migration if you enjoyed this film."""
Me and You and Everyone We Know (2005),"There are moments in this film that are extremely uncomfortable  dealing with children and sexuality and kids seeming headlong rush into trying to grow up way too soon. But then there are moments of sheer hilarity punctuating that. These characters are all far from perfect  but then they never act so imperfect that they become imperfections or social outcasts - it was a fine line  I sat dreading and hoping bad things weren't about to happen. The characters are disconnected  and oddly intertwined. This film felt like a guilty pleasure and sitting next to my wife who didn't laugh once made me feel all the more guilty. What punctuates these uncomfortable moments with the kid's scenes are the adult's scenes - - these adults seem more like children. In fact  the naivet\u00e9 of these adults is really a welcoming thing in this day and age of children growing up so soon. The adults view of the world reminds me of how David Byrne (of Talking Heads/True Stories) perceives the world - \pieces and parts\"" of interest  focusing on minutiae and the everyday \""stuff\""  showing the absurd in the ordinary  while never condescending to any character. I liked this film  and found myself wishing I lived in a section of Los Angeles where there was still magic in believing an anonymous stranger makes the sun rise  and \""passes the time\"".\tI was not interested in any characters or any story arc in this generic mess. Bland uninteresting people going about doing senseless illogical things should be the spate of Hollywood blockbusters like War of the Worlds. But add a New Age kind of idiocy to the proceedings and you have this intolerable film. It's like being cornered at a party by a wifty granola eating vegan who talks to you endlessly about the auras of plants. And makes about as much sense. I knew I was in trouble at the very beginning of the film as soon as the idiot lead guy who is breaking up with his wife/girlfriend says they need to have some kind of ceremony for their two boys to mark the occasion. The dip stick then pours lighter fluid on his hand and lights it. He got burned and I was glad.The chat room sex between the little boy and the anonymous person on the other end is just plain not funny. Is there supposed to be some kind of insight in the little boy saying he wants to poop back and forth in each other's butt holes? What is it with the two girls testing their fellatio technique on the very passive boy who is their neighbor? It makes no sense and develops into nothing that propels the story or the characters. Easy jokes are made about modern art  but those kinds of jokes are neither clever nor witty nor hard to do. Also  the performance artist played by writer/director Miranda July who dogs the art maven and the flaming asshole  when we finally see her \""art\""  it is of the most loathsome and stupidest kind of performance art confessional crap you can imagine. Spalding Gray is turning over in his grave at this. Pretentious  annoying and in no way satisfying like Short Cuts  Happy Endings  Mystery Train  Night On Earth or even Manhattan was. What all the fuss is about this nothing of a movie I can't fathom?Also  what did happen to the goldfish? He got smashed  that's what!\tWow I had high expectations about this film but I cant honesty give my thumbs up on this even though Miranda July looks like she gave it her all. I guess thats the sad thing about this film She tries way to hard to say something yet the problem is nothing here is worth saying. Lots of pieced together scene structure that was a product of less than good editing and uninspired writing. Didn't we all go thru that film period in the 90s where multiple story lines were a fad in Hollywood? Some of the acting like the little boy role is outstanding ( but content a bit disturbing) John Hawkes pulls off a good performance with a so so script. I guess one would have to chance this for yourself and see the film but I would wait for the DVD to take that risk...\tThis movie is so WEIRD I can't help but love it! This kind of disturbing absurdity is rarely seen outside of a Todd Solondz film. But here it is! Writer/director/star Miranda July has made a movie where every single character is either certifiably insane or simply in love. Maybe that's the point. Maybe it's supposed to show us how we're all completely out of our minds when we fall in love. No  on second thought  these people are all just total nut bags! John Hawkes stars as Richard  a single father and shoe salesman who lights his hand on fire for the pure amusement of his two sons who spend far too much time chatting online. His six year-old unknowingly has some crazy cyber sex with a complete stranger in which he details \""pooping\"" back and forth with her (don't ask). All the kids in this film are doing things they shouldn't be doing. Yes  Me and You and Everyone We Know is insane at times (okay  most of the time)  but at the heart is a beautiful love story worth checking out.\tSome funny moments  but in general  I found this movie to be absolutely pointless. 90 minutes of my life that I can't get back. The lead woman was nuts--I didn't like her and didn't care what happened with her. I went to see this film because I was told (by 2 different people) how it was a \""must-see\"". I think I need to make some phone calls...Will someone please tell me why this would be considered a \""compelling\"" movie? When it ended I sat there stunned  wondering what I had just watched.I loved the youngest boy though. I thought he did a great job  and he was just too cute for words.\tI saw this movie because I'm a big John Hawkes fan and to be honest was expecting an arty indie film  but this movie was surprisingly hilarious and poignant. It's really about our fundamental need for the regard of others  for simple human connection  and how this connection can save us  make us whole and cement our place in the universe. It takes some very surprising turns  and oddly enough  features some very wonderful performances by child and teen actors. And of course  Hawkes is wonderful  as is triple-threat writer  director and star Miranda July. Also? I've never seen a movie with a more realistic LA setting (warts and all) than this one. In all  a lovely little film.\tI used to think that there could only be one transcendent movie in a decade  or even in two. Transcendent films just don't come along very often. But here we are in the 00's  and that old belief of mine has been shattered. \""Cinderella Man\""  the best movie of the year  was the first transcendent film I'd seen this decade. I thought that was it. But then came \""Me and You and Everyone We Know\""  a magical and breath-taking and  yes  transcendent debut for writer/director/star Miranda July. I've never seen a film quite like this  and I've never seen a film that made me feel the way this one does.\""Me and You and Everyone We Know\"" is a quirky look at contemporary life. Christine is a performance artist and Elder Cab driver. Her art is unknown and her cab driving job is mostly mundane. One day she meets a lonely and confused shoe salesman named Richard. Richard is coming off of a divorce and is struggling to connect with his sons. His attempt to impress them with a pyrotechnic display badly burned his hand  and his distraction with Christine drives him and the boys farther apart. He decides to cut his connection to Christine.Richards younger son  Robby  is in the middle of an illicit internet romance with a stranger. The elder son  Peter  is fascinated by the ten-year-old girl next door  who is already preparing a dowry for a marriage she doesn't think will come for at least twenty years.Heather and Rebecca are two neighborhood girls who are the object of a perverted man's obsession. Amused  they practice sex acts on Peter before going to the dirty old man's door. They think they are mature  but learn that they are just the opposite.While watching  I was reminded of tapestry films like \""Magnolia\"" and \""Short Cuts\""  but \""Me and You\"" is different somehow. It's more realistic and personal. It's like someone actually turned the people in their neighborhood into movie characters. The people in \""Me and You\"" aren't glamorous or especially smart or funny. Their average people with average problems. This is the stuff that happens every day in the real world. We just so happen to be lucky enough to sneak a peek at a neighborhood that isn't our own.The fact that this is Miranda July's first time doing anything filmic is stunning. She brings her vision to life both in front of and behind the camera with such assurance and confidence that one could easily think she was an old hand at it. Her style of dialogue  her method of acting  and her ability to perfectly construct a scene are what most directors and actors wish they had.Take for example the scene where Christine and Richard walk down a sidewalk together. Christine talks about how the sidewalk is like the path of their relationship  and every step represents months and years. Just before reaching the end  the two separate and go their own ways  but Christine can't stop looking back over her shoulder. While it doesn't sound like much in theory  it is incredible on the screen. After you see it  you will look back and think \""that was a perfect scene.\"" It's one of the most perfect scenes ever filmed thanks to the excellent writing and direction and July's performance as Christine (credit is due to John Hawkes as well  who makes the perfect sounding board in the scene).\""Me and You and Everyone We Know\""  much like July's performance art  depicts the beauty of just being alive. It left me with a heightened sense of the beauty in the world around me  and that is something few films ever do. No other film I've seen has dared to do what this one does  and \""Me and You\"" should be lauded for that. This is the kind of film you wouldn't find in Hollywood or in you local Multiplex. It's better and more special.Miranda July is a promising talent. If she can continue on the path she has begun  she will have a long and successful career. Trust me. This film is going to get a lot of attention at the Independent Spirit Awards  and it's going to put July on the map.))<>(( FOREVER.\t\""A poetic observation of how people struggle to connect with one another in an isolating and contemporary world\"": that's how the blurb describes this movie.July herself plays Christine  an aspiring artist of the conceptual sort -- and a lonely single woman. She becomes fascinated by a shoe salesman  Richard (John Hawkes)  a father of two young boys who's just separated from his wife.Christine's day job  though she has only one known customer  is Elder Cab  a one-person driving service for old people. The customer is a seventy-something Mexican man who's just found an old lady who's the \""love of his life.\"" The theme plays out.The artist tries to connect with the shoe salesman. The two boys play at online chat rooming  and the smaller of the two winds up meeting an adult in a park. The boys give their dad the silent treatment. Two sex-crazed teenage girls tease Richard's big young bachelor co-worker and later test the older boy  giving him tandem blow jobs and asking him for a rating. \""They seemed just the same \"" he says. \""I couldn't tell the difference.\"" A little girl in the neighborhood  a bit of a snob toward Richard's \""swarthy\"" boys (their mom is African-American)  is collecting gadgets in a \""Hope Chest\"" for her future marriage. The Mexican man's girlfriend  suspecting with reason that she will die next week  cuts off the relationship. Nobody's connecting  and some of them aren't trying.A brilliant moment in the movie comes when Christine and Richard walk side by side away from the department store where he works toward where their separate cars are parked  and they pretend the trajectory of their walk marks the length of their possible relationship. They seem to have slid through this playful metaphor into dating  but Richard escapes. Christine comes back and gets in his car but he asks her to get out. The moment is allowed to pass and the charm  already shaky  dissolves. As too often happens nowadays  this scene came through best in the tighter editing of the trailer.There's some amusing satire of the art gallery world and the hoops artists have to go through to enter it. Christine's acceptance by a haughty lady gallerist on the basis of a goofy videotape monologue seems a bit far fetched. But then real life is a lot stranger and often more compelling than anything in this movie.Christine and Richard finally do date  and Christine gets to exhibit a gallery piece that celebrates the Mexican man's late girlfriend.\""Me and You and Everyone We Know\"" is a series of vignettes. There's nothing wrong with that. It works well in Jim Jarmusch films and recently did fine in \""Napoleon Dynamite.\"" The children are well cast and often droll. Richard's two glum boys are sly and appealing. Ms. July herself seems familiar  like somebody we know -- or more likely somebody we know from an inde film. But a serious weakness is that Deadwood actor Hawkes and July lack sex appeal or chemistry and their romance seems mechanical.Perhaps some of the scenes are meant to capture a child's ballooning sense of time  but there's no energy to the pacing from the adult point of view.In fact \""Me and You\"" is ultimately a somewhat nondescript product of the inde film factory. It's neither plot driven nor character driven. The characters and their situations are never allowed to just take over and flow. It tries to survive on its quirkiness but that isn't enough because there's no passion behind it. It's too arch and self conscious. It seeks not to entertain or absorb but to be cute  and that's a quality that in the absence of cute events or cute people  eventually dries up.The production of the movie  chronicled in an independent film magazine journal  gives a hint of its limitations: \""June 2001 Chicago\u0085I am writing a feature film!\"" the sequence of emails to a friend breathlessly begins. As time goes on  July's messages suggest at times she was divided between the movie project  writing a short story  and doing a performance. When the shooting starts  she's got stage fright  feels like new girl at school (\""Think of me yelling Action!\u0085..The movie is the most amazing incredible challenge of my life\u0085\"").It might have been better if this were a lot more than that. Breathlessness and pride not withstanding  \""Me and You\"" may be a personal milestone but it doesn't deserve any awards.\tWatching this movie reminded me of the Peter Sellers movie \""Being There\"". To say you liked this film would be like the characters of \""Being There\"" thinking the gardener  Chance  was a political or social genius - you would be looking for something that wasn't there. The characters in this film are all pathetic  the children are put in awful situations  the plot was slow to say the least  some of the acting was OK and there were a couple of amusing lines but nothing that would make this movie worth seeing. If you are at all curious  wait for it to come out on DVD and watch it one evening when you absolutely can't think of anything else to do. There is nothing touching or sensitive about this film. This is the first time I have felt so compelled to make a comment about a movie. I wasted my time and money; don't waste yours!\tThis film is wonderfully original and quirky. It is about adults  parents and kids struggling with the difficulties of modern life. All the characters appear lost and confused and life seems to happen to them rather than their taking initiative. All the characters seem to have coincidental connections that propel plot development. The interplay between children and adults is presented in a warm manner without being sentimental. Innocence is neither lost or betrayed. The innocent appear only to be confused by the events happening around them.This film dares to ask the question: What is the meaning of life? And answers: We don't have the slightest idea.\tI was rather looking forward to this Film. I heard great reviews about it. I saw the trailer etc. The first 25 minutes into the film I was trying to piece together what the whole of these characters were doing together.It seemed like Ms.July (she is the main character as well as writer and director) was trying to remake certain aspects of Rorbert Altmans films  where these seeming random events do have meaning in each of the characters lives but the they just lead you to wonder why in the world would she write this and what was her intent. I started getting tired then sleepy then just exhausted by watching this crazy movie. I love independent film. I have done two myself and I have to say Ms July tried to use performance art concepts in this film as a performance film itself at the expense of the audience and it just did not work for me.\tThis movie has no plot  it's just a story about screwed up people in suburbia. There really isn't much more to say as far as the plot goes. It's random  it's disturbing  it's stupid  and ultimately it doesn't make any damn sense and nothing gets explained. I haven't hated a film like this in quite a long time! And I think quite possibly this is the worst independent film I have ever seen. I went to the theater knowing nothing about the movie other then the huge array of positive reviews including Roger Ebert who claimed the film to be smart and original.What was wrong with this movie you may ask? I don't even know where to begin! First off the movie starts off by not explaining anything. Why are the parents getting a divorce? Why do the kids hate the dad? No character development at all! That's the big problem to start off with. Then they have these sick subplots like the horny child molester and the little sick kid who talks dirty to an older woman online. I mean who wrote this pile of crap! Who decides to make a scene where two little kids are talking online to an older lady in a sex chat talking about you Poop in my butt and I will poop in your butt and we will keep doing it forever. I mean was a sick 6 year old responsible for writing this script. In fact what script was there even one!? I love weird movies  I love controversial movies  I love twisted movies  but this movie is just a piece of garbage! Who would release something like this! I mean I have never seen a film that offended me so much not only because of the content but because there is no point at all. Child molesters are A-OK in this movie! An older lady talking sexual to a little 6 year old online A-OK! Why? Who knows! Nothing is explained! I do not understand what movie critics are watching when they watched this film because all I see was crap  a big pile of crap! No substance  no nothing. This isn't how suburbia is  if that's what its suppose to be  show me where that is happening in the real world  please! It's not this is garbage passed off as an art film.I have nothing at all positive to say about this film! The writer and director Miranda July should never ever be allowed to touch a keyboard or typewriter again! This is the worst pile of crap I have seen in a long time! Don't trust the critics on this one seriously! They must have been smoking crack or got paid by the studio to give this movie a positive review; there is nothing at all good about this film. This movie has no point  no morals  no story  and no direction. Nothing! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!MovieManMenzel's final rating for the hunk of crap known as Me You and Everyone We Know is a 1/10\tThis movie was no more than a dysfunctional thesis on the theme of perversion. I have seen weird  or quirky movies that were good and exhibited a degree of creativity but  this one pretty much fails in it's attempt to duplicate some it's quirky forerunners. I thought movies like \""American Beauty\""  \""Talk to her\""  \""The Secretary\""  \""Sexy Beast\""  etc.  did a much better job of marrying a touch of realism in their off-the-beaten-path scripts. This one just picked the age old worn out topic of perversion to build on. I guess as the movie progressed it perhaps improved a bit in originality and surprise. But it really didn't do anything for me. I was hoping for a bit more realism in the script. Something a bit easier to relate to.\tNow  I am a San Francisco liberal who generally appreciates independent films. I'm not easily grossed out  and I'm not easily offended. But to be blunt: this movie sucked.On one hand  I must say this film does help me to understand why the Red states hate city-liberals so much  but on the other hand I wasted $9.00.This film has no redeeming qualities. One reviewer rightfully stated that it was \""like a parody of everything bad about Indie films.\"" The children don't speak like children. The adults are pathetic and not believable.There are a couple of scenes in this movie that are in serious questionable taste  and they involve children. As much as I enjoy film as an art  I do believe you have to draw the line as to what you can and can not ask child actors to do. I don't care if they are \""acting\"" it borders on abuse.\tThis film is not for everyone. It has an ensemble cast with unmotivated characters that walk through life as if dazed in a trance. The film emphasizes the randomness in contemporary life to the extent that there is no real goal the cast shares (except maybe sex) or an antagonist hindering their achievement of it. And if no character achieves his or her desire nothing changes. The characters are never really at risk  in any believable way. And the movie moves at a snail's pace because way too many details are included that could have been edited out. Miranda doesn't really set up the love interest at all. The dialogue was as boring as casual conversation. Most scenes left me thinking \""so what? Why was that included? How does that move the story along?\"" I just finished reading a screen writing book and this movie violates most of the principles in the book  and basically proves the book right in that departing from traditional storytelling technique risks losing the audience. In conclusion  I looked at two reviews before I went and didn't see how they were talking about the same movie. Some viewers like that sort of thing. Be fore warned.\tI can't say I enjoyed \""You and Me and Everyone We Know\""  since I sat with a knot in my stomach till the credits rolled  braced for something gruesome to befall these wonderful characters I cared about. Maybe it's because so many low-budget films feature  if not glorify  society's ugly underbelly. I've been conditioned to expect negativity in my indies.Triple-threat (writer  director  star) Miranda July has done the near impossible-- she's crafted a smart  edgy  engaging film  with a brave and open heart. She's a lovely actress  in a Rachel Griffiths kind of way  with a bold-faced optimism and sincerity that leap off the screen.Her object of affection  John Hawkes (you'll know the face)  is everything a leading man is not: Awkward  angst-ridden  and utterly confused. He and July have serious chemistry; their scene along the street is pure gold.The real secret to this film is in the children's performances  all of which are captivating and totally real. These young souls are wise beyond their years  at ease in the world of adult sexuality  but utterly confused about love and intimacy  which they so desperately crave. There isn't a false note among them.\tMiranda July created a perfect picture. I knew nothing before we went in  and read only afterward that she was a performance artist and thought \""a ha\""  that explains how she achieved such True Art on Film. The picture seems so clever and adorably funny on the surface  but its lessons and beauty run to our core emotions and instincts. My husband and I walked all the way home marveling at how many gorgeous layers there are to peel away and enjoy  flavor by flavor. My favorites: The SYMMETRY: Of the storyline  the first (goldfish) and last (Ellen) eulogies. From the desperate danger of the fire on John Hawke's hand  to the comfort of the fire of the rising sun in his youngest son's eyes. The round circle of peepers tended by their mother. The perfect dialog  \""Like I'm a man in a book and you're just meeting the man in the book\"".The REFLECTIONS: the full moon in John Hawke's full moon eyes  the reflected circle spotlighting him and then how he helped her repair the mirror  how he hated the reflected words of self esteem on his ex-wife's night shirt because only the wearer can read them in a mirror. The art curator fell in love with a reflection of herself  her own words simply pasted back to her  framed by a child's most basic understanding of sex (poop) and love (back and forth  forever). The F*** spelled backwards on her windshield under the reflections of passing trees. The distorted reflections of the fish in the water bag (John Hawke is riding along a dangerous road himself) as Miranda said \""I don't know you but I love you\"" which reflect her developing feelings towards the special shoe salesman  after the empathy and insight he had shown into her undeserved (foot) pain. The passengers looking  or not looking  in their rearview mirrors at the fish on the cars.The TOUCHES: How touch changes and heals us! The old man thought a shoe salesman touching his foot \""was part of the service\""  but no \""We never touch the foot.\"" Miranda touches her three magic pink dots on her dashboard for strength  but she touches John Hawkes' squishy banana (decal) on his dash far too soon. The art curator and her assistant foolishly thinking a hamburger wrapper was sculpture because they did not dare touch it! The child's kind stroking of the art curator's hair  and the gentle knowing kiss of the woman to the child. Andrew  the other shoe salesman/neighbor says to them how wrong it is for him to touch the underage girls as he longs to  and the girls progress from applying bad makeup to kissing each other instead. And  of course  the healing touch of Miranda's pale perfect arm on the burnt hand of John Hawkes finally brings them both the sweetest peace. And their relaxation in embrace  brings peace to the viewer as well. The HOPE: The brushes with immorality that always veer back to the side of the pure. The other shoe salesman/neighbor  who could think and write about hooking up with the underage girls  but when faced with their knock on the door  he was rightfully horrified.The kindness of the older boy Peter  who was able to sense that the girls' friendship depended on him telling them they were both skilled the same (when they weren't). And his responding to the mother-peep's public denials about her Hope chest by bringing her a private gift for it  and partaking in her imaginings of loving a daughter. The boy who could have been hurt walking home but wasn't. The possible internet molestation that instead became a tender moment on a park bench. That the curator woman with Cattitude (oh what that mug said about critics and their view of art!) had no family  and dog  and dog family  to sing carols with in summertime  but she walked away from that bench happy with the strange but beautiful connection she had made... So happy that she could finally appreciate the strange but beautiful macaroni. And the RESPECT the film showed: for the young who are also sexual beings  in their way  for the single parent  for race  for the elderly  who still grow as much every day as the young: Yes  old Ellen was right  Miranda should collaborate  and it is her shared work with the old man that made it in the exhibition...... Miranda wanted to make it alone  but  like we all know  the Mayan ruins (or apartment building ruins  or family ruins) are always more beautiful with a partner. Only after Miranda the solo artist was ready to truly accept and enjoy working with someone else  and only after John's protective bandages were removed  did he call to begin their true love. Yes  the old man was right  even if the little girl saw her new goldfish die \""At least we're all in this together.\""\tI really enjoyed most of the story lines: great plots  fine writing and acting. Those involving the kids are exceptional: the psychological complexity of the characters as it emerges from their stories is startling.Nonetheless  I almost completely disliked the way the relationship between Miranda July's character and the shoe salesman unfolds. I found Christine unbearably annoying in her incessant expressions of lack of confidence in herself  as well as in her attempts to be poetic in everything she does in her life. Furthermore  the scenes where she tries to interact with the guy felt often artificial and pretentious.\tThis movie is about people trying to connect with each other  told in a very sweet  original way. It is quirky  beautiful  honest  and hilarious. The film follows the lives and dreams of many truly memorable characters  from the adorable and fascinating children to the adults with all their idiosyncrasies. I couldn't stop thinking about it the day after I saw it. I kept reliving the scenes in my head  and smiling.I am so happy to have discovered Miranda July. Not only did she write  direct  and star in this film... she is also a performance artist  has released music CDs  and is planning on releasing a book of short stories next. I'd recommend watching the trailer if you're curious. It definitely gives you a flavor of the film. If you like it  go see the movie  and you may fall in love  too. After you see it  check out the movie website (http://www.meandyoumovie.com/) and Miranda's website (http://www.mirandajuly.com/) for more great stuff.\tAnother \""this is the way we live now\"" kind of movie  here playing with notions of performance as a kind of intermediary between who we are and who we want to be. Works better than most movies of this sort  partly because director July is brave enough to give her characters an independent life  not to force her square pegs into round holes  not to become to schematic about the whole thing. Partly too because for all of the gentleness in the movie  it's never twee  or overly-filled with false little contrived character moments or epiphanies. That's a lot harder to do than it sounds: I am very impressed. The performances  particularly from the children  are first-rate: that's another thing that often seems contrived  but not here. Highly recommended."""
Million Dollar Baby (2004),"I didn't get the point of the movie! The lady becomes this great boxer then  she becomes a quadriplegic. Now she wants to die  so her coach pulls the plug. OK  I didn't find this movie entertaining at all. It had no point. You are thinking that the girl is gonna win some huge fight and the she doesn't. Oh  and her big  fat  stupid mother  I just want to clank her in the face. The boxer girl buy her mother a house  but the mother is worried about losing her welfare so she's screaming at her kid for getting her this house. This part really...whatever. That's all I have to say about the bad  Bad  BAd  BAD movie!........................................\tWhat explains the enormous interest in a sports hero? Why do sports fans set such a strong personal stake in the victories of their heroes? After all  little of any practical significance depends on such victories; a winner won't get his fans a raise or help send their children to college. Why do sports have such an enormous  enduring appeal in human life? The answer lies in a rarely recognized aspect of sports: their moral significance. What athletic victories provide is a rare and crucial moral value: the sight of human achievement.To witness the cheating and decay ruined any possible hope of seeing Million Dollar Baby's achievements. Although I was surprised Eastwood made a morally correct decision  the movie was beyond repair.\tCompared to what I normally see come out of Tinsel Town  this is wonderful. One thing though  did you notice that Dunn walks past his fighter when she is working the heavy bag  she is winded  he tells her  \you can rest when your dead\""  very ominous warning  also remember how the music became very dark and haunting when the champion comes into the ring. You just knew something tragic was going to happen. Earlier in the film Freemans character is talking about the champs style and fighting ability. They show her hitting a fighter who is on one knee  then another scene where she wrenches on the other fighters head and throws her to the ground  knocking the ref down also  they don't show her throwing elbows but she does in the fight Dunns challenger  this is very common in boxing  especially when fighters are in close throwing hooks at the head  they let there elbows follow thru where the glove would have been  anyway you would have figured that Dunn would have expected this champion to do these things again  but when she elbows  throws her shoulder and elbow to knock down her challenger  then his the fighter while she is on one knee  Dunn acts totally surprised at this and stares at her corner  then the fatal blow after the bell was horrible  it just seemed odd that Dunn didn't tell her to expect very dirty tactics and never take her eyeball off that woman at any moment. Although Dunn did tell his fighter to fight dirty right back as soon as he realized there was no getting around it. Everybody who watched that film up to that point was ready for Dunns fighter to become champion and live happily ever after  not so  and the way the movie leaves the fight game  with nothing from the other boxer or any kind of closure to the championship fight  nothing  not one thing  just a quadraplegic who asks her only friend to allow her to expire  thats tough stuff.\tOkay  after I saw this movie last night I thought it was an awesome movie  but as an avid sports fan was very disappointed in the boxing errors (as were many others on this board). The errors I speak of are- people getting punched when they are down  after the fight  etc. (basically all the cheap crap that went on  that would never happen in real boxing without the boxer being disqualified). However  after thinking about this movie over the past 24 hr.s there is one scapegoat. I was thinking back  and realized that this entire movie was through the eyes of Eastwood's daughter (who is reading the letter). The unrealistic things that happened during the boxing matches could have just been her interpretation of what she was reading. For example  Freeman's character said  \""she was known as the cheapest fighter in the ring. Eastwood's daughter may not know a lot about boxing and may have taken that as throwing people down  punching people when they are down  etc. This could also explain Swank's \""over the top\"" family that other posters were complaining about- saying that Eastwood shouldn't have been so over-dramatic with how redneck they were. All of this may have also been exaggerated by Eastwood's daughter's interpretation of what Freeman wrote in the letter. If you've read this post  what do you think? Any possible truth to this? If not  then the movie is just a bad boxing movie  and the makers should have done a better job of their homework on the boxing rules.\tMarvelous. Outstanding. The only thing I can find wrong is the film's title...MILLION DOLLAR BABY. This is a drama that packs a punch. Clint Eastwood directs and stars as Frankie Dunn  a cautious and wise gym owner and former boxing manager. His gym is managed by one of his former fighters Eddie 'Scrap Iron' Dupris(Morgan Freeman). Their lives take on a new perspective when a thirty-something waitress Maggie Fitzgerald(Hilary Swank)comes to the gym hoping to find a manager and trainer to help her escape poverty by becoming a boxer. Maggie and Eddie are convincing enough to change Frankie's mind about training a woman for the ring. Maggie proves to have the determination and the punch to become an acclaimed fighter. The fighting scenes are well choreographed and exciting. This emotional  powerful story has an unexpected and heart rendering finale. Eastwood  Swank and Freeman are excellent. Also in the cast: Jay Baruchel  Lucia Rijker and Mike Colter. This movie deserves every one of its accolades.\tI do not know how to begin praising this movie. The plot was amazing and it goes very deep. The relationship between the characters is just so real that I felt like I was taken into the movie myself. I felt like I was there actually watching everything happen. I've never been interested in boxing  but this was okay because the movie was about so much more than the sport. It was obvious to see that Hilary Swank's character  Maggie was not a failure even though she wound up on the floor after fighting for the winning title. She won because she achieved what she wanted to achieve in life  and there aren't many people who can be satisfied with that. This movie can teach us all something about life and how to appreciate it and though many may find the message behind the movie clich\u00e9  I don't think it could be emphasized enough since we all forget how to appreciate life over and over again.The acting was amazing. Clint Eastwood  Hilary Swank  and Morgan Freeman work so well together  and I had no reason to be displeased with how they acted out their roles.Warning: If you have not yet watched the movie  do not read the next paragraph. It will ruin the ending for you!!The only part of the movie which confused me was when Frankie pulls the cord. Isn't this illegal and immoral to some people? I'm not sure if he should have done this. The movie was really good so I'm not going to dwell on this. It's just that he developed such a fatherly relationship with Maggie and it's kind of odd to see him make the choice he makes. Anyway  the movie earns about a million stars from me  but since I can only give it 10  I guess that will do.\tI would give this a 10 if it filled in a few more gaps for me but the movie would have been 4 hours long if it did. Hilary Swank was fantastic in this and you can't help but fall in love with her attitude  determination and unselfishness. Clint was perfect in this role  he reminded me of my grandpa  angry at the world in his own lovable way. My biggest criticism is that they don't go into enough of his past to explain him. Morgan Freeman plays perfectly right along side Clint and they do a great job playing the roles of long time friends. There is a magical touch to this film that is indescribable  you can feel the connection between the characters and you feel like you are watching something real. Unfortunately the ending leaves you a little down and incomplete. I think they could have cut that shorter and spared me the long drawn emotional pain. All in all it was a great film and definitely worth your time.\tI thought I was going to see THE movie of the year. Must have been a bad year.Aside from the factual inaccuracies of the portrayal of a quadriplegic woman  the stereotypical \""white trash\"" family  the cartoonish boxing  and the ridiculous \""Danger\"" character  it was OK.In the end  the movie proves to be a cheap political statement  and sends a terrible message in the process. I was paralyzed from the shoulders down at age 18. I'm not on a ventilator as Swank's character is  but I am totally dependent on others for feeding  dressing  etc.This movie just perpetuates the myth that sustaining such an injury leads to a meaningless life. Swank can choose between school and death  and she chooses death. Thank you for setting the disabled community back a few more years.What have I done differently? I've gone to college  lived on my own  and work as a respected journalist in the community. Where is the story about someone like me? Why does every disabled person in a movie have to be a punchline in a joke or depressed and angry? For the record  my feelings about the message don't have any bearing on my feelings about the quality of the film. It just wasn't that great.My opinion is the only reason it received such acclaim is a) Clint Eastwood  and b) it deals with a controversial subject. We know Hollywood loves to wax on political issues. If you watch this movie  please realize that the depiction of Swank as a quadriplegic is poorly researched. Hit me up if you want to know what it is really like.\tI think (strange but I do) this movie is a good movie for its realism  and it's not really a movie which you could put the Hollywood's brand on  because something has been solved (the discovering of a legendary \""National Treasure\"")  but describes a real rough situation  where mostly everyone of us has passed in life  even unconsciously. I believe this is a good movie. But I don't think is helpful in any teachings. It may tell us how a simple and mostly lonely man can deal with the toughest decision. But after that anyone of us may just get out of the theater hoping not to go through anything like that. That is the defeat of our era. Probably Eastwood has been so great in singling out this fat worm in our shiny apple. Because the ones who come out of the theater thinking the movie had a serene (maybe melancholy but serene) ending  probably didn't get there is tragic situation in the end  a continuous remorse which will always knock on everyone's door  and the only question is \""how can we prevent it?\""I don't know if Eastwood wanted people to question about themselves  probably He just wanted to show us in reality there are some really uneasy human case.\tWe never really get to know the boxer in this film  she remains to the end a one-dimensional caricature and Eastwood's character was entirely unlikeable throughout. Freeman's narration was too eerily similar to Shawshank Redemption and seemed to have no real importance to the overall story  along with the rest of the gym's boring denizens.Although Swank does a good job with the material she is given  her dialogue never seems to transcend \""oh golly gee boss.\"" She is a great actress and was breathtaking in Boys Don't Cry  but in this - she was cardboard. What was her attraction to boxing and to Frankie Dunn? Who knows. Who cares. Apparently  that was incidental to the story.Evil Germans  stupid White Trash  a saintly janitor  and a boxer that rises to the top in 1 year with barely any training - where have we seen this all before? This is a pro euthanasia movie that doesn't even make an attempt to show the other side. The Eastwood character unilaterally takes the law into his own hands without due process or legal recourse and murders the boxer. Sickening and not a good message after the Terri Schaivo debacle. I wonder how much of the hype for this movie is out of political motivation for its seedy message.The unrealistic boxing  the grating narration  the nasty priest  the meaningless sideshow characters  and the hackneyed clich\u00e9s that riddled the film seem in the end to have all been mere plot vehicles to depict how wonderful euthanasia is. If that is the case  shame on you Clint.Clint Eastwood has great talent and his Mystic River was an excellent movie but he can't seem to get past his Dirty Harry persona. I've seen enough of it already but apparently most people haven't judging by the undeserved awards this film garnered.This is the most over-hyped mediocrity since American Beauty. 20 years from now it will be entirely forgotten.\tThe story of a white trash early 30s woman (Swank) determined to be a good boxer and the veteran coach (Eastwood) who reluctantly takes her on board. The tale is narrated by Eastwood's gym buddy Freeman.Solid direction from Clint  and a surprisingly good acting performance from him too. Swank does nothing wrong  and Freeman brings his usual trademark quiet dignity to his role. The story is simple. Swank surprises everyone with her boxing talent  Eastwood develops paternal feelings towards her and the two of them strike a father-daughter relationship. Swank's lack of a father figure in her life  and her clearly trashy family makes her relationship with Eastwood whose own daughter is estranged from him all the more relevant.Alas in time Swank gets bested by a top hardcore boxer  and she has to contend with her shattered dreams. Taking a philosophical angle  she contents herself with the thought that despite her career ending defeat and serious injuries she lived a lot more and made more of an impact in her world than she would have if she never got into boxing. Better to live a couple of years with intense passion than a lifetime as trash.Freeman won his long overdue Oscar  but this again highlights that Oscars are not about the best performances or best pictures. He is as usual good in his role  but he has given more impacting performances in more demanding roles in the past. Somewhat ironic then that he should win his first Oscar for this one.There is the obligatory sideline goings on at the gym  which feel a bit contrived. However Eastwood's direction is very good  and the three principal leads know what they are doing.My issue with the film's best picture win is less a criticism of the quality of the film than the politicking going on at the Oscars. Simple effective films like this have won in the past (like Ordinary People deservedly in 1980  Terms of Endearment undeservingly a couple of years later). But the best picture winner must feel like the best picture of the year. That Million Dollar Baby ain't. Eastwood has obviously built up a web of alliances in Hollywood  and is one of it's most influential figures.I suppose the fact that this film won Best Picture shouldn't be particularly surprising. Almost everyone knows that the Oscars are not about the best. It's about what looks good  what reflects the style and power play of Hollywood the best.\tAm I the only one who thinks Million Dollar Baby is a terrible movie? It won best film  best director (Clint Eastwood)  best actress (Hilary Swank) and best supporting actor (Morgan Freeman) at the Academy Awards. (And all four Oscars were prominently displayed during the cast interview.) I'd avoid plot spoilers for those who haven't seen it  but the plot is so clich\u00e9d  thin and predictable  I can't offer guarantees.The only change to the old poor-boy-makes-good-boxing formula is that it's a poor girl this time.Hilary Swank is pretty good and the boxing scenes are fairly well choreographed  but neither are good enough to rescue the movie from dreary predictability. The direction is marginally competent in places  and I even think I spotted Clint act at one point. Otherwise  his caricature of a bitter old grouch was simplistic and one-dimensional.But neither Swank's efforts  nor Morgan Freeman's characteristic likability  could save the movie from a premise that is such a tired old workhorse that I'm surprised anyone bothered with it. It's a politically-correct Rocky rehash.Apparently  it made everyone who read the script cry  so that justified making it. Well  I cried during The Champ. But that was 30 years ago.This was pure self-indulgence on the part of Clint Eastwood. The grand question that tears at his soul was the cherry on top. \""Look how strong and moral and basically good I am!\"" It was shot in 37 days. That shows. Even the screenwriter said he was surprised that his first draft was shot. He wouldn't have done that  and he would have been right not to. There were a loose ends all over the place  implausible scenarios (you'd think fingerprints in the hospital ward would have been an issue)  and a lot of stock scenes that could have done with some disguise.And how about that pukey guy talking to Eastwood  Swank and Freeman on the DVD cast interview afterwards? I'd be embarrassed to be interviewed by such a fawning fool. \""I know I shouldn't say 'genius'  but *sigh* GENIUS *faint*\"". It was creepy.Swank made the only worthwhile contribution  both in her effort in the role  and in commenting afterwards that the movie did something for female boxers. It's not all just crude trailer-trash violence  and some of these women deserve a bit of respect - and self-respect.But other than that  it was a load of codswallop. A waste of money. I give it three out of ten  as a consolation prize to Swank. Clint Eastwood - of whom  incidentally  I'm a big fan - gets nada.\tThis is such a great movie because it's not about just boxing. It's a father-daughter love story. You have an old trainer who dosen't have anybody- not even his fighters. Then you have a the nobody who's dosen't have any one either. You get so sucked into this movie that you don't feel like your watching a movie--its all real. But not even the greatest movie buff in the world couldn't have seen the ending coming. The boxing in the movie is great  but it's that ending that makes you realize this isen't like all the other movies--it's more  because it makes you rethink your views and opinions but at the same time doesn't tell you what to think.\tMillion Dollar Baby is a boxing movie with a twist. It's a treat to see three great stars (Eastwood  Swank and Freeman) all hitting their marks. This has to be Clint Eastwood's greatest performance on screen and he directs with the level of excellence that we've come to expect. Hillary Swank proves that she deserves to be a 2 time Academy Award winner and gives an unforgettable performance. Morgan Freeman is basically himself  which is always a good thing and earned his long overdue Oscar. This is not so much a boxing movie about bravado  but it has as much heart as any sports movie ever made. This one will stay with you long after the closing credits. Not to be missed.\tI read a lot of reviews on million dollar babe and i havan't read on bad yet and i hope i'm never going to read one bad on this movie.This movie is probable the best movie of 2004.Clint Eastwood did a very good job directing this movie.If Clint is planning on stopping directing movies or acting in movies  million dollar babe should not be the last one.All i can say about this movie is the acting of this entertaining movie.The acting in this movie could'nt be any better except for Maggie Fitzgerald's (Hilary Swank) family members  Earline Fitzgerald (Margo Martindale)  Mardell Fitzgerald (Riki Lindhome).Those two actors wasn't that great in this movie but it still made a very good movie.\tIn honor of its recent release to DVD  I have chosen Million Dollar Baby to review. Never have I had so many ask me about a single film  \""Josh  is it good? Should I buy it? Is it worth it?\"" After telling them how great it is  I usually tell them that I called it back in January when I was walking out of the theater and said to my dad  \""That's gonna win best picture pops.\"" (He smartly agreed with his great prophet son\u0085OK  so maybe not great  but a proved prophet by that statement\u0085haha) Clint Eastwood directs and stars as Frankie Dunn  the spiritually lost and hard nosed boxing manager of many successful men. Hillary Swank  who won best actress for her portrayal of Maggie Fitzgerald  battles through poverty and a trashy family to finally get Dunn to manage and train her. Morgan Freeman also offers his much welcomed services as Eddie Dupris  which he also took home an Oscar for best supporting actor.As Ron Howard did with Cinderella Man  Clint Eastwood brings a contender from the pits of a metaphorical hell in order to contend for the ultimate dream\u0085becoming world champion in professional boxing. In a special twist  it is the women's division of boxing  instead of the over-used men's division. The boxing ring works as a sanctuary for the character's  keeping them from an outside world that seems to bring them nothing but bad news (I don't think Freeman's character leaves the gym once in the film).\""Baby\"" is a film filled with Eastwood's Dirty Harry attitude that is meant to cover up a sensitive heart and caring man. The interaction between the cynical trainer Frankie and hard working Maggie can be so comical that you sometimes forget you are watching a serious drama. The comic relief along with the tough decisions we must make in life play well in this most deserving winner of the Best Picture of the year for 2004.\tAbout Clint Eastwood's last movie I'd heard it was something we had seen a million times; very clich\u00e9. I don't pretend to get inside the story  because I shouldn't tell much of it  but it is  with a simple look  what we've already seen in \""Rocky\""  and maybe in \""Karate Kid\""; two classic movies of the genre. But Clint Eastwood doesn't dig the classic  he digs the proper; and the fact of not winning the awards he won this year with \""Mystic River\"" is intriguing. And \""Million Dollar Baby\"" won them not because of its relation with other films  but on its own right.The emotional power this movie has and many other things  are comparable to the equally good \""Mystic River\"". The thing is Eastwood knows how great he is and he closes with the credits in white; simple  over the black screen in both films. Anyway  \""Million Dollar Baby\"" is another movie  and if it entered late in the radar  it didn't matter because Eastwood knew what he had in his hands and what it would be  more than anyone.Again he looked for stories that excellent screenwriters would adapt (Brian Helgeland the last time  now Paul Haggis)  composed the music and produced his piece. However he is not proud  and if one doesn't know what is to see  finds out about all this in the end. This round  he added an habitual detail in his directions  that turned down a couple of years ago  but concluded now in another Oscar nomination: his performance in the movie. Between the darkness and the lights sow well handled under his lead  I was able to see some faces that spoke for themselves  and acted. The pro was also thrilling in the beautifully written chats Frankie  his character  shared with Scrap (played by Morgan Freeman). With a lot of knowledge  both men exchanged words as the figures they are and as their characters  friends who have been giving each other support since always  and know that's not going to change  so they're not afraid of honesty. These chats turn out to be between the film's best moments.Clint directed and acted in top form  without forgetting about the partners around him. In Hilary Swank he saw the love and commitment with acting  getting the best of her  en what is more than a transformation. The transformation is part of the commitment  but the love enters in knowing how to use it  because: What good does a transformation has if it won't be taken advantage of? Completing one of the best ensemble works I've seen since...Well  since \""Mystic River\""  Morgan Freeman played his cards once again  narrating and talking wisely to receive the Oscar he should have had over a decade ago for \""The Shawshank Redemption\""  were he was splendid.The way Clint Eastwood has to escape from the obvious (a man who directed lots of westerns  which are pretty obvious)  can be seen clearly in all those moments where you're waiting something typical and his camera  or his movie's script  doesn't give it to you. In \""Rocky\""  the man trained by himself  and felt proud of that; in \""Million Dollar Baby\""  our girl is in desperate need for one only trainer  and besides being proud of  loves him. It's amazing how he loves her back.\tI thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Great acting  with a few of mini plots surrounding the main plot. The tail of a boxing trainer who through experiences in life does not like to take chances decides to take one more. The trainer has not had contact with his daughter in many years and his continued pursuit of contacting her is constantly rejected. The movie just gives us a small piece of why the trainer's does not have a relationship with his daughter  but this let's the viewer ponder one of the many reasons it happened. He takes his big chance on a girl...who he would not train because of her sex for months. I get the portrayal as this is the relationship with his daughter he never had. The girl's family is lazy  greedy  self-centered people whose only concern with the girl fighter is how much money can she give them. So two peas in a pod are matched with each being quite stubborn. Somehow the relationship blooms. The cautious trainer and fighter take a great ride to the title fight. The end is one of those life searching decisions most of hope never to have to make. Yet a decision the trainer has to make...life or death. I strongly caution parents this film is not for children 17 and under. It is loaded with profane language. I would have rated the film R instead of PG-13 and if not for my TVG devise I would not have let my 13 year old watch.\tOne of the most frustratingly disappointing movies I've seen in recent years  especially given the critical reviews  its academy award for best picture  and the quality cast.On the plus side: it is a technically well-made film with good acting  as one would expect from the people involved. It also does a nice job (mostly in the first half of the film) of presenting the boxing gym as a microcosm in which a diverse group of people at very different points in their lives struggle with the demands of boxing for individual reasons. It's too bad this wasn't the main focus of the film.On the negative side: (WARNING: spoilers ahead!) This is what is sometimes referred to as a \""kill the kitten movie.\"" It presents an innocent and almost too good to be true character that the audience will care about and root for (the kitten)  and then has something terrible happen to that character (the kitten gets hit by a car). The audience is of course deeply moved by the tragedy  which creates the illusion of powerful drama when it is really just cheap  generic manipulation. In this case  the Hillary Swank character is a beautiful  plucky  brave  generous  determined young woman from an impoverished background who has not a single fault (even her teeth are movie star perfect despite her family genetics  poor upbringing and boxing career). So  the screen play has something really bad and really unfair happen to her to evoke \""kill the kitten\"" emotions. Unfortunately  not only is the tragic turn in the movie manipulative  it's also highly illogical. While the incident occurs in a public sporting event significant enough to have a large audience and to be televised  and involves a felonious act by an at least marginally famous athlete  there is no media follow up to the event  and no holding the perpetrator legally or financially responsible for the consequences. Then  the seriously injured victim is sent to 2 different medical facilities in which she never receives any counseling for the psychological trauma she's going through  and is placed in a medically inappropriate bed (I know whereof I speak) that results in terrible and unnecessary pressure ulcers that add to her woes. Finally  to evoke even more visceral responses  the movie resorts to playing on what it apparently considers to be \""acceptable\"" prejudices. The protagonist's family members are presented as disgusting and stereotypical examples of \""white trash:\"" ignorant  lazy  selfish  irresponsible  dishonest  parasitical people with West Virginan accents. Personally  I found this depiction offensive and reprehensible. There's also the depiction of a completely ineffectual priest who shows us that religion is useless and irrelevant in times of tragedy and ethical dilemmas. This appears to be an implicit justification for the \""shocking\"" ending which I found too contrived to be controversial.Apparently  mine is a minority opinion  but I've met a number of other people who share it. Here's hoping for better movies.\tFrom what I heard of Million Dollar Baby  I came into it with great expectations. After seeing it  I can honestly say that I was pretty disappointed and thought the movie was just plain average. Don't get me wrong  it's a decent story and it does turn pretty quickly  but there are problems. The first problem is that it starts off way way too slow. We literally see Maggie come back and forth to the gym with no progression of the plot. The boxing scenes are okay  but I expected more of them.MAJOR SPOILER The turn was probably the most shocking thing about the movie and kept me from falling asleep. Yes  it was a little touching  but too sentimental at the very least. Plus the death of Maggie was very grim and maybe a little unrealistic.See this film but don't come into it with great expectations."""
Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005),"Director Doug Liman  who's gotten famous for making fun movies like \Swingers\"" and \""Go\"" has successfully blended together action and comedy.In \""MR.and Mrs.Smith\"" Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt star as John and Jane Smith a mild mannered couple with dark secrets. But while on a routine mission the two discover they're both assassins working for two competing Agencies. The film them becomes a fast paced chase movie filled with high octane action scenes and rapid fire comedy one liners. But then there's the plot that kind of disappears with the explosions and fight scenes. The story seems rushed and flawed with a hint of a typical spy movie. When it comes down to it the only reason to really see this movie is to see Jolie and Pitt share the silver screen.\tThis movie is an amazing mix of excellent action sequences and unique humor. The only movie that comes close to this type of achievement is \""The Rundown\"". Pitt and Jolie work very well together and if you are a fan of either of them  then you will definitely enjoy this. If  however you don't find yourself enjoying unrealistic movies  than you probably won't enjoy this  as the movie stretches beyond what could really happen in several occasions. I also feel that the 2hr time limit is far to short as it seems like the movie moves way too fast and I would have liked to have some more story development. Anyone who enjoys a good time could definitely like this. Um  gee  how much more can I compliment this great flick?\tThe action photography was horrible! If you like watching the camera bounce all over the screen during the action sequences then you'll love this movie. When are the directors going to stop handing over the camera to their 8 year old kid's to shoot the action sequences anymore. It's like they do not want us to actually see whats going on during these scenes. It makes me dizzy to try and watch them. I don't know if it was just me  but I could not make out a lot of what Pitt was saying either. Another thing  call me old fashioned  but I like it when the guy saves the girl. I really don't think she could have held her own in a fist fight against Pitt.\tI loved this movie....for the first half of it ....then some Hollywood idiots must have thought well its to smart and sexy lets kill it with ridiculous drivel and action sequences and very predictable ending.And it worked... it sucked. But Brad And Angelina are a god and a goddess. Angelina is so beautiful her very presence can act. Amazing beauty.Yes they do have a lovely sexual chemistry together but somebody had to dumb down this film and that is the sad part about it. Why cant they leave their sticky little fingers off the creative direction of a film? You can always tell when this sort of thing happens..it goes from smart to really stupid in the blink of an eye. Order something sweet at the concession stand if you go see this at the theater. your best bet is to get it on DVD for a rainy day. To bad the film killers got a hold this one.\tMR. AND MRS. SMITH begins like a Woody Allen movie. John and Jane Smith sit looking at the camera  talking to the disembodied voice of a marriage counselor  revealing bits of their marital woes through awkward attempts at casual humor. It is a nice beginning  but totally misleading. What seems to be developing into a clever  bittersweet  sophisticated drama about a failing marriage evolves into a tiresomely violent and overwrought video game tale of suburban warfare.The twist  which the film treats as a surprise even though it is made apparent in all the advance advertising  is that John and Jane are paid assassins working for two rival  unidentified government agencies. They marry not knowing each other's little secret  which should indicate just how incompetent they are at their jobs. Then for reasons that are never made clear  they are assigned to kill each other. The result is the battle of the sexes as an extreme sport.It is an insipid idea for a movie  yet nonetheless intriguing: taking domestic violence out of the hands of amateurs and leaving it to the professionals. And as long as the cat and mouse bloodlust between John and Jane remains personal  the film has a sharp satirical edge. The battle of the sexes becomes more than a just an ironic metaphor. The problem is that the film doesn't know where to stop and a screenplay that wants to become more and more outrageous ends up just getting more and more stupid. It is alleged that the screenplay went through fifty drafts and presumably each successive screenwriter added a \""wouldn't it be cool if ...\"" moment that prompted them to exaggerate everything. When it takes on dimensions that would even be embarrassingly unbelievable in a James Bond movie  the result is like THE WAR OF THE ROSES on LSD: coyly malevolent but utterly incoherent.As the Smiths  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have a fair amount of chemistry  most apparent in a dinner sequence where paranoia and cunning are served up along with tainted roast beef and extremely sharp carving knives. But as they tango through scenes of bickering sarcasm their witty banter literally gets drowned out by explosions  gunfire and squealing automobile tires. Then  even though it rushes to resolve the conflict between the Smiths  the film drags on for another ultra-violent thirty minutes designed to -- but totally failing at -- explaining the plot's myriad loopholes. The film ends with a smug happily-ever-after in which nothing has been resolved.Ultimately  the film has no real point. As it systematically destroys all the symbols of middle-American bliss -- marriage  suburban home  mini-van  etc. -- one suspects that the original screenplay for MR. AND MRS. SMITH hoped to join the ranks of THE WAR OF THE ROSES; DIVORCE  AMERlCAN STYLE and even WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLFE? as a brittle commentary on the decline of the American family. But the right to even be compared to such films apparently was written out of the story during all those revisions  with any sharp insights gunned down by all the high-tech pyrotechnics. A film focusing on adult themes sells out totally to juvenile comic book mayhem.\tWhole movie full of faked & illogical behavior  only fighting and bombing without any necessary decoration.I can not image how could a killing company exist so obviously and equipped so modern  even can rent in a huge mansion without known by property client. Where is Mr. Smith's company  and what's the name of it? Why so many killing companies design a trap and dispatch so many personnel to kill them both  only because they are husband and wife and they might disclose too much more than they should? There is just no reasonable explanation but contradiction instead.Using mass weapon fighting and the gas exploding in the house  will that only cause a little noise to neighbors? A well equipped group arrived with machine guns and helicopters  but only a bomb made them disappeared. God help their strong house finally being destructed  and they both could survive with almost nothing hurt. I do not know why I waste too much time to write the comment especially under such badly English expression level.The movie just made me feel disappointed and bored.\tThis movie has the looks but lacks mostly everything else. It contains action  guns  high speed chases  tango dancing and whatever you would expect from the cover. Except sex. No hot scenes  nothing dirty. No fun sidekicks.The opening scene  however  shows that there could be more done with these two actors. Perhaps we'll see these two play in a movie with a manuscript that contains words instead of bullets. (Btw  the action scenes aren't really amazing in any way either - just regular high standard mediocre guns n' bazookas-action.)This is basically low quality entertainment delivered in a high quality package/format.\t\""Bourne Identity' was a great film because it tried to keep you anchored in the real world. \""Swingers\"" was great because it knew where to draw the line at 'over the top'. This movie tries to have it both ways. How can 'over the top' action scenes be taken seriously? Evidently  we are supposed to take this film's premise very lightly. But yet  there is some hardcore violence and death of a lot of good guys. How can we have any empathy for a loving couple that are being hunted  when they survive thousands of bullets with nary a scratch? M&MS does not know when to draw that line. I am reminded of moments in the series \""The Sopranos\""  which also juxtaposes violence with humor. You can only allow so much humor before you start to lose interest  and you can only take so much violence before you lose your taste for the story.The screenplay shines when it examines secrecy between married couples  and lets the characters work it out for themselves. But the third act of the film disposes a great deal of character development for standard Hollywood Action scenes. The action scenes  while technically well executed  become tedious. I was rooting for this film  because it started off as a fun and smart film. I lost it when it stretched the material and launched into cookie cutter clich\u00e9 action scenes. \""Bourne Identity\"" had action scenes that represented real peril to the lead characters  but M&MS has action scenes that make it obvious that the lead characters are more like cartoons.By the third act  my enthusiasm waned. I was surprised when I walked out to find the movie was only 2 hours long  because the way the second half of this film dragged made it feel more like 2 and \u00bd hours. I wouldn't say I felt duped  thinking the gimmick of this film would've been handled in a smarter fashion. It's just that the number implausibilities caught up with me to the point that I had to reject the entire film. Wait for the DVD.\tWho needs a plot with witty dialogue  great chemistry and non stop action. I never really cared who they worked for or why. Jolie and Pitt had sparks flying off the screen and handled the very clever and witty dialogue with style and verve. The movie made me laugh and that is not easy to do. The action was fun and that was the key to the movie. It was fun. It was a spoof. I want to see it again because it moved so quickly that I missed some of the dialogue. Unlike other pairings  Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson come to mind. Jolie and Pitt spark like Hepburn and Grant in the Philidephia Story. Or Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca. It's hard to get that kind of chemistry. Rarely do we see a film where the female lead is equally matched with the male and both are exceedingly attractive. Very enjoyable film.\tI totally loved this movie. Brad and Angelina have great screen chemistry. I'll definitely go see it again. A+ from me. The action sequences were fantastic  and the comedy in the movie was just as great. I loved the love hate relationship between the two. Vince does a great job as well  and even though his role wasn't as vital as Brad and Angelina's he was a memorable character. It was also nice to see Adam Brody in the film. What a doll. It being a PG-13 flick  I wouldn't recommend making it a family day at the theater to see this one. But teenagers and adults will love it. It's comical  adventure  action  and a bit of romance all wrapped into one. My kinda film. Not to mention the all star cast. Two thumbs up from me. It definitely will appeal to both genders.\tThere's just something too cool about spending two hours or so just looking at Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Talk about a Barbie and Ken couple!!! Whoever had the idea of putting the two of them together in what constitutes a loose and naughty remake of 1989's Kathleen Turner/Michael Douglass outing in \""War of the Roses\"" must be basking in the glow of a brilliant idea. The classic \""husband and wife bantering repartee'\"" movie is in the house once again. Directed by Doug Limon  \""The Bourne Supremacy\"" (2004) and \""Swingers\"" (1996)  \""Mr. and Mrs. Smith\"" is a delightful albeit darkly ironic allegory of the modern marriage.Beginning and ending in the therapist's office  this film comes full circle in its panoramic treatment of married life in the twentieth century. In the beginning  the couple is obviously going through relatively normal relationship growing pains. Having been married for six years  they seem to be experiencing what most married couples experience (remember \""The Seven Year Itch?). It quickly becomes apparent that their problems are far from normal and their \""growing pains\"" far from traditional. Like most couples  each of these two individuals is keeping some secrets from the other one. Unlike most couples  their respective secrets are far more serious than the average \""cookie jar theft\""  or \""lust in my heart\"" type of omissions. They are both secretly hired assassins. Yes killers  snipers  hit-men/women!! They met during a hit  fell in love  and simply avoided showing one another their true colors by slipping into a boring off to work in the morning/home for dinner in the evening routine. Now after six years of marriage  they are bored with each other because they obviously can share so little of their \""real\"" life with their mate. All this makes for a great dilemma. Don't misunderstand  this movie is far from perfect  but what it is is entertaining and really pretty to look at.Now  back to the stars. Both of these \""mega stars\"" had great notices in small parts at the start of their careers. Pitt's memorable turn in \""Thelma and Louise\"" and Jolie's performance in \""Hackers\"" are the kind of unforgettable little parts that one doesn't easily forget and that set one up for success. Both have gone on to become big stars with bigger expectations. Both actors are \""supposed\"" to make their movies make money. Unfortunately they have both had their share of questionable vehicles  but that goes with the territory. Both are well established and incontrovertibly talented actors. It truly gives one pause to wonder just how well the chemistry so fondly bandied about Hollywood circles will gel between these two strong personalities. Well\u0085.suffice it to say  the fireworks abound. Throughout this movie  these two click on all cylinders. In the indomitable style of Tracy and Hepburn  Pitt and Jolie intellectually and physically spar from beginning to end making for a raucous and undeniably satisfying jaunt through the intricacies of their erstwhile complicated lives. The plot is relatively simple - with a twist. Their chosen occupations are exposed to one another when they are sent on the same job. Because of the interference of the other \""half\""  they are equally unsuccessful in their assassination attempt and are therefore tasked with the unpleasant job of \""taking care of\"" the renegade intruder in their respective operations. Of course  it is soon revealed that their nemeses are indeed themselves. In order to not give away a couple of cute little twists  no more will be revealed here. The important thing is that the movie is two hours of grand fun. Never taking itself too seriously  this vehicle is a kaleidoscope of enchanting little surprises. Smooth and non-interfering direction combined with seamless and skilled acting make for an enjoyable and entertaining respite from the hustle and bustle of life. To be able to immerse oneself in the altogether more complicated existence of these two characters makes the moviegoer wont for more. The success or failure of this type of movie rests on the ability of the film to leave the viewer breathless. In that respect they succeed. Rampant with lots of action  chases  and cool stunts  \""Smith\"" is engaging entertaining.Bottom line  the chemistry is there  the action is there  and fine direction is there. As in his previous outings  Limon is able to carry the characters through the action sequences without sacrificing depth of character in any way. This is as much as testament to the acting ability of his stars as to his directorial prowess  but the amalgamation of the two makes for a very likable film. If you haven't seen it yet  go see it.\tI loved the action and all of the gadgets. I do like Angelina Jolie because she always plays a strong woman and that was why my boyfriend and I paid to see the movie this past Sunday  7/17. However  for the first time in my entire 36 years of living and breathing on this planet  I almost fell asleep during the last 20 minutes or so of this movie and my boyfriend DID fall asleep. The only saving grace is that we saw it at the matin\u00e9e price of $5.50 each but even that was far too much to pay to see this movie. I don't care one whit about Brad Pitt but I do like Angelina Jolie and I think that both actors did the best they could with what they had to deal with but this movie is just tiresome. Good premise but it falters at the end  BIG TIME!!!! I'm shocked that the director  producers  writer  etc.....the bigwigs.....didn't see the slowdown during the last 20 minutes or so. Don't want to spoil anything so I'll say this. Believe me  I'm not one to fall asleep easily. I have to have complete silence and darkness but yet  I damned near fell asleep during that part of the movie!! I forced myself to stay awake because my boyfriend was already asleep and he snores. There were about 30 people in the theater and I forced myself to stay awake so that I could shake my boyfriend in case he snored too loudly. I didn't want his snoring to disturb others.Bad movie. Loved the gadgets  cars  Angelina Jolie but dang! I've never had to fight so hard to stay awake in a movie theater. Color me shocked!!!!\tHumour can come from opposites  so why not take a boring suburbanite couple that lead exciting double lives as super secret agents. Thus the plot of \""Mr and Mrs Smith\"" was born. The fact that the main characters are named John and Jane Smith gives away that very little extra thought has been put into this idea.For example  every single joke is based on the housewife/secretagent paradox. Just check the \""memorable quotes\"" here on IMDb and you'll get a rough idea of the quality of comedy in this movie. It's just lame and not funny. Especially the part where Mr and Mrs argue over a wedding ring during a high speed car chasing scene. The movie \""Team America\"" has a scene that ridicules *exactly* this kind of thing. As for the action  it's big and bombastic but with barely any plot to back it up it's just meaningless and unbelievable.It's incredible to see some of the user comments that rave and cheer about this movie  and a 6.6 rating (at the time of writing) is really way too high for this b-movie with a-actors. Go see \""True Lies\"" or \""The Long Kiss Goodnight\"" instead  more or less the same plot but overall much better movies.\tI have seen the movie this afternoon. Well  the story is completely flat. Ms. Jolie looks great although her siliconed lips..... There was missing a sentence like \""this movie is sponsored by at least Tissot  Panasonic and Johnny Walker\"". Scenes like the cool shooting at the end have already been shown in The Matrix as well as the stunt drives on the highway. At least the police could show up sometimes to make it look realistic. It was not even at the level of Mission Impossible  from where the initial scene where Angelina climbs up the mountain was taken. Well  Tom Cruise did it before and the music was better. And of course Angelina sleeps with big ear rings and wakes up after a night of sex with a perfect make-up and perfect hairs. And how pathetic the whole marriage morale..... I found it also completely useless to tell that they had sex 10 times during the last week. Did this change anything or add something to the film? It was not even 2 hours of complete switching off watching a movie like James Bond  where you know that Mr. Bond always jumps out of a submarine at 200 meters depht and steps on a boat perfectly dry in his smoking with a bottle of champagne. It was a movie that pretended to be but wasn't. Probably people go watching it cause of Ms. Jolie and Mr. Pitt. Well they could have done something more in line with their careers  especially Mr.Pitt who did some really appreciable works.\tI totally forgot to review this movie. I saw this movie opening weekend and I totally let it slip and one of my avid readers (thanks Justin) reminded me that I haven't reviewed it! So on with the review...Mr. and Mrs. Smith was an incredible movie. From the very opening credits you are drawn into the world of this movie.Two secret agents who are married to each other  but don't realize that their spouse is a secret agent was just a genius script. The thing is their marriage lacks passion because the other one is just trying to play the role of a normal spouse.But that all blows up in their face when they are out on the same case one day.The banter between Brad and Angeglina was just perfect. You could totally believe that they were the characters they were playing. This movie was well directed and the action sequences are incredible.I love the number of close up shots in the middle of the action sequences that let you know that Brad and Angelina did a lot of their stunts.This movie was much better than I anticipated and I recommend it for all to see. This movie ooses with passion and you are in it with them until the very last second of the movie. I hope they make a sequel.\tTheir low is one big fake. They got marriage because of love  but everything else is a fake. They are both special agents working for a different agency. They lay themselves as long as they do not meet in the same mission on the opposite sites. In my opinion the movie has very good start but poor end. Actually I didn't quite understand the end. The films ends when they are still running away from the authorities. Soo we don't know what happened at the end. Mybe what Producer wanted to say is that all their love and life is based on running and fighting. The film itself ends pretty fast  with James Bond's style.\tMr. & Mrs. Smith.When I sat ready to watch this  my first thought was to continue with an open mind. As it is  when watching an action adventure film  you must slide into that state of mind. Taking a film like this seriously would only result in a travesty. In my opinion if the makers  writers and producers intended to make a family feature which you could sit through with a smile they succeeded.First of all i did enjoy the cast. Each character was believable as who they were meant to be. I know that sounds strange placing Pitt and Jolie as agents; but it worked for entertainment purposes. Their was chemistry between them  and it seemed they enjoyed being on screen together. And that always helps between two leading stars.Some scenes may have pushed it a little far. For example when they are fighting  it spirals a little out of control but still maintains the fun element with going too far. The action scenes are nice and balanced  and in the end it becomes what it was meant to be; An action film  which offers excitement  thrills  and a rich plot to keep an audience entertained for a little under two hours.All in all  a fun film that kept me occupied.78/100\tFrom the first moment on  I had the feeling that this film must have been rewritten by so many people so many times that the original idea -- which was excellent -- got buried under layer after layer of attempted improvement. Example - Scene One - Day - I'm sorry but if you meet your husband/wife the way they did  you won't need more than two braincells to figure out that something's up with them too -- Result -- entire premise destroyed. I'm surprised that test audiences didn't catch this. The acting was equally as weak. If Brad Pitt can't dance he shouldn't do a dance scene (note to the filmmakers  the solution to getting a hot dance scene is not by switching off the lights (!?) but by hiring an actor that can dance).. And Angelina Jolie is getting a bit boring playing the same character over an over again... That's as far as I can comment  I walked out half-way through to reproduce the braincells I lost to this movie...\tThis movie was entertainment  light summer entertainment. There wasn't much of a story but the action sequences told stories of their own  2 skilled  highly paid assassins working for rival organisations  accidentally cross while vying for the same target.Unfortunately they happen to be husband and wife the Smiths who are in a sterile farcical marriage. They discover that they both lied to each other over a period of their six-year marriage and decide to end it  but while trying to take each other out (which they do brutally)  they discover that their bosses want them dead or single i.e. \""one must die\"" They both combine forces to take on the bosses and their minions and it's one explosive fest of bullets  wits  anger and mind-blowing explosions.Pitt & Jolie pull enough chemistry on-screen to generate heat in this scorcher. The action keeps you on the edge of your seat or tuned in totally.Good Summer Blockbuster\tI really liked this movie. Their chemistry reminds you of old Hollywood couples who did a certain amount of movies together: Hepburn and Tracy  Bacall and Bogart...they were sexy together. It looks like they had fun as well  and that's an important element to any film. To look like you enjoyed doing it  because it breaks down the 4th wall for the audience. Granted  there were a lot of rumors swirling around these two  they managed to keep professional and make a kick-a$$ movie.The premise immediately took me  and when you found out who was in it  you were excited. That's how movies should operate. I could not see Nicole playing this part. She's just not sexy enough and you wouldn't buy that she and Brad were married. I can see how Will Smith could play John  but he'd really need an actress to bring on that crazy energy and chemistry the roles require. The chemistry was important  because you had to buy that despite how much they want to follow orders  part of their attraction was real  as was their love. Jolie and Pitt played that well.Ange could've been more strong and forceful in her role. I thought she played Jane waaaay too subdued. I understand she was playing the part of a controlled suburban housewife  but let's face it  they're more nagging and annoying than that! :) (Smile please!) I get that Jane was the cautious and controlled character  but she could have put more behind her. Really pumped her up and fleshed out her character so that she was believable as an assassin who's killed 312 people. I guess the whole point was that you shouldn't believe it  but we as the audience already knew  so just go with it. She could've let herself go more with the role other than just the sex scene. Pitt was charming as John  but his comedic delivery was a little off at certain points. He needs more practice. It's like he expects you to think he's funny because he's saying it. It's not enough. It wasn't a major emphasis of the film to be funny I think  but it warranted doing it properly. For the most part  he was amusing because he didn't seem to get that he was being amusing.I did notice some of the technical mistakes  but it goes with the territory. Fire the script editor or something. We don't care that much. *SPOILER* When they were in the elevator waiting to shoot off the enemy in the Home Made store and the Muzak was playing  it was hilarious. Them just bopping their heads as they're about to blow some tails. Utterly amusing. Supporting actors were wonderful. Who doesn't love Vince Vaugh? Typecasting could be a wonderful thing with Vince in the driver's seat. Had some great deliveries. The action was great  the acting  the humor  and the romantic moments (if you could deign to call them that  lol). I really liked this film. Worthy of becoming apart of my collection :)."""
Must Love Dogs (2005),"I really enjoyed the sneak preview of Must Love Dogs. Although I was definitely a member of the male minority at the preview  this film is not for women only. The film has dogs  drinking with friends  a guy on a date with three women at the same time at the same table. Diane Lane is very convincing in her role as a beautiful divorced woman who is not sure what her next step in life should be. John Cusack's role seems to be one that he has played many times; that of the man in love with the perfect woman who has bad luck.(Serendipity  Hot Pursuit) His character is not as developed as Lane's is. The film lets you get to know Lane's character but Cusack's character leaves a few questions like how does he pay his bills? The supporting cast is wonderful with too many memorable funny scenes to mention them all. There is also an exposure to poetry that is quite refreshing in this era of catchy slang movie dialogue.\tThe plot and dialogue are so forced that is was stressful to watch. Most important  the complete and utter lack of chemistry between Lane and mis-cast Cusack makes the viewer hope that they don't get together -- for everyone's sake! This is just another movie about a fretting  40-ish DWF desperately seeking romance while moping around the house in her pj's. I lost count of how many times someone told Lane  \you're so beautiful\"" and \""you deserve so much more.\"" Give me a break! John Cusak is capable of so much more than this neurotic character had to offer. Also  if I had such a meddling family  I'd put myself up for adoption! Rather than being \""cute \"" the family force was simply annoying. If you liked \""The Truth About Cats and Dogs \"" this movie will be a great disappointment.\tDiane Lane (lead character \""Sarah\"") is wonderful  as always - a breath of fresh  and authentic  air in this quite predictable  but still lovely  romantic comedy. One of \""Sarah's\"" love interests  \""Jake \"" is played by John Cusack  who seems a little less present in his role  but is adorable enough to overcome whatever is lacking in his performance; I hoped for a little more \""Lloyd Dobler\"" laser focus romantically speaking  but did find hints of it in his yearning looks and obsession with the movie \""Dr. Zhivago.\"" Among the other story lines played out by an impressive supporting cast  Stockard Channing's is my favorite; the vulnerability she displays as she searches for love in middle age is quite touching. Christopher Plummer was fine in his role as Sarah's widowed father pursued by a plethora of single golden girls. Dermot Mulroney is fun to watch  though I think that too much is revealed too soon about his character (\""Bob/Bobby\"") to keep the mystery alive in his relationship with \""Sarah.\"" Elizabeth Perkins' character is my least favorite - more quirks  complexities  or a clearer back story would make her character more compelling. Overall  I found this movie to be a delightful way to spend a Saturday afternoon.\tI must love this movie to give it a 10. And I did! It was one of the best films I have seen this year! Maybe number one! Diane Lane I have to say first is my favorite actress because she is so smart in her roles a divorc\u00e9e. In Under the Tuscan Sun she was fantastic and in this romantic comedy  she is too.John Cusack too has one of his best movies being witty. He really lightened up the scenes. He just made me smile with his scenes with Diane. Diane and John had good chemistry. It was fun.I certainly hope this gets good reviews but I have a little feeling saying the critics will think it is like every other romantic comedy out there but that is their opinion. Critics make these reviews that we shouldn't see certain movies but people have different tastes. This movie is certainly not one to be missed. I would  if I had the chance  nominate this movie at the Awards. It is a funny and heart warming story. It made me smile! A+\tWent to see the film on a sneak preview. The theater was small  but FULL. There were lots of laughs and people were happy. What a sweet movie. Even my husband enjoyed it! Go see this movie for what it is... a good  entertaining film that you do not have think about and that makes you feel good when you leave. Diane Lane and John Cusack are awesome and have great chemistry. They are both easy on the eyes. I loved Christopher Plummer (he is so \""smooth\"") and I liked that Stockard Channing was willing to look old (she really looks great otherwise). Tell you friends -- this is a great movie for a girls night out or for a date!\tYou just know that I couldn't wait until the opening next week - so  about a half dozens friends & I went to the Sneak Preview Sat. night. EVERYONE loved the movie. The lines were hilarious. My friends all want to read the book now. They were impressed with the writing and especially all the funny banter. We just had a great time and to quote a line from the movie....WAHOOOO!Far be it that we would go to an opening without a little excitement. About half way thru the movie (actually at the Thanksgiving dinner table) - the ceiling fell out - no  really. We were at a multiplex cinema in Ridgefield Park  NJ. Luckily we were sitting towards the rear - cause the MOVIE WAS PACKED (bought our tickets in advance on fandango)....anyway ...all of a sudden - the ceiling (tiles) were pouring down on us. To tell you the truth - we all thought we were under attack - Ridgefield Park is directly across the Hudson River from NYC. We were relieved to find out that it was just! structural damage. No one was hurt and NO ONE LEFT the theater. Too engrossed with the movie  so  after the initial excitement  the movie resumed AND we were all given free passes to the theater.....You can bet we will be at the opening as well. It was an evening full of theatrical firsts. Anyway  it was great entertainment ~ our crowd all left on an upbeat note...it's a feel good movie.... CONGRATULATIONS ..definitely going to be a hit.\tWe have loved Diane Lane as an actress for many many years and now as she gets older and matures  she is simply one of our finest actressess in all of Hollywood. In this movie she is also sexy  gorgeous  talented  funny and everything else you can possibly say. The movie is the perfect summer  date movie. A romantic comedy that is for everyone. No sex  no language just a wonderful enjoyable movie that you must see. John Cusak is also his usual fantastic actor in this genre of movie. He is equal to the task as he is funny  sad and simply a wonderful and talented actor who fits into any situation. The supporting cast is great. Stockard Channing  Elizabeth Perkins  Christopher Plummer all play major fun roles in the movie. Durmet Mulrooney is also great  don't miss it/\tI just returned from a sneak preview of Must Love Dogs  and I couldn't help but check my watch repeatedly throughout. I love John Cusack  but come next weekend's critics' reviews  he will no doubt be calling his agent  hoping against hope to be cast in something that will revive his career after this horrible misstep.It's not his fault -- the screenplay is absolutely atrocious. It comes across as if written by a first-year writing student. Every scene is played precisely on-the-nose  with nothing remotely approaching subtlety  character motivation  or any consideration save the single  straightforward plot. There are no subplots to speak of -- every conversation in the picture is ham-handedly directed toward its prescribed outcome.There is -- quite literally -- not a surprise in the entire film. (And PerfectMatch.com clearly paid a lot for product placement; they beat you over the head with its name.)Yes  it's supposed to be a romantic comedy  and there are allowances to be made for the genre. But the laughs are forced  the comic timing is nonexistent  and the entire piece feels like a low-budget student film.Or -- as seems more appropriate given Goldberg's pedigree -- like a television producer overextending himself in making the leap to the big screen.\tI saw the movie last night and I wasn't sure if i would like it; needless to say I enjoyed it immensely. The movie was very well written  the dialogue was very witty and funny. The cast was excellent. Diane Lane & John Cusack give outstanding performances. Stockard Channing  Elizabeth Perkins and especially Christopher Plummer were wonderful. The story moved quickly and you got to know the characters rather well. The interaction between the \""family\"" was heartfelt  very real. The dogs were adorable  kudos to the trainers. Don't miss this romantic comedy from the creator of Family Ties. You will not be disappointed!!!\tThis in an agreeable film with decent chemistry between Diane Lane and John Cusack  a good supporting cast with real roles to play  and better writing than expected.The problems are twofold. First  there is not that much screen time for Cusack and Lane together or for Cusack alone. The man is funny and has heart so why cut his part so much? Second  the ending is not up to snuff. I wish the screenwriters had worked a bit harder to tie all this together into a more satisfying ending. The last five minutes are significantly lower in quality than what went before  which leaves one disappointed by an otherwise entertaining and funny romantic comedy.\tPerfect Perfect Perfect! John Cusack has grown up but still reminds us who he is with the constant Ramones t-shirts and body length pea coat. Diane Lane who has always been one of my favorites ever since Lady Beware just shines with the same beauty as she did in Under The Tuscan Sun. She makes being over 35 and divorce look like a nice place to be instead of the old days when you were just \""OLD\"". Together they make a movie that makes you want to be in love  again! Adding Christopher Plummer and Stockard Channing to the cast just shows that getting old does not mean you are almost dying  but that you are just starting the next stage of your life! The whole movie makes you want to kiss the person that you are with. Too bad they don't let dogs into the theater. Sometimes they are better to kiss than your date!\tA very funny and charming movie in a 2005 James Garner (John Cusack) and Doris Day (Diane Lane)type romantic comedy. Diane Lane is gorgeous as usual  and a stellar actress in any film but especially a romantic comedy  and in the part of Sara she is tough and funny but vulnerable  a terrific portrait painted beautifully by Ms Lane. John Cusack is as good as it gets as a recently divorced  unhappy man that answers a personal ad looking for a relationship that will \""Get him back in the game\"". The two stars are helped immensely by Elizabeth Perkins playing one of Diane Lane's sisters  and by Stockard Channing  wonderfully playing an \""older\"" woman friend of Sara's father (Christopher Plummer). I was surprised to see the elegant  beautiful Ms Channing (see the West Wing) made to look older and disheveled in a smaller part  but she is a consummate actress and was terrific. If you go to the movies to be entertained  see this film for it's wonderful performances  sparkling duologue  and just good fun. You will leave the theatre in a better frame of mind than when you entered!\tI went to see that at a sneak preview today in New York. My girlfriend and I both really enjoyed it. The film has a very simple storyline but there are a few surprises along the way that make it not too predictable. It was very very funny and parts and flat out hilarious in others. The film overall is very entertaining and has a real feelgood uplifting feel to it. Diane Lane was great in the lead role of Sarah and John Cusack was also very good in the quirky comedy role he does so well. Everyone seemed to like the film and we will possibly see it again with friends. 'Must Love Dogs' is very  very recommended if you want a good and entertaining time at the movies. 10/10 and a real treat.\tJust returned from seeing a sneak preview of this. I love Diane Lane so I was hoping for a little laughter. I was not disappointed. This has to be the funniest  sweetest  silliest  cutest and best movie I have seen in years. The lovely Ms Lane was marvelous as the recently divorced woman urged back into dating by her meddling -but loving and close to her as skin - sisters. John Cusack is the guy who really knows nothing and over-thinks everything. The supporting cast was superb and all believable in their parts including the dogs. I read hear that it has been done a thousand times and one would have to love dogs to like this dog. It may have been done before but not this well. The dialog was believable  the characters real and the story sweet if predictable at the end. The audience (in a full theater) laughed as one and even said awwwwwwww all together a couple of times. Perhaps I was destined to like this flick but the reaction of the audience was enough to convince me I was not the only one who found this an outstanding night out. Go early and go often  Must Love Dogs is a superb and side splitting night at the movies.\tIt's been a long time since I've been to the movies and had a genuine feel good laugh. This movie is fabulous! I loved the movie but almost got as much enjoyment listening to the audience laugh out loud as well. We took an single guy with us and he loved the movie. Lane as usual  a honest performance. The supporting cast is awesome. How great it was to see Christopher Plummer. A movie to enjoy whether you are single or not and a even better one if you think love will never happen. It almost made me regret never participate in on-line dating. This movie is a must see. Take the chick flick label off  it must never be associated. Drag your friends and loved ones. A great feel good movie of the year!\tMust Love Dogs I saw the sneak preview. If this doesn't become a sitcom after wearing out the theater circuit  I'll be amazed.The script is hysterical. The soundtrack is first rate. The characters (every one of them) click with one another on screen. I'd have to stretch to find something not to like. Maybe the hackneyed story line if I had to cite something; but who comes to a romantic comedy expecting breakthrough drama? The plot: Diane Lane (Sarah) is a recently divorced preschool teacher whose \""hounded\"" by her family to get back in the dating game. Since she's not anxious for another heartbreak  her devoted sisters post an Internet ad in her name\u0085 something along the lines of \""Voluptuous \u0096 sensuous - alluring and fun. DWF seeks special man to share star lit nights. Must love dogs\"" beneath her high school photo. The offers flood in - and the fun begins.John Cusak and Dermot Mulroney are the two ends of Sarah's romantic triangle. Cusak builds boats and Mulroney is a PhD candidate. Let the neuroses begin! Stockard Channing \u0096 Sarah's Dad's romantic interest at age 71 - is on the prowl as well in the background. After the three daughters predictably push back on Mom #2  Stockard becomes a fountain of romantic wisdom (after more husbands than she could remember) to keep the others on track.Also  keep an eye on Jordana Spiro \u0096 who plays the stereotypical ditsy-blond Cusack hangs with toward the end. She has Cameron Diaz-like screen presence which could spell \""big future ahead\"". An enjoyable character to wrap up a delightful movie.I guarantee you will like this perfect date film. 8 out of 10  for tickling the funny bone.\tGreat movie with an outstanding cast and wonderful comedic moments. Diane Lane  John Cusack  Elizabeth Perkins  Christopher Plummer and Stockard Channing what an outstanding cast of performers who just click together in this movie \""Must Love Dogs\"". Diane Lane is fantastic as Sarah Nolan. She brings wit  charm  grace and soul to her character of Sarah. John Cusack is wonderful as Jake who seems to put his foot in his mouth when he is trying to say something nice. Elizabeth Perkins is great as Sarah nosy sister and has some really great lines. Stockard Channing is awesome as Dolly and Christopher Plummer is just divine as the Dad. This is a wonderful movie for all to see.\tSaw this movie as a preview last night. I think they have a real winner. Perhaps even a major hit. Good movie  strictly a chick flick.Some excellent writing. Some very clever banter and very funny segments.Some of the plot seemed not credible and off  and the overall premise is fairly corny  although with some original touches. The kids and animals are adorable  and add good color to the movie  although Newfies generally slobber a lot. Setting seems to be in a combination of Boston  Boulder  LA  and San Diego  with blue collar folks living in modest houses with lavish interiors. Must be nice to be in grad school  living in a trailer  and driving a BMW M3 convertible.But Diane Lane is utterly winning  classy  and stunning  when she is not rather convincingly looking a little dowdy and aging.Cusak is really \""on.\"" The chemistry between Cusak and Lane is palpable. To me  but not the other three viewers with me  a point of lack of credibility was that Lane's character would have any ambivalence or uncertainty toward the Cusak character. The camera loves them both.All of the supporting acting is great  particularly Stockard Channing as the brassy girlfriend of the father. That would have been an easy part to leave two dimensional  but Channing is nuanced/deep. Elizabeth Perkins is completely credible and engaging as one of the sisters trying to get Diane Lane back into the game after a divorce. Chris Plummer is perfect as the father--handsome  loving  wise  and sad. The Lane character's entire family is sweetly supportive and believable.\tMy husband and I went to see the sneak preview last night  and we both walked out saying it was better than we expected. I didn't read the book  but based on \""Serendipity\"" and \""Under the Tuscan Sun\""  we thought it was a safe bet. We were amused that the theatre was almost FILLED with females of all ages and at certain points in the movie  the entire audience went \""awwwwwww\"" all at once. I suspect most of these women will convince their significant others to see it next weekend when it opens in broad release. It's been posted before  and I agree  this is a nice summer date movie. Don't let the title fool you...you must NOT love dogs to like this movie.\ti went to see this movie expecting something along the lines of Serendipitous  with dogs instead of snow. while i certainly was not disappointed at all with the dogs  i was definitely disappointed in the story.Diane Lane is cute but annoyingly passive as Sarah  and John Cusack is typically quirky but definitely appealing as Jake. i didn't have a hard time sympathizing with Jake as he was written  but i quickly found Sarah and her life to be a bit of an impediment to letting go and enjoying the movie. her lack of willingness to take some control over what's going on in the first half of the movie is grating  and her later efforts to take control make her seem unbalanced rather than powerful. however  Cusack is at his usual engaging level of character portrayal  which made the movie still pleasant to watch despite the fact that the ending is terribly predictable in the most obvious 'Bridget Jones' style of romantic resolution (and there are quite a few eye-rolling moments in the denouement afterward).as far as the supporting cast  it's a mixed bag. Ben Shenkman is an acting eyesore and i wish i never had to see him act again. despite the fact that i like Elizabeth Perkins' acting  her character Carol made me want to yell at the screen. happily  Stockard Channing is totally charming and charismatic as Dolly  the eccentric somewhat-sorta girlfriend of Sarah's father. i believe Channing is going to inherit Ruth Gordon's role as the perfect awesome older woman. Christopher Plummer does a good job as Sarah's father  and i totally bought his character... until the Yeats. Dermot Mulroney was underused as the \""am i good or am i bad?\"" secondary romantic interest  and Michael Spound was a truly terrific foil to the others as a gay coworker and friend of Sarah's.if you're looking for a completely mindless  drama-free romantic movie experience  this isn't a bad choice at all - just tune out when Plummer starts quoting poetry!"""
Napoleon Dynamite (2004),"I didn't like this movie because the two main characters  Napoleon and Pedro  talked slowly and they didn't have many emotions. The movie was very slow and boring  and it wasn't really funny at all. There wasn't any action  either. I didn't like any of it except the last five minutes. The things that were supposed to be funny were not really funny at all. I didn't like any of the characters. The script was weak to the point of being lame. The quality of the actual film seemed more like that of a B-movie. I also object to this movie because it seems to poke fun at people who are a little slow or mentally retarded. The relative of one of the boys made fun of his nephew  and reflected little family love or concern for the boy. This movie reflected poorly on family life and family values.\tI heard about how funny this movie was  original  brilliant  etc and all I could say it was the most boring movie I have ever seen. I couldn't believe I was only 15 minutes into this thing when it felt like 45. The \jokes\"" aren't quotable  the characters are annoying  cant convey any emotion  and if I wanted to watch vegetables  I would stand in front of my microwave. Every character mumbled  showed no expression  and there was not one likable person in the entire movie. I couldn't stand the lead character  a High School Student acted like he's a bratty 7 year old. Was he supposed to be mentally challenged as well? I know others on here wrote that they knew people like this  which is scary  I think this is the same pool of actors they get Jerry Springer guests from  and who in their right mind would want to know these people? I understand that they were living a boring life  but why should I be bored watching it.When I saw the one character buy a time machine off the internet  I was thinking they should have gone back and started this movie from the beginning  with different actors  a different script  (I am assuming there was one? I didn't see it) and dumped this whole movie altogether.Others have said this was like Monty Python and South Park. Monty Python and South Park are great  the humor is on many levels  so intelligent people can get it  as well as those whose humor is that of Napoleon Dynamite. While watching those shows people are laughing for different reasons. Here  statements are made like they are funny when they aren't  unless ANYTHING a nerd says is funny because a nerd is saying it is your style of humor.\tLet me start by saying I LOVE randomly funny  virtually plot less films Those are not the only films I like mind you  I dabble in a bit of everything. But this film....wow...where do I start? First off; I thought it looked terrible from the commercials  so I had no interest in seeing it when it was first released. But everyone kept saying how funny it was. So I thought  okay well then maybe it is worth seeing. We watched it in one of my classes in high school and after the first half hour I put my headphones on and fell asleep. So I thought  well maybe I just wasn't in the mood because I heard from more and more people how funny it was. So earlier today  a person brought it into my summer school class  and we started watching it. I laughed when the farmer shot the cow in front of the school bus  and the line \""why do you drink 1% milk? is that because you think you're too fat?\"" But other than that  I found myself grinding my teeth and watching the clock. Also I was wondering why my teacher and I were the only people not laughing  he kept looking over at me with the \""why the hell is that funny?\"" look on his face. To which I replied with a shrug. Then it hit me...my teacher and I are the only ones in the class that do not do drugs  including weed. Then I also remember 2/3rds of the people who say it's the funniest movie ever made also said they were extremely high when they watched it.From what I've observed  people would find the film 'The Hours' funny when extremely high.So if you're wondering about my topic title...I was so fed up with the film and saw that it wouldn't be over before the class ended  I just asked my teacher if I could leave  he said yes. So I came home  wrote this review and that will be the last I ever speak of it.So in summary  terrible film  no story AT ALL  anything remotely funny can be found in 100's of other films. GREAT film to watch if you're a stoner  other than that..stay away. I give this film 2 out of 10 and I give it 2 instead of one on the account that I chuckled 2 or 3 times.\tBy focusing on an archetypal nerd instead of A List or near it types  this gave a surely more realistic view of high school life than many other films. John Heder's performance as the central character is amazing (look at the way he runs). His awkwardness with others  and the awkwardness of a girl who is obviously attracted to him  ring true. There were many extremely funny moments (I particularly liked the way the bully was scared off)  and the subplot with Napoleon's even more nerdy brother was entertaining  especially his interaction with Uncle Rico  the nitwit ex-jock forever wanting to get back to 1982 (a good gag here which I won't reveal). You have to watch to beyond the credits to see a final scene - they might have warned us!\tNapoleon Dynamite is unique. Not only is it shot in a different style to other movies  but the humour is on its own. In fact  it is a perhaps a new genre of comedy. Its main strength is that it goes into avenues which have yet to be touched in the movie industry. Unlike most comedies which rely on gross schoolboy jokes  this movie has a many great delicacies which are intricately timed  and most importantly  rely on the strict observation of the viewer.Revolving around some very strange and unique characters  the film is about the rise to acceptance of a geek in Idaho. However  it is not as primitive as the subject matter suggests. It is very subtly done. So subtle in fact  that most comedy fans will not even understand what is meant to be funny. There are so many nuances. Most are to do with homing in on the eccentricities of the characters.I highly recommend it to those who want a different comedy.\tMy boyfriend commented that when he was in film class  his professor warned him that there are films out there in which the opening credits are better than the film itself. He says he has now seen one of those films -- Napoleon Dynamite. I couldn't agree more. I had to leave the room to preserve brain cells lest they atrophy while watching this waste of time. We waited and waited and waited for a plot that never even thought about manifesting  everything that was supposed to be funny wasn't  and I quickly reached a point where I wanted to slap brother Kip hard enough to knock the taste out of his mouth. Maybe you have to be absolutely stoned to enjoy this movie -- I dunno. I'm just thankful that we borrowed the DVD rather than paying to rent it! Boyfriend says he's going to have a LONG talk with his daughter about her glowing recommendations of this film.\tI'm a \""50 something\"" that loved this movie! No matter the generation in which you grew up  you either laughed at Napoleon  were friends with him or you WERE him. (I fell into the last category. Yes I even lived in a small western farming community with my Grandmother.) This movie  besides being very funny  allows us into the world of the outsiders  the out-crowd  the \""didn't make the A-list\"" set. The treatment of these lost souls was not always gentle or sensitive. If it had been  the movie wouldn't be funny. This is not one for the bleeding hearts club. If you do not have a slightly warped sense of humor you may not \""get\"" Napoleon. If you do have a slightly warped sense of humor you will have to own it.\tWell  what can you say? You watch this great comedy  and for the first few minutes  you're sitting there thinking  WHAT THE HELL???? But then you rewind it and start watching it from the start again  and soon you're practically splitting your sides with laughter!! It's the funniest comedy I've seen in years- why? Who knows!! Is it how every character's voice has a unique (well  peculiar really) sound (napoleon's deep and manly  kip's lispy) ? Or is it just that we can relate so well to these nerds  whether at high-school you were the nerd  or whether you were the popular girl who teased them and ridiculed them? My friends and I couldn't stop laughing afterwards  and we would text each other quotes from the movie  and fall on the floor in laughter! I greatly recommend this movie- you either think its the best comedy you've ever seen  or the most ridiculous piece of crap ever made. You might even watch this movie  and at the end say  \""This is pretty much the worst video ever made.\"" And your Mum might reply  \""well  you can leave.\"" So whatta you say? \""YOU GUYS ARE RETARDED!!\"" Gosh!\tThere really isn't a plot. It just follows the every day life of loser Napolean Dynamite. He's bullied by most people at school and goes around telling tall tales about hunting and his hot girlfriend in Oklahoma. He befriends the new guy  Pedro  who is pretty much a loser like him. They both talk in the this monotone  sleepy sounding voice. There's a goofy outsider girl who hangs with them. Pedro runs for class president and the highlight of the film is Napolean saving Pedro by performing a skit before the elections. The dance is a hit and totally unexpected because it's actually good.The movie also shows Napolean's brother  Kip  and Uncle Rico. Each are goofs themselves. Kip mainly stays on the computer and Uncle Rico is a salesman who still dreams of the big football game in high school. he says he was good but I think we know he sucked. He even wastes money on a \""time machine.\"" The movie was sort of funny and it was amusing. Napolean says a lot of stupid things and it looks like he either squints or closes his eyes a lot. He resembles a down syndrome child. He's just plain weird.FINAL VERDICT: It wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It was amusing and had a few laughs. So  I'd only recommend it if you are looking for something unusual and not a slap stick comedy.\tBeing a nerd is never easy  especially if you're Napoleon Dynamite. Jon Heder plays the hero in this little film in which from day in and day out he is picked on by bullies  eats tatter tots during tests  rejected by the beautiful chicks and lives with a strange family including a cousin who not only is thirty-two years old  but chats on the internet everyday trying to meet the perfect somebody. With the departure of Napoleon's grandma who is away on vacation and has an accident  his Uncle Rico is there to stay and makes his life worse and pathetic for his cousin who tries to get him into schemes. Our main hero tries to help a Mexican kid name Pedro  in which like Napoleon  his life sucks as well. He comes from Juarez  Mexico in which he tries to ask the beautiful girl name Summer (Haylie Duff) to the school dance  but is rejected; even the principal discriminates Pedro's customs.There have been many films featuring loser characters in which not only do we identify with them  but we felt for them also. Take for instance \""Welcome to the Dollhouse\"" in which Dawn Weiner was the middle child who didn't get the attention she deserved (it's common)  plus she was in middle school  the worst days for kids  not to mention her last name was Weiner for which kids made references to hot dogs and placed dog pictures in her locker; Harvey Pekar from \""American Splendor\"" is more of a guy's loser in which he placed every detail in life into his comic books  not to mention how much he felt as a worthless human being since society prefer people with an education background or good looks; now people have Napoleon Dynamite  another loser we can relate too.The end of the movie made me cheer as I realize that Napoleon does have his days where he helps Pedro defeat the candidate for student body president  not to mention that his cousin gets the girl he wants and his mean Uncle gets the crap kicked out of him. I revealed the ending  but does Napoleon ever get a girl? You have to find out for yourself.\tNapoleon is my own personal hero :-))))) He's just awesome ;-) I have to admit that the film is a little bit culture specific sometimes and therefore there were references I could not understand  yet on the whole I really enjoyed it. In fact  I have to admit that I keep watching the movie again and again  especially that super sexy dance ;-))) The cast is really smart  the music is perfect  the plot is absolutely sweet. The only thing I miss is some of the deleted scenes ;-) It's a must see...We love you  NapoleonFreakin' 10 points\tThe first time I saw this movie I thought I had wasted 2 hrs. of my life. Then I saw it again and I was cracking up. It is a stupid movie and it should be celebrated for it's lack of intelligence. It's in the Seinfield category... a movie about nothing. It does have an awesome soundtrack and a great dance scene. Watch it the third time and you'll be hooked.Th characters are hilarious. I especially enjoyed Kip and his funny lisp. His girlfriend the hip chick (who couldn't be anymore opposite to him) La-Fon-Duh  is also a hit. I really think there should be a sequel though to explain Napolean himself. Where did he come from? Where are his parents? Just give some background to the story. A movie about Napolean as a kid would be hilarious.\t\""Napoleon Dynamite\"" is  in all respects  a very funny movie. However  it lacks cinematic construction and composition. Many scenes in the film stray from the story and do not affect the outcome either way  they are simply unnecessary. Even though the movie made very little sense to me  I still found myself coming back for more  watching it several times in one week. As stated in the summary  the film is more like a short film collection. It seems the story is rolling along nicely and then spliced right in the middle of it we get a short scene that is irrelevant to the movie. It's monotonous and repetitive. But  it's hilarious at the same time. I can't really say why I think this movie is so funny  but once you see it you'll understand.\tWhat a brilliantly funny  surreal  strange trip \""Napoleon Dynamite\"" is.The central character  Jared Hess  is perfectly cast as a lovable but chronically goofy high school dork and the supporting cast is equally outstanding managing to maintain a deadpan tone throughout the entire motion picture.Unfortunately  \""Napoleon Dynamite\"" is a film that you'll either \""get\"" or you wont! There's no middle ground here. But if you give this movie a chance  you'll be rewarded with a strong point of view  a social conscious and bold statements about our culture  and in a much larger context  about this strange  wonderful  twisted journey we call life. A journey where people do and say strange things and where ambition or action might not propel to a higher level or contribute to mankind. Napoleon's amplified absurdity reinforces the idea that life on this planet is here to primarily be -- to simply exist.Why film critics have been so hard on this movie  when Hollywood keeps torturing us with mindless sequels and remakes  regurgitating old ideas and concepts with little or no improvement  is beyond me.Sure there's flaws. We've all seen bits and pieces from \""Napoleon\"" in other comedies. As well  the documentarian tone isn't entirely unique. But along with Wes Anderson's \""Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\""  Napoleon creates a new comedic strain  one that is more biting  more clever  funnier and more soul searching than an average teen comedy.So watch the film and don't worry about it's low pulse or that it doesn't follow typical Hollywood structure. Enjoy \""Napoleon Dynamite\"" for what it is and what the filmmakers intended. A smart  funny study on the weirdness of humanity and the beauty  connection and warmth that that weirdness provides.\tIt's a movie  GOSH! I don't think the filmmaker(s) set out to create a classic  and no  this movie is not a classic. But I found it to be sweet at its core. I didn't see any of the \""post modern cynicism/disdain for humanity\"" and on and on that a number of other posts complained about. Though the pacing was rather slow  neither did I feel inclined to fall asleep. I watched ND with my kids  14 and 12  and Napoleon's speech patterns definitely reminded me somewhat of theirs. We were all able to enjoy the movie  and we all chuckled almost throughout the entire thing. Perhaps the key to enjoying this movie is watching it with others. Perhaps I wouldn't have chuckled nearly as much as I did if I'd watched alone. I can't say for sure.I agree with those who state that the plot is weak or almost not there at all. The music has a sort of cheesy  cheap quality - but for this movie  it all works. Almost all of the humor is in the characters  and not so much in the situations.There is an abundance of true crap out there - mindless violence  formulaic chase scenes  laughs that appeal to potty humor. ND is a small movie with a good heart. All of the invective folks seem to be dumping on it on this message board seems way over the top. If you don't like it  then you don't like it. I could name many dozens of movies  some of which were huge commercial hits  that are much more deserving of the sort of harsh criticism ND has received from many people here.\tTypical American comedy... This movie does not bring any new comic situations or humor to the cinema. All jokes are pretty much taken from previously made movies  hence making this movie very dull and predictable. There where a couple of moment in the movie that brought a smile on my face..so I guess it was somewhat funny. If you enjoyed American comedies like American Pie  and the like  you will love this one  if not you will find it to be a waste of time and money.Rating 2/10 skip it!\tWow. I guess you either love this movie or hate it. I am 33 and was rolling throughout. Even the credits are excellent. It is weird and quirky. If you appreciate Rushmore  you will like it. To those analyzing how \""unrealistic\"" it is  LIGHTEN UP.It's pretty much my favorite.Check out some of the trivia: Features one of the longest credited cast lists in movie history; all 181 student extras' names are listed in the closing credits.The movie was edited in producer Jeremy Coon's apartment using a $6 000 Macintosh with Final Cut Pro.Behind-the-scenes at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival  Fox Searchlight engaged in a bidding war with Warner Independent Pictures over the distribution rights to this movie  until Fox Searchlight put in a last-minute bid of over $3 million  and won. They would later join forces with Paramount Pictures and MTV Films to distribute the film  a mere 17 days before its release.Jon Heder was paid $1 000 to play Napoleon Dynamite. The movie grossed over $40 000 000 in the United States.Jon Heder drew all of the \""drawings\"" in the movie except the unicorn.Shot in 22 days.Jon Heder helped to make the boondoggle key chains between scenes.Idaho has unanimously passed a bill praising Jared and Jerusha Hess for making the film  citing amongst their reasons that the Preston High School administration and staff  particularly the cafeteria staff  have enjoyed notoriety and worldwide attention. Tater tots figuring prominently in this film has promoted Idaho's most famous export.\tI actually saw this movie by accident...Well  half of the movie I saw because one of my mom's friends likes to sneak into movies.Before we got caught we saw a long part of the movie and I (surprisingly)liked it.After that I saw it on sale at BlockBuster and bought it...Since then I've watched like a million times already!Me and my friends never get tired of wearing Napoleon shirts and quoting the good parts in the movie! Napoleon Dynamite probably has the worst life ever...A grandma who likes to go ride sand dunes instead of knitting a brother who likes to chat online with \""babes\"" and a Uncle who could care less about Napoleon or how many times he gets beat up at school.Then he meets the Mexican new kid named Pedro and a shy girl named Deb who (in their first scene together)\""leaves all this crap\""on his porch.This movie basically shows all of the battles of school:Class Presidents Popular kids Geeks Outcasts Bullies and Principals who always seem to pick on the weird kids like everybody else. I loved this movie because the actors spoke with absolutely no expression at all!And I think it was meant to be that way. THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME AND YOU MUST SEE IT!!We're talking about a movie that's still a good movie without cursing sex scenes and anything else vulgar!Plus it's rated PG!AWESOME MOVIE! P.S.:I wish all you other people out there would STOP hating on Napoleon Dynamite with your MEAN and quite RUDE comments!If you don't have anything nice to say about this movie then just keep it to yourself!Your comments are pulling people away from a nice movie!Write to FOX/Paramount pictures or complain about it on the message boards just stop ruining it for the rest of us who actually LIKE this movie!!\tI eyed this movie for quite awhile before seeing it just now. Everything I saw as far as clips and such were just not funny to me. I had many friends claiming it was hilarious and quoting lines that made no sense to me. Usually  if I watch a movie with low expectations  I'm surprised and like it. That just wasn't the case here  the most the movie ever got was a few weak 'heh's.It was actually more depressing than funny. I gave it a fair chance  and it was 'blah.' Apparently  on this one  its either love it or hate it.I've seen several on here say they're tired of the Hollywood main stream  and I agree. Movies anymore seem rehashed. So  I understand the desire for original comedy -- but this wasn't it for me.\tWhen my friend told me I had to see this movie  I was somewhat surprised at their level of excitement because the trailer just left me wanting NO MORE. My God was I right! This movie showed me BO funny bits  NO one liners  NO funny anything. What it did have was some interesting cinematography THAT'S IT! I questioned my oldest daughter (who said she liked the movie) and asked her to tell me just ONE funny or amusing bit from the movie. She couldn't and quipped  \""you just don't understand\"". Well the proof was there  no scene no character  no dialog was funny. I LOVE comedies and I think Napoleon Dynamite is a blight on the landscape of comedy. MEL BROOKS (if he were dead - thank God he is still with us) would be rolling in his grave if he was forced to watch this comedy. What sense (or lack thereof) of humor do these promoters of this bland thing have? Please consider how valuable time is before ANYONE ever recommends this movie again! I consider the time I wasted watching NAPOLEON DYNAMITE as precious and completely gone never to be regained  and I am furious at my friend for suggesting I should watch it."""
Oldboy (2003),"In the age of kidnap and rendition  this movie could easily be asking a more indirect question about blind revenge and skewed perceptions. People being people will always attempt to divert blame for their past follies on to handy fallguys. It's human nature to be spineless and cowardly. And the more wealth and power you have  the more spineless and cowardly you can afford to be. I get the feeling that this movie has been getting such a panning on these boards because it makes a lot of the (predominantly male) hypersensitive homespun grinches a wee bit uncomfortable. In a world of paedophile priests and an explosive growth in reported child abuse in so called civilised countries  it's a brave film maker who is prepared to jab a red hot needle into the psychotic nerve of the beast called daddy. It's a film about base human nature with all its banal idiotic miscalculations  feeble excuses and self deceit. Which is a fair premise to work with.A film is just some actors jabbering at a camera on some sets. The meanings and motives are in the eyes of the cinema-going or DVD renting beholder. Is it disgusting? Or maybe the hordes of apoplectic critics are just disgusted at their own reactions to these particular triggers?It's a film. It's a work of fiction. Don't gun down your workmates in the morning.\tSet in Korea 15 years ago  Oh Daesu finds himself a captive in a hotel room that acts as a prison cell without knowing who his captor is or why he has been held. The movie follows Oh Daesu's emergence from his cell to find both himself and his captor of 15 years.In short  old boy is a captivating revenge movie that doubles as a great  refreshing movie-going experience. While it is a polarizing film (i.e. Fight Club  Saw  movies that ppl HATE or LOVE)  I guarantee most of you will like it. I came out of this one thinking  Man  I've never seen anything like this! While it may be heavily derivative of something else I don't know of  it feIt and looked highly original and well-imagined. There are some gory scenes  but nothing I would consider gratuitous within the context of a revenge thriller. Despite its considerable violence  it's not mindless and it's not cheap: the story is fantastic but the characters and their motivations are not unbelievable. The movie admirably attempts to enter the psyche of each of the pivotal characters  including one memorable scene with a large insect. This represents a great leap for Korean/world cinema  and the world would be a better place for brave cinema as this (not necessarily as violent  though).I felt compelled to write this after reading the worst review of a movie I've read in my life. The fact that they are remaking it (as opposed to another remake of a 70's sitcom) prove that people enjoy and appreciate this story.\tI can't explain why but there seems to be a lot of hostility surrounding this film  so many people hate it and yet it has an 8.4? It seems strange that a film many will call a disaster could be ranked so highly. The reason for its ranking is that despite the opinions of some it is actually an amazing film. Technically its perfect  the only problem is in the narrative  which is quite a disappointment to say the least. You spend the whole film trying to figure it  trying to untangle the mystery of his kidnapping and then when its finally revealed you are left feeling cheated  and robbed. To some it is just too much  it devalues the entire film and so the entire thing will be looked upon as a failure. However  others will overlook the ending  or at least come to terms with it and still respect its more brilliant side Oldboy walks the line between realism and insanity  yes it has its problems  but it also has many good points. It's the same with 'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance'  and it is in 'Lady Vengeance' that I can only hope for a combination of both these two films better points with none of the negatives. You have to remember that it is a trilogy; each film compliments the other. You may well hate it but to say it is a bad film is just ignorant  personally I love it and give it a 10 out 10.\tThis is one of those rare movies that completely drew me in  implicitly forcing me to accept all the ground rules it laid out. It was such an EXPERIENCE that to break it down into separate categories (plot  characterization  cinematography) would be a travesty.However! As this is a review and not  in principle  a mere recommendation  I'll make some effort to explain about the movie. As this is a movie from Asia--and thereby subject to all sorts of conventions you wouldn't find in a Spielberg films--there are some elements that may be a bit shocking. For one thing  there's the mature content: primarily  the shocker here is in exploring issues that would likely be taboo for any American filmmaker  and an absolute death sentence in terms of finding studio funding.Perhaps more importantly  this is a movie that encourages--if not REQUIRES--an active viewer. High-budget American films  riding on the wings of Spielberg  tend to provide rather explicit narratives--that is  they fill in any potential gaps with some type of explanation. It may simply be a differing viewpoint on how a \good film\"" is narrated  but this trend is not present in Oldboy: logical leaps are made  and it's your job to keep up with them. I personally liked the change a lot: it's refreshing for a film to require something from its viewers once in a while.Again  as with many movies  this should be judged as a cohesive whole  and from that standpoint  I can say that it's an absolutely essential choice for any strong-stomached people considering it.\tI saw Old Boy on a grey market DVD about half a year ago and fell asleep during the first twenty minutes. Since then  my friends have literally been begging me to see it to the end  so this Saturday I watched it on the big screen where I had no chance of escape.Boy was that a mistake. Old Boy is by turns idiotic  horrendous and senselessly violent. It lacks the glee of the most basic revenge film. Even Kill Squad did it better.Old Boy simply has no point to speak of. My question is: How did the director and scriptwriter screw up a revenge thriller? Old Boy is very reminiscent of Takashi Miike's far superior Ichi the Killer. The difference between Ichi and Old Boy is one of extremes. Both films revolve around extracting brutal revenge. In this film  the eponymous hero seeks vengeance for fifteen years of imprisonment in a hotel room. In Ichi  Kakihari  a Yakuza enforcer  must track down his kidnapped Boss who may or may not be dead. Both Kakihari and Old Boy use torture to achieve their ends  but in Ichi the violence is committed by such dedicated sadists that it transcends itself and becomes Dionysian. Thusly  Ichi is far more violent than Old Boy  but far more aware. In Old Boy  the violence does nothing but communicate itself as alternately grotesque and depressing. The end of this film is so unbelievable that it made me wonder why they didn't just let a seven year old rewrite it. It was that bad. If you thought the end of Ichi was head-scratching  wait until you see this one. You will feel so betrayed by Old Boy's cop-out you may never want to see another South Korean film again. I think the ridiculous praise this film received (Ebert and Tarantino included) happened because NO ONE was comfortable recommending Ichi. Additionally  Ichi was not distributed theatrically in Ontario (Where I live) and was for a period  even banned. Ichi is a more violent  more difficult film  but it's rewards are far greater than this misdirected piece of trash. How this film ended up at Cannes is beyond me. I think it was because of the reputation of Park Chan's much better \""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance\"".Most likely  nothing I'm going to write here is going to prevent the curious from seeing this film. But if you feel like your time was wasted  don't tell me I didn't warn you.\tI'd like to keep this review relatively short so here goes. Oldboy was easily the best film of 2003 and one of my favourite films of all time. The story which is a twisted tale of violent revenge is fantastic  and the final twist in the story is a deeply disturbing and shocking one which gives the viewer a fantastic confused sense of what to feel for the characters. The direction is sublime as is the score  it fits perfectly with the tone and the visual style of the movie. The acting is also great  you know its a sign of a good actor when he eats a live squid  even though his parents were quite strict Buddhists. To sum up  Oldboy has a fantastic story  great acting and amazing direction  if you haven't seen this film  why the heck not?\tWow  the reviews of this film on IMDb astound me. Now I'm not one of those hyperactive film students  a person who watches \""films\"" instead of \""movies\"" or someone who's trying to work their way in the business. I'm simply a college student who enjoys movies. That being said  I have to say  I absolutely loved this movie. The story (which I won't go into because it's pretty much everywhere else) was well written and acted. Dae-su does in fact appear to be quite the afflicted protagonist. It was refreshing to see a character that the audience was supposed to sympathize with not exactly be of the highest (or even a normal) moral character.The psychology of all the characters presented in the film seems dead on to me. Many a times during the movie I couldn't help but say \""if it weren't for my morals I would do the exact same thing.\"" Those who can't understand why certain characters do certain things need to stop observing and think \""if that had happened to me...\"" As for the ending... maybe I just don't have the negative outlook on life that some others on the board have  but I found it very surprising. Not only that  but I went with my roommate and we're both in the Navy  we've seen some crazy stuff  yet we both were sickened by how twisted it was. It was so surprising that anyone could end a movie in such a messed up fashion.Well  that's enough ranting for me; I just wanted to put my two cents in for what I felt was a fantastic movie.\tSimilar to the ideal behind \""Kill Bill: Vol. 2\""  \""Oldboy\"" is not your typical revenge drama. As a matter of fact  until one views the film in its entirety one will not know of the fact that the revenge does not belong to the protagonist but rather to the antagonist.A statement mentioned in the review before mine claims that \""Oldboy\"" does not have a 'meaning'  that its ending is not satisfactory (when comparing to \""Seven\""  \""Memento\""  and \""The Sixth Sense\""). Those two films are not \""revenge flicks\""  they are trend setters that work entirely on atmosphere and that their endings do not necessarily need to be important.\""Memento\""'s ending is flawed because you don't know whether Lenny is a faker  himself  or not and whether what Joe Pantoliano says is true. \""Seven\"" had a message brought forth by a lunatic monster and after his surrender  the ending was not 'important'  but rather a balancing act between insanity and brilliance. \""The Sixth Sense\""'s ending hits you like a punch and cheats the audience because who Bruce Willis' character REALLY is is inconsequential to the story of the boy who speaks to ghosts.Also aforementioned is a quote by Morgan Freeman; but to honest  'The world is a beautiful place and worth fighting for. I agree with the second part.' is a quote from Ernest Hemmingway.Oldboy is visceral and brutal but is also bold and insightful as to the fact that although you have had harm done unto you do not try and seek revenge by murder or vigilance. Try your best to understand WHY the terrible occurrence had happened to you and what you can NOW do to fix it.That is the ideal  the 'point' of \""Oldboy\"" and it has been exercised wonderfully.It is one of 2005's best films (in North America)  although it is copyright 2004.D.\tOldboy it's an excellent movie. You may like Italian movies  french  American or Iraqi's  but this is a great movie. Perhaps  and this is happening again and again  people feel bad saying this movie is really good cause it's all the way crazy and violent. Perhaps it's just that it don't have (maybe some people think that smooth talking means \""philosophy\"") oriental deep thinking. Simple but great story  captivating and extremely fun. Also great photography and \""masterpiece's\"" actors. One of that movies that will be in history  if that people that think good cinema has to have deep meaning is not involved in critics.\tChan-wook Park's revenge opus certainly starts with a bang as we meet the film's anti-hero Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik) holding a man over the edge of a tower block by his tie. What we see \u0096 or what we think we see \u0096 is misleading  however  and gives us an appropriate introduction to Park's remarkable yet flawed saga. The opening scene echoes a much later  pivotal  moment that holds the key to the entire mystery  and neatly encapsulates one of the themes of OLDBOY \u0096 the passing of time  its resonance  the power with which control of another person's time endows us  the manner in which what is a trivial moment in time for one person can be the irreversible beginning of life-altering tragedy for another. OLDBOY is also a study of revenge  of its nature  and of the way vengeance can destroy the person who seeks it more completely than the person on whom it is intended. Immediately after the opening scene Park takes us back fifteen years to meet a much different Oh Dae-su; an overweight drunken buffoon handcuffed to the wall of a police station because of his disruptive behaviour. Bailed out by a friend  Dae-su disappears during the course of a telephone conversation  and awakens to find himself in a prison cell decked out like a cheap hotel room. This room will be his home for a decade-and-a-half during which his only contact with the outside world is via TV. He occupies his time by keeping a journal in which he records all his previous misdeeds and the people with whom he has come into conflict  by toughening his fists against the walls of his cell  and by planning his escape thanks to an additional chopstick delivered with his meal one day. Then  just as he is about to make his escape  Dae-su is released\u0085Bursting from a suitcase as if being reborn into the world  he finds himself on the grassy roof of a tower block that overlooks the street from which he was abducted. On the rooftop is a man contemplating suicide \u0096 which is where we came in\u0085 Dae-Su's ultimate failure to escape from his prison sets a precedent that runs throughout the movie: he fails in everything he sets out to achieve  largely because he is just a puppet \u0096 the target of revenge  not its architect.Asian movies are probably the most inventive in the world at present. Unlike Hollywood's Majors  which too often find themselves shackled by their fear of the influence of outspoken pressure groups and moralistic politics  Asian filmmakers are free to explore subjects \u0096 and show scenes \u0096 from which Hollywood would shrink (which leaves one fearful for the quality of the proposed American remake of this film). This film is typical of that creative freedom. The violence is both cartoonish and sadistic  and is often depicted as of a viscerally epic nature (such as the one-take sequence in the corridor of Oh Dae-su's former prison) or coolly balletic (as in his encounter with a gang of street punks). Park's camera lingers greedily on a close up of a gangster's teeth being extracted with a claw hammer  and we are treated to a scene of Oh Dae-Su tearing the head off a live squid and chewing manfully as its tentacles shiver and curl around his mouth. And yet this violence never seems gratuitous or out of place. While  when looked upon with a studied eye  the corridor fight-scene is more than a little unbelievable  by filming it Park is staying true to the film's Manga roots. Like the stories in those comic books  the characters in OLDBOY seem to operate on the periphery of a world that bears only a passing resemblance to our own. While this makes it easier for us to accept some of the more far-fetched aspects of the plot  it also distances us emotionally from the characters. Characters are all they are  ciphers  instruments of the storyteller wielded as professionally and dispassionately as that claw hammer. As with most films that rely on visceral impact to transport the viewer  the densely plotted story disguises a wealth of plot holes that only rise to the surface of the viewer's consciousness after the deliberately ambiguous ending. Oh Dae-su's actions become increasingly erratic as the tale unfolds and he comes closer to learning the truth. Given the motives that drive his character  his intense feelings for the winsome Mi-do after just a few days don't ring true even after we are given an explanation for it but  as they are crucial to the eventual outcome  leave the impression that they have been shoehorned into the plot.Visually  the film is stunning  with superlative camera-work from Jeong-hun Jeong  and Choi min-sik gives a towering performance as the embittered anti-hero. Ji-tae Yu  in a smaller but no less important role  lacks for much of the film the tragic persona his part cries out for. For my money  his character would have worked better had he been given a darker persona haunted by the events that have driven him to pursue such an elaborate act of revenge over so many years.Despite these reservations about character and plot  the film is definitely a worthwhile addition to the growing number of imaginative and praiseworthy movies produced by Asian countries over the last decade. I've a feeling that time may dull its reputation  that the talented Chan-wook Park has not yet reached the peak of his talent and will produce work in the future that will surpass OLDBOY. Certainly  the top 100 rating it holds on this website is higher than it deserves.\tOne of my favorite movies of all time. I love 'pay back' movies. Without delving into the morals of it all  I found this movie to be of pure entertainment value. The more you watch  the more of the humor you pick up. Sure  there are some intense subject matters and scenes. But seriously  if you think back to the movie  there are jokes after jokes after jokes. Case in point. Right when he comes out of the rooftop. He tells his WHOLE story to the stranger with the dog. He delays the stranger's suicide to tell his story? I mean  that's the whole first half of the narrative  it was for this stranger on the rooftop. Then  the stranger wants to tell his story  but of course  Oh Daesu just gets up and walks away. Then he freaks out in the elevator over the ugly \""woman-being\"" (he basically has a standing premature  orgasm). Then he walks out  the \""woman-being\"" is freakin out to the security guard  and the stranger jumps off the rooftop and lands on a car right in front of her  still clinging on to his little dog. Then Oh Daesu says \""weep  and you are alone  laugh and the world laughs with you\""  or something like that......then he puts on a crazy ass smile and walks out of frame. Love it!\tI watched this movie 4 times. It was interesting to find points that I had overlooked in the previous views.Just one comment on various bells adopted in this movie  such as the chime of the hypnotist  cellular phones  door  bike  and etc. I thought about the importance of bells in our daily lives after watching the movie. Bells sometimes mark the beginning of a new scene in this movie. Oh Daesu was also conditioned to act as such after hearing the ringing sound of the cellular phone. We also begin and end some actions by sound (e.g.  after receiving a phone call  we respond  think and act -- a sequence). In this sense  we are also conditioned to bells. In ancient times  drums or horns may have been used  while we are living surrounded by electronic bells (e.g.  various alarming sounds in windows-based PC).When I grew up in Korea  I hated hearing those bells everywhere -- home  subway  school  street  hospital  and even in Buddhist temples. I guess the director may have similar feelings on bells  considering he is of my age.\tI rarely give out 10's to anything  especially when it comes to film. It's like in my business of movie posters  there's rarely a time when I call a poster \""mint\"". It's just so rare. This movie has a lot going for it  and unless you don't listen to the guy in the first post  you'll never know what you're missing. The fight scenes  especially the one take hallway scene  are incredible. For this actor to do much of his own stunt work was great. It gave the film a presence. The opening scene in the police station was improvised and brilliant. Honestly  if you're into Tarantino  revenge or crime film  then this film is for you.\tThe first third of the movie was well done especially the first 15 minutes or so - it was deranged  strange  and well told with the main character's description of his past and the way the time flashed by. You see the characters torment. Some very witty lines shine too with him wondering whether imaginary TV training can carry into the real world. However the violence often becomes too much of a spectacle and at times too glorified. While the visual content sometimes I question  the style and make-up of the cinematography is well done. Unfortunately as is often the case with movies - the ending suffers; the twist is more for shock value and very predictable - they would've done better going a traditional route with it  or at least something with a little more integrity. Also  the final suicide is absolutely pointless further detracting. How could the father make that decision also?? Anyway  worth a look if you can handle the utter lack of integrity to stoop to for entertainment's sake I guess - are you entertained by immoral  base  and twisted ideas? If so enjoy.\tI'll admit that if I am not sure about a movie  I will exhaust as many reviews as possible to \""influence\"" my viewing of that movie. This is my first comment and it is sparked by the unbelievable amount of bad reviews this movie received on this website by members. This movie was actually pretty good; good story; good acting; great cinematography. The movie definitely held my interest the entire 1 hour and 50 min. run time. THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! The movie centers around Oh Dae-su  a man imprisoned for 15 years (no scenes of torture) and then released. He meets a waitress  Mi-do and together their adventure begins. Oh Dae-su begins to track down his captors and eventually finds him. The movie is easy to follow and understand;it all gets explained rather well by voice-over and flashback so their is no confusion as to what is going on. It is discovered less than halfway who the captor is and later on he explains why he imprisoned Oh Dae-su. There was definitely some brainwashing and mind control techniques going on while Oh Dae-su is imprisoned  but it is implied. The movie is not that bloody or gory at all - most of it is implied and not shown on screen. The worst scene for me is at the beginning when Oh Dae-su goes for sushi and meets Mi-do and asks her for something \""live\"" to eat. I definitely recommend this movie as it has received an unjust amount of bad reviews. 8 out of 10!\tThis movie is brutal. If you don't like or can't take brutal violence  don't watch it - it's not for you. That being said  it's much more than that. If you go into this movie not expecting much  you'll appreciate it far more. By the way-do not watch this movie with the subtitles on- the dubbed voices are much closer to the actual translation. The climax of this movie had me wide-mouthed and all I could say was \""no f***ing way\"" over and over again in disbelief. You must see this movie. If you hate  you hate it - but I've never seen anything like it. I still get goosebumps thinking about it. The actor that played O Dae Soo (forgive the spelling)  was amazing - and so was the soft-spoken villain. The direction was beautiful. This is a classic.\tTHIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS. MASSIVE  MOVIE RUINING SPOILERS. DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE.From the most recent reviews of this movie  it seems that quite a bit of people  instead of paying attention  chose to make a knee jerk reaction to praise they felt was unwarranted  but which was in actuality completely and totally warranted. I just watched Straw Dogs  a highly acclaimed revenge movie from the 70s  and I felt Oldboy was equally comparable in quality and just as strong in story and motivations behind plot elements.For example  some have stated that Lee Woo-Jin didn't have enough motivation to want to destroy Oh Dae-Su's life. He did. Lee Woo-Jin lost his lover  his closest sibling  and what can only be assumed to be his closest-confidante  and all because of Oh Dae-Su's glib tongue. Oh Dae-Su realizes this at the end  which is why he removes his own tongue and why he supplicates himself to save Mi-do. He realizes that he was in the wrong in that instance  and his lack of discretion irreparably ruined the life of a classmate. Perhaps  due to your thoughts on incest  you believe his life was ruined justly. That is one way to see it  and one I agree with.But even though Lee Woo-Jin was morally reprehensible and a disgusting individual  he would still have emotions and feelings  feelings which led him to treat Oh Dae-Su as he did. He didn't just want to hurt Oh Dae-Su  he wanted to ruin his life and leave him helpless while he ruined it.Some have commented on the hypnosis factor of the movie as unrealistic. To that I say... so what? When you watch a movie  you suspend your disbelief. The best picture winner of last year  Million Dollar Baby  completely botched their treatment of intensive care patients and was extremely unrealistic. It was still highly lauded with praise by many movie goers. Movies many times get technical details wrong. If a movie where a man trains himself to be able to fight and then beats down about 20 people all by himself bothers you because the hypnosis factor was a bit unrealistic  then you have some extremely bizarre points of view.Oldboy was a beautifully shot  wonderfully acted  and carefully plotted movie. Plot holes? Almost none. For such a complex plot  that is quite an achievement. Was it hard to follow? A little... but then again  most people are incapable of following a movie that does not hand them the story in easily digestible bits  so that's not a problem  it is actually a plus.Maybe some didn't find it had enough action. Maybe others were disturbed by the inclusion of incest. Maybe others just wanted to be different from professional critics. Whatever the case  Oldboy was a fantastic movie. One of the finest revenge movies ever created.\tOK  perhaps there is truth in the saying \""lost in translation\"" because I absolutely do not understand why this movie has garnered the praise it has. It is a mess  an absolute mess from beginning to end. The only positive thing I can say about it is the wickedly twisted revenge plot. There is no cohesive story line  no attempt to give the viewer any kind of clue about what is going on. You are kept in the dark the whole time  which I assume is the point. But by the time the final credits roll  you want to borrow one of the hammers used in the movie and beat yourself over the head with it to stop the pain that the film inflicts on your senses from trying to make any kind of sense of it.I have since gone back and watched this film again without the dubbed soundtrack and though I still feel it is way over hyped  I do not feel it is as bad as my initial review of it above. I have given it another star from my original 4 that I gave it. Still  the movie\tThere are movies that aim to entertain  and there are movies that attempt to say something. This movie aimed to do both  and succeeded admirably. Sure  upon reflection  various parts of the plot don't seem to follow from one another  and so many things in the movie are implausible. But does one want a movie that is as smooth and plausible as yesterday afternoon? Like it or not  human life is tortured and zigzags without warning. What matters is making sense of it afterwards in a way of one's choosing.This movie is not really about revenge. It is about the human need for knowing things not just about oneself  but about other people. The protagonist could never have lived with himself without knowing why certain things happened to him. Our lives make no sense when the intentions of others are ignored.Most touching in the movie was the woman's sacrifice for the protagonist and his for her. They were entirely dedicated to each other  and showed that one being willing to do anything to make another happy alone induces happiness.Thus  the movie invites the viewer to contemplate his need not only for narrative meaning in his life  but also for the intersubjective quality of that meaning.\tI wont speak on the plot  or talk about the characters or various scenes. I just got done watching this movie about a half hour ago and I'm in complete awe. this was by far the most original movie I have ever seen. It contains so many different genre themes and yet defies them all and stands as it's own unique work. The acting is top notch I might add.Don't go into this movie expecting anything at all. Just sit  and watch  and take in the full experience. If you can appreciate an original movie  despite some unpleasant or even disturbing elements  then this movie will likely hit you like a sledgehammer.For me  this movie will easily be one of those classics in my collection that I value as more than just a movie  and will re-watch many many times for years to come."""
Open Water (2003),"Well I can't believe some of the bad reviews of this movie  firstly if you like mainstream predictable sweet Hollywood-go watch something else. I thought it was very realistic. It was good to see some unknown actors whom can act. The relationship of the characters was well portrayed-the squabbling & bargaining for sex is something I can relate too. Also the nude scene was brilliant-for starters a realistically shaped woman's body  and somebody that doesn't wear a t-shirt to bed and cover up with sheets in front of her husband. Great that you could conjure up in ones imagination  the gory detail of the shark attack. This is not really a scary movie but more of one of humanist interactions  dialog  a tad of hum our  some great scenic visuals and a small to medium dose of suspense\tThis movie is not a Hollywood ending  thank you very much. This couple needs a break from their careers and cell phones  sound familiar? Most endearing is the relationship of this couple as we look through our own eye lenses  we see ourselves. The director skillfully pushes for a real life experience and successfully drives it home; that fact scares the audience. As the movie continues to unfold  the audience is tense and on edge as if  the director has cast the audience as part of his movie. There is a strong sense of hope that stays with the audience all the way to the ending. The movie is tough on our senses of how things should be. Nevertheless  life is this way. Did the audience feel she gave up? This is what makes this movie memorable and forces us to ask that question  what would we do in the same situation? The story also reminds me of a true story that happened to someone I know  except after 17 hours of staying in the water; a ship saw her and rescued her  her partner did not make it  he had drowned many hours before the rescue.\tNothing happens. I waited through the whole movie for something to happen and nothing ever happened. They just sat there in the same location. This movie must have cost about $30 to make  for a videotape.One scene. No plot. Lousy acting. No suspense. No resolution. Just two idiots sitting there talking. Floating there  that is.Not even any scenery to look at  just water. Boring Boring Boring. Everyone booed at the end because everyone was so disappointed in this piece of garbage.You are sincerely wasting your time with this movie. Don't see it.Don't waste your time. The makers of this film should be shunned.I can't believe anyone has given this movie a higher rating than the minimum \1\"" rating. It was easily the worst  most boring  movie I have ever seen in my life. Be warned: don't waste your time with this crap.\ti could not believe how dreadfully amateur this film was. from moment one with the shaky camera  to the last 5 minutes where the script writers telepathy had obviously informed him of the events out at sea unaccountable by any human being seeing as none returned  this was turd of the highest calibre. weak and unforgiving open water was a drawn out waste of money  good for nothing film. i am shocked by IMDb voters opinions which i normally share. poorly directed and ashamedly acted. i have never been grouped with more unenthusiastic and disappointed cinema goers  expecting the world from the hype this film received and being granted nothing more in return than a 2 hour sentence reduction in their life span. we kept wanting to leave the cinema but were struck by an unusual sensation  a thought that said \""its got to get better  it cant be this bad. \"" .... it was.\tWhen i watched this movie i thought straight away after about 2minutes of it that it was very unprofessional and looked like a amateur filming  plus the acting is bad I've seen better in hollyoaks  but i didn't expect much when there was only $130 000 invested in this movie. The movie itself is similar to the Blair witch project  except this film is worse there's nothing exciting about this movie  its just like watching a home movie of a couple on vacation through most of the movie  i don't think this movie is worth buying i also cannot believe it got released in theatres and DVD. I recommend you renting before buying because in my opinion i think you will be disappointed.\tFilms which ride on talent  both acting and technical are by far the best. I am getting bored of the \""Blockbuster\"" films like Lord of the Rings  Star Wars and The Matrix. The audience can see right through them yet get dazzled by the computer generated scenes.Open Water is an example of a brilliant film with only the essential animation  relying on old fashioned film constituents. The acting is believable and the cinematography is transcendent of most other recent films. There is not a great reliance on computer animation in this film  despite this they are very realistic. Tension and anxiety are brilliantly created through suspense and the continual threats posed by the ocean. Well until the end the audience is given a glimmer of hope for the main characters. Their fate is always uncertain.I was disappointed that the film wasn't set in Australia  the location of the event from which this film is based. For those who are aware of this event which took place over the Great Barrier Reef in Australia  the outcome should be obvious but isn't. This is due to Chris Kentis and Laura Lau's brilliant version of the tragedy. They have created a thrilling and startling film which will be on scuba-divers minds for years to come! The Jaws of the new century.\tI really have to say that I completely disliked this movie. I am still unable to comprehend the fascination that this movie had with viewers. I have heard that it's the best movie since Jaws. I must disagree. While the plot was somewhat interesting  the overall content of the movie was flat. The characters were alright but not completely believable. The only reason I saw this movie was because I was on vacation and while a friend was visiting with relatives  my other two friends and I decided to see this movie  thinking that it would be somewhat decent. I don't think I can express the level of disappointment that my friends and I felt. Perhaps I need to watch it again to see if I missed something. But then again  if I didn't miss anything  another 2 hours of my life will be wasted.\tOK...this movie really  really  really  really sucked. they hyped it up to be something big...and then it just doesn't deliver. It had all the potential of a good movie. They should have spiced it up a little and added more action. It was about an hour and a half of watching water...just plain water. i fell asleep like 3 times while watching it. It was very long and very boring. No real action. The only real interesting thing about the movie was that it was based on a true story. Had i been the one in the water  i would have died from boredom. I mean really  who's idea was it to make this movie. They stay some stories are better left untold. And  trust me  this is one of those stories.this movie just really sucked...\tI was a bit hesitant about watching OPEN WATER at first. Although I enjoyed the lo-fi production qualities and sheer realism of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT  I must confess that they are not the type of movies I'm used to see. The hand held camera moves  the \""documentary\"" feel  the \""I could have done this myself\"" kinda thoughts  I went through all of that but ultimately enjoyed OPEN WATER and applaud the film makers for making an entertaining 83 minutes.Although the movie was shot on a hand-held digicam  this is NOWHERE as shaky as BLAIR WITCH  or by that means  as movies like IRREVERSIBLE that starts off as a complete unwatchable blur. Instead we see a movie that could have been shot by you or I  given some shooting background. OPEN WATER is the story of a couple who takes a trip down to the Caribbean  away from their daily grind. The two enroll in a scuba diving trip to a coral reef near the coast. During the trip  by some rather unconvincing error  they are left behind by the rest of the scuba diving team and now have to manage to survive in a sea infested with sharks  barracudas  jelly fish and other critters. The acting is very believable as you hear the actors belch forth the kind of words YOU or I would say if something like this happened to us. Just imagine the total ANGER towards the scuba diving team and towards the people they paid this trip for!!! Yet  all of theses angry feelings are replaced by feelings of fear  impotence and uncertainty. What will happen to them? Will they get eaten by sharks? Does these things happen often??? It's when you ask yourself what would you do in their position that the movie really sinks into the viewer.Granted: if you're expecting a fancy  Hollywood kind of thriller  stay away from this; you will PROBABLY not like it and the action during the first half is rather slow. But if you liked something like BLAIR WITCH  you will surely want to check this one out. The ending will leave you asking many questions and it would be interesting to have a message board about it. 7 out of 10 (for its lo-fi qualities)\tOpen Water isn't a bad film  but neither is it a good one. It is filmed in a 'Blair Witch' or 'home video' style which can get a little annoying. It follows a married couple  Susan and Daniel  on their holidays who decide to go on an scuba diving excursion. While out at sea  other members of the party return to the boat ready to go back to shore. There is a miscount and times get mixed up and so the boat returns to shore leaving Susan and Daniel stranded in the middle of the sea of which they are unaware. It does make you think about how daunting that would be and is sure to put off some viewers from going on such excursions on their holidays. I guess this is where the story ends because as you may guess a shark is sure to come and eat them- I mean there's 2 'pieces of meat' bobbing up and down in shark infested water what else could happen. What get's a little tedious is that every so often Susan or Daniel get bitten but it's not enough to leave you on the edge of your seat  especially when it happens 4 or 5 times. You horribly start hoping a shark will come and swallow them whole instead of taking small bites and keeping the film going on and on with nothing but that. A part of you also wants them to get rescued-basically something different than just floating in the middle of the sea. Unfortunately the film doesn't get anymore exciting. It's quite unclear what happens to Daniel-his body gives up I guess after being gnawed at a few times and he floats off leaving Susan. She suddenly is taken underwater in a slightly dramatic but boring ending. This film is OK. I can see how it would appeal to a certain audience-those who are not fond of the usual Hollywood blockbuster. The film can get slightly boring and could've done with a little more dialogue but not all bad.\tThis movie is more \""tense\"" then it is really scary and is not to be confused for a shark horror flick (ie Jaws or Deep Blue Sea).The movie is short  but intense once it gets going. It feels more like a documentary - there are a LOT of sharks. I felt like I was watching one of those nature shows where you see the animals starving  suffering and dying but rather than interfere with the course of nature  the suffering is captured but not prevented (the cameraman doesn't help the baby thats lost its mama but rather lets it suffer  even perish  on camera for the sake of realism)- that kinda thing.The acting is quite good and the timeline or \""flow\"" is great - things happen kinda slow at first - it seems real  they don't just get swarmed by sharks the second the boat leaves... there are other nasties too! The movie not only deals with the real physical threats in the ocean  but the mental threats as well - the horror  panic and stress that slowly takes over the two drifters.So while the movie isn't scary visually  the idea of it is terrifying! You can't help but to imagine yourself in that situation - drifting helplessly through the huge expanse of ocean with nothing to do but think (about hunger  thirst  fatigue  horror  panic  and a possible death by drowning or worse hungry sharks)... well thats just creepy! The situation gets worse and worse until... well just watch it - its only 90 minutes!!\tSTAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits In an attempt to spice their marriage up  a young couple (Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis) head off on a scuba-diving expedition to the Caribbean. However  this will prove to be the biggest mistake they ever made. The incompetent diving crew fail to include them in the head-count and they are left stranded in the middle of the ocean. It becomes a desperate struggle for survival to make it back to dry land in one piece.I'd reviewed this film already  but the IMDb failed to process my comments for some reason! Anyway  enough of that  this is my new review. Although Open Water is not a movie without it's flaws  I am quite fond of the Blair Witch style use of camera and filming style. A problem for me might have been that there wasn't enough exciting and scary stuff happening  but on the other hand I suppose this did sort of add to the tension and atmosphere of the whole experience. The gradual build-up of the tension is quite well done  especially for such a short movie. The movie also boasts some fine cinematography and some beautiful shots of the ocean  especially in it's purest blue form.Overall  the lack of eventful stuff happening is sort of a spanner in the works  but this is undeniably a well-made and cleverly conceived movie that deserves a wide audience that it's low budget feel might not aim it at. ***\twe rented this movie expecting it to be worth seeing. it had no plot. and frankly the camera work was horrible. we felt this movie could have been better shot with a fifteen years old video camera and a child of three years old running that camera. the dialog was extremely cheesy. granted it was based on a true story but other movies have been made out of true stories that had great reviews (such as radio starring cuba gooding jr or coach carter starring samuel l jackson) with much more success than this one. if your thinking of renting this movie do yourself a favor and save your money. watching open water is not worth your time or your money.\tI think this movie was the worst I have ever seen.It was almost like torture watching it. The only reason I even finished the dumb movie was to see what pathetic thing they would come up with next. The acting sucked and the people did the most stupid things that made no sense. The ending was so bad I was like \"" is that all???\"" I have never been so disappointed in a movie. There was NOTHING scary about this movie  so when you go rent it don't expect JAWS or anything!!!! I think a 10 year old could have made a just as good of a movie.I really like movies and I wouldn't even call this a movie. Oh  and the sound track did not go with the movie at all. Someone would have to pay me to watch this movie again!\tI had read a brief synopsis of this film few days prior to viewing it  and I thought to myself how could one build a full-length film out of this? Later when I saw the film  it was above my expectation  and I was completely satisfied with its scripting  plot-lines  and casting. The lead characters were well chosen as they looked believable. The film had a perfect flow of narrative which built the audience's curiosity towards thrills and chills in the film.Half way through the film it makes you think \""how responsible did the travel agents  boat-men  and the hotel owners felt\"". Such a mistake is unthinkable  i.e. leaving the couples stranded in the middle of the ocean.I applaud the film director's imagination which was well portrayed visually. If he continues to think in this fashion then I am sure he will be the next Spielberg.Anyway  grab the DVD and watch it at home with a few mates  and I am sure you will have a lot to talk about after the movie is over.NOTE: Don't let this put you off \""water\"".NEIL BHATIA\tThe film was described as 'Jaws meets Blair Witch'. The only similarities I can find are that it appears very low budget and there is a shark in it. The tag line should have been 'Two bad actors. Lots of water. No storyline'. Don't get me wrong  I am all for films that make you think  make you wonder and try to put the audience in the situation- Phonebooth was an excellent example- but this film does not have enough going on to keep you interested  there simply isn't enough to think about and the acting is so diabolical I actually ended up wanting them to be eaten by sharks just to put me out of my misery.If you have read this far and are still planning on watching this DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER (unless you want to know the ending in advance)This film I understand is BASED on a true story- but how? They both died! How can anyone possibly know for sure what happened after they got left behind? How do we know they didn't end up going crazy from all the sea water they swallowed and ended up drowning each other? OK  I admit that is a bit extreme but there is no way anyone could know what really happened out there!\tMy brother rented this thinking he would get Jaws. Boy was he wrong. I was unfortunate enough to have saw it too. From the beginning when you watch a guy dial his cell phone for 30 seconds until the end when you watch people endlessly float through the water and puke on each other's heads. There were occasionally exiting parts like with the sharks and jellyfish. Although  I think this movie did to me what it was supposed to do. I have not gone scuba diving ever since I saw it. It also blew my mind when I heard that no effects whatsoever were used in this movie. The bottom line is if you think you can rough out the hour and a half give it a shot. I mean it isn't the worst movie in the world.\tI was reading through comments from reviewers here  and came across this one (who incidentally gave it a low review): \""I have just finished watching 'Open Water' and must admit that I have been left feeling rather confounded as to how I am meant to feel about the content of this film.\"" That  my friends  is unfortunately the mentality of the average Hollywood film-goer. So used to being spoon-fed  that a movie like this will probably seem like total crap. After all  it doesn't tell you how you're supposed to feel and what you're supposed to think!I found the film to be very suspenseful and a great existential meditation. I may have been lucky in totally avoiding the hype... I was never even aware of this film until my brother rented it on DVD  and was able to view it with no preconceptions at all. I found it very spooky and well made (far better than \""Blair Witch Project\""). Some of the lines were a bit cheesy  but not too terrible (like the characters repeating \""Nobody we know has ever {insert phrase here}\""). These few cheesy lines can be forgiven in the scheme of things  particularly with such a low budget involved.Overall I give this a 7/10... a good watch for the thoughtful  patient moviegoer (yes  an attention span is actually required in this one -- will wonders never cease?).\tEvery comment on the nude scene simply says it is gratuitous. Just because so many movies do have gratuitous nude scenes is no reason to gratuitously label all nude scenes as gratuitous. In this case  it is necessary. You are at the point where you are wondering whether you should be caring about whether this couple should live or die  and whether they are just harried yuppies or fragile  sensitive  and  yes  beautiful human beings. This scene pulls you over that edge. From that point forward you can really identify with and care about the characters because you have seen them at a vulnerable but plausible moment  where their guard was down. Does everyone sleep and read naked? Maybe not  but they should (I do)! The rest of the moment really builds well off the initial scenes. It helps  as in my case  not to know the outcome. The only implausible part  which I have to say was forgivable  is that in reality within 2-3 minutes of discovering they were stranded they would have panicked like crazy and realized they were almost certainly going to die. But having well established what kind of people they were it seemed plausible. One more point: the mere fact that so many people comment on this movie proves its worth.\tA couple goes on a vacation. They go on a scuba diving boat trip. The boat forgot them and they probably died of starvation/thirst. Thats the part of the story thats based on true events**SPOILERZ**A couple goes on a vacation. They sleep naked together. They go on a boat trip. The boat forgets them. Jelly fish attack them. They wade in the water and do nothing. oo yes and sharks attack them. And the chick kills herself at the end and watches her husband get eaten. Thats The Hollywood part of the storyI wouldn't watch this again because most of the movie is them wading in the water and arguing. with TERRIBLE ACTING!"""
Over There (2005),"Over There has a shot at being a good show. Really. But at the time it's lacking and badly at that.It's unfortunate. They have badly clich\u00e9d characters  and rather unbelievable situations. The soldiers we have in our Army are trained a lot more than what they portray them. The military adviser to the show probably doesn't know as much as he should.I also wish the show would stay away from the politics. A little to cause tension between the characters wouldn't really bother me  but ew  the guy questioning what happened at a roadblock bothered me. In the military  you really don't ask such questions. They don't need to shove the fact that war sometimes kills innocent people  but they were given clear warning to stop  and other than Mai Li 4  we really haven't had many incidents of soldiers killing for fun.On the plus side  the show is tense  your really not sure what could happen at any moment. The story line may be linear  but the action is unpredictable. A main character could be offed from the show at any time  and that may cause some really good television. Hard to watch at times because of it's potential to disturb you even.The same goes for the scene with the guy's lady back home banging another guy within a week of his leaving. It's sad but it happens. A buddy of mine left for Iraq and within a month  I saw his fianc\u00e9 screwing around with some dude at the mall. A sad story  but it happens.Overall  this show could become more  and may  but it's off to a so-so start and needs to pick it up a little before it gets lost.\tWhen a series wants to present itself as hard-bitten and realistic  it needs to pass a certain test. I loved 'NYPD Blue' and the original 'Law & Order' for their gritty realism. It wasn't the costumes nor the camera angles that made them gritty. It was the stories. The characters were human  acting on limited information  trying to muddle through to a good result. *MOST* of the time  they found themselves vindicated. But it was the *OTHER* times that made those shows truly great. The times when their best intentions lead to disaster; or the heroes lose control and do evil; or they cover up a crime due to loyalty. Dramatic tension arises when you don't know which type of story you are watching; when uncertainty dogs the characters through every scene. So far  'Over There' has only been the first type of story - the heroes are *ALWAYS* vindicated. If it stays like that  then the series becomes little more than a morality tale. I am hoping for something more.\tSteven Bochco's \Over There\"" is to Operation Iraqi Freedom what \""Lost In Space\"" was to the Apollo program. As an OIF vet  and an officer with 24 years experience in uniform I watched the pilot episode on FX and was appalled. I watched the whole thing and gave it a chance  but It was garbage  totally unbelievable with implausible situations  characters  and dialog. Who is the military consultant on this show? Michael Moore?Bochco and co-producer  writer Chris Gerolmo have made US Soldiers look stupid  unprofessional and completely inept. Portraying them as regulation-breaking  pot-smoking  back-talking  and risk taking was insulting to the hard-working pros that make up the vast majority of military members  especially those serving in Iraq. This production is not helping our soldiers at all; it makes them look bad at a time when we can ill afford to damage their credibility with the public. Their use of worn-out stereotypes of screaming sergeants  racism against black soldiers  sexism against female soldiers  and contempt of officers is outrageous and could not be further from the truth. They have simply taken characters out of old war movies and recast them in desert camouflage.We don't throw rookies into the fight without any training. Troops in Iraq have been together for a long time in the US training for many months before going overseas. When they arrive in theater  they train some more. When they reach their base  they train some more. Our soldiers know each very well way before they find themselves in a firefight. The idea that new recruits would be dropped into a fire fight is Viet Nam era thinking. It just isn't done today. Our professional non commissioned officers (sergeants) do not swear at officers  or scream at their soldiers. They do not threaten them...\""I'll shoot you myself.\"" And they would never make one sergeant stay behind to train \""virgins\"".It is clear they had no current or former members of the Army participating. Their reference sources are \""Platoon\"" and \""Apocalypse Now\""  plus the headlines from newspapers. They are not at all interested in what is really happening in Iraq  how Army units operate  what tremendous progress is being made  or how many lives have been changed for good now that the freedom loving people of Iraq are free from Saddam Hussein and his dictatorship.\tI am an Soldier who was in OIF 1; I am getting ready to go back soon. My question... are you all entertained? Maybe when I get my spinal column split by shrapnel  or worse  maybe one of my buddies does  the producers of this show can use that in the script. To the critics of this show  both liberal AND conservative  we do not fight for you... we fight to keep each other alive and make it back home. Plain and simple. This'll probably go over your heads  but that's okay. If you want to see the situation in Iraq  see Gunner Palace. Over There attempts to put my buddies and I in the spotlight. I have news for you... we don't want it. We are just ordinary Americans who are put in an extraordinary situation  and we are trying to make the best of it. The first Iraqi I came across was a little girl. I gave her a roll of hard candy from my MRE (Meal-Rejected To-Eat). The smile on her face was priceless. Are they going to put that in the show? Are you entertained? Are you not entertained?\tAs a Military Instructor who'd have served in the Army for 15 years  my 'cruits  on the eve of there graduation was fortunate enough to see the show \""Over-There\"" before they are on their well deserved leave before shipped to parts unknown.I have served 4 deployments including Operation-Desert Storm and Iraq Freedom so my 'cruits and I was anticipating for this show. Prior to the show  I gathered a pool of money with my instructors and got some poogie bait (snacks and soda). I was fortunate enough to spend their last day on Change of Quarters (CQ)so the day room was left for my disposal.Before the show started  I briefed soldiers that they should remind themselves that this is only TV show and shouldn't be construed as a documentation.The Show began and the very first part shows the different types of departure the soldiers faces. I was shaking my head when one of the soldier started to have sex on either newlywed wife or fianc\u00e9'on the day before leaving. Not what I call tactful. It probably send half of the soldiers of my unit the idea. It kinda broke the ice toward the soldiers but  for me  it came out wrong.Then came the Brother with the Weed...totally \""NO-GO\"". If he had that drug problem  he'd been gone out of the Army faster than a flaming jack-rabbit stewing on a witches brew. What's even disgraceful was he wore the patch of the 3rd Infantry Division (DOG FACE SOLDIERS). Even if my 'cruits didn't know what unit he'd belong to  the GOSH DARN sign bearing \""3rd Infantry Vehicle Motor Pool\"" was a dead give away. I've stood along side with my 3rd ID brothers in both wars and they truly deserve a lot more respect then to see this display of activity.The three other people were so much stereotypical that it's pointless to write about it.Before I continue  I would like to say that during this point of the show  the 'cruits started to get ideas that graduating out of their units will place them in these few categories. Already  soldiers got themselves that their spouse or fianc\u00e9' were screwing around. I'd feel sorry for the poor bitch or bastard who'd mess with their source of inspiration. That's all I got to say about it.Things got up and up with the story when they finally got in to the Sandbox. They only decent character is SGT \""Scream\""  the only person who'd has brains. Reminds me of my old Sargent in Desert Storm...took no stuff from my Cherry arse...which reciprocated to myself in Iraq Freedom...when I took charge of my squad. He'd be quite a bit over the top with the screaming (I know  it wouldn't be SGT Scream if he wasn't) but  that's Hollywoodzation.I'd think I would have really busted that female  \""Mrs B\"" for breaking noise discipline which lead to a fire fight. I know my female 'cruits wouldn't ever do such things yet  I know five of my squad in Iraq Freedom were female. With training and discipline  such things were never an issue nor tolerated.At the end of the show  most of the 'cruits got silent. As usual  each time I teach a class or conduct a training  I'd always asked for an AAR (After Action Review). They all agree that the show is not a detailed representation of what the Army stands for. Some honesty came thru with tactics...not a full exact doctrine but  if they wanted to stress on the representation of what our boys really do  have the show's producer go thru mini boot-camp or better yet  have them go Ranger's training like in BLACKHAWK DOWN.My 'cruits graduated the next day and I'm proud to say that they are now Soldiers. Some has issues but  all have heart. I did endorse the show even though it had a lot of discrepancies. No  I didn't tell them they should look at it as a comedy. I told them  the show has some shinning moments and I would be patient enough to withstand it. I just hope they don't put Marines as their technical advisors...HOORAHHH\tUmmmm... Are we all watching the same show? cause the one i watched was god awful.Characters.. lets see..... we have angry yelling Sgt guy  down home Texan guy  smart NY liberal guy with glasses  bad black dude  good black dude  ugly tough chick  and hot chick.... so far  i don't give a damn about any of em.As soon as Texas guy said \""I'm gonna play me some footballs when i get back home\"" it was painfully clear he was loosing a leg. Likewise  when NY glasses wearing liberal guy went on about how much he missed the wife he was fighting with as he left  I saw she slept some guy before they showed it. Want to take bets on that its his best friend? Then  when they talked about pulling an unauthorized \""beer run\"" THATS when Johnny Football was gonna buy it. Oh  and they call him Sgt Scream cause he's the ONLY NCO in the armed forces who yells  ever......The tactics were terrible  the Morters were full of napalm  the writing was on par with those in adult movies  and the acting wasn't much better......the ONLY redeeming quality was when the M203 shot... that was LEGIT!!!!! I'll keep watching  but just to goof on what COULD have been SOOOO GOOD  if the producers would have just read \""Generation Kill\"" before the started filming.\tFor starters i love war movies. Black Hawk down etc.. anything with guns and convoys i'll watch it. That being said i enjoyed the action of the pilot episode  but left my computer to busy myself while they had bad  played-out  clich\u00e9'd dialogue. Why did people have to ask everyone what their nicknames meant? That got really boring.The writer obviously never served in the arm  we all know this series has got massive plot holes. But its for TV  and we can't all have these perfect toy soldiers right? Wheres the drama or excitement in that? They've got to play it up for TV  even if it won't happen in real life.Hopefully some of the larger holes will be filled after a few episodes\tI am an Iraqi War veteran and was part of the 3rd Infantry Division that was first into Baghdad in 2003. For FX to use the 3rd ID patch (which on many actors is not even placed on the uniform correctly) is a disgrace. Every character plays some stereotypical role in this mini-series. From the \""hard-core\"" sergeant that plays the squad leader  to FX's vision of women on the battle field  to the new PFC that has a middle-eastern background  every character plays a part in demeaning the US Army and in my eyes  the 3rd Infantry Division.I would like to know how much investigation and planning went on before FX started to film this poor representation of the military forces deployed in harms way. And not every soldier in the Army has a nickname and soldiers on a whole know their mission  from a PVT all the way to the top Commanders in the Theater. Maybe FX and Stephen Bochco should speak with some of the directors from \""Black Hawk Down\"" or any other successful Military Movie.\tWell  like most things in the military  or maybe in life even  it is \""better in theory than in practice\"". Having just come home from \""Over There\"" myself  I thought this show would be interesting to watch. It really wasn't too bad  with the exceptions of the old clich\u00e9s of the \""military talk\""  the inaccuracies of the Medevac helos (I was stationed at the main trauma center in Baghdad  and the few Hueys I saw did NOT carry patients; also  GLOSSY paint??!?! uh....no...we saw how it reflected off the helo in the sunset...Kevelar paint is used)  the terrain NOT looking like Iraq; poor attempt  and the representations of women. This  being a woman  and having been \""over there\""  was VERY offensive. First off  I will state  I was not in that situation  the whole time I was there...women are not allowed on the front lines--but women have been fighting for the right too for some time. Now  whether or not women will be an asset or not  is another large issue...I don't have space to discuss that---but  I do NOT agree with how they portrayed those two females....thanks  Hollywood for not standing up for women at all! Also  the convoy....I am sorry  it was so ridiculous  I had to laugh!! Prior to going over there myself  we had NUMEROUS  upon NUMEROUS convoy ops classes (I was a part of an ambulance company). you would NEVER pull over--off the road. COME ON!! Soldiers are not that stupid  Hollywood. I think the producers of this show really need to get people that we actually over there--people that we on the front lines...ESPECIALLY people at Walter Reed. I think the concept of the show is good  it really makes the public look at the soldiers--not just the war; because as a soldier myself  I don't believe in the war  but I believe in the soldiers/sailors/airmen/marines. With this  now bring justice to those who are serving or have served  by portraying with the best possible consultants--those from \""Over There\"". P.S. Any of you infantry men out there....does a 50 cal really do that? being at the hospital  we would never get that  if it was that serious. The doubts I am having is that I have treated patients with a 50cal to the face....it was not pretty  but no nearly as bad as the one on the show. Just wondering.\tI am a Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran in the Navy as a combat medic for the Marines.1stf all I thought it was pretty cool to see a show of what is going on in Iraq  but some of the things that I saw were just crazy and not making sense. I honestly think that they should hire some Marines and tell them how to do the show. I know that it is an Army show but I think that the Marines have a better way of showing how it is really done. I don't believe that everyone in the Army has nicknames  it just seems so dumb to do that. Also  that Sgt Scream he would of gotten shot by his platoon if he ever did that in real life you just don't start screaming to your people who are doing your job. Plus you don't know what they might be thinking and going through and then we have \""friendly fire\"". In the first episode when they were in the mosque they should of called for air support and they wouldn't of been there for so many days getting ambushed. I think that this show needs to show what all branches are doing \""over there\""  not just the Army singing and trying to figure each others nicknames. I do applaud that they did put some realistic scenes where the wife is cheating on her husband and having family problems. I also noticed that nothing was dirty in the desert. Their weapons looked like they just came out of the armory after a 3 day stand off at the mosque  the hummers just left the motor pool  their faces didn't have dirt after spending 3 nights in the sand. Last but not least I just want to say to all the Sailors  Marines  Soldiers  and sometimes Airmen GOOD JOB and HOORAH.SEMPER FI By a DEVIL DOC\tTo quote the critically acclaimed Vietnam vetern turned author Tim O'Brien  \""A true story that never happened.\"" Or at least that's what Over There looks to be attempting to be. Sure it won't be 100% factually or technically accurate (c'mon like a test season of a TV show can afford to get a UH Blackhawk rather than a UH-1 Huey etc etc) The pilot episode is enough to catch interest. While the dialogue treads familiar \""war movie clich\u00e9\"" group  the visual presentation is excellent. The show does an excellent job in depicting the dirt  grundge  heat  and freezing nights of the desert. The most effective scenes are the ones with the barest dialogue and everything is shown.Whatever your feelings on the war  the show is worth checking out if only for the fact has rengaged the public to think about the war again (which seems to have been relagated to the back of the collective consciousness). Hopefully it'll live up to the hype. Hopefully it will become the TV analog to the documentary Gunner Palace.\tThe show shows the true reason for us being in Iraq not for oil or money or to look good in front of the world. We are there to stop the suffering of million does anyone think that we should just sit back and allow million s of people to be murdered??? But this is a great show very well made it will keep you on your toes the whole time I can't wait for next Wednesday's episode!!! Steven Bochco and FX certainly did a great job on this and my favorite character is SGT SCREAM he is excellent it shows how hard it is to be a soldier. My cousin just got back from Iraq and he says its the closest thing to the real thing he has seen...\tI genuinely like war and military-themed movies and shows  but this series  at least based on the first episode  is very weak and forgettable. The first episode  just like the first ten minutes of a movie  are crucial to setting up the main plot(s) and introducing the characters. We really get neither here. We're shown a montage of very forgettable faces as they prepare to leave for Iraq and then are dropped smack in the middle of major combat activity. We don't know where exactly and we don't really know why. We aren't told what division these characters are in or what their primary duty is in Iraq. Are these guys and two motor transport female soldiers infantry  will they be providing security  or what. I've never been in the military but I would suppose that platoons are assigned to some sort of specific function but we've no idea what that is here. During the combat  which goes on interminably  we have to endure each character telling us about their silly nicknames; Doublewide? Smokey? Scream? Dim?? Perhaps the writers thought colorful nicknames would make the bland actors and characters stand out more. They don't. After 40 minutes of combat we catch the squad hanging out  just enough time to have a black soldier break into song. Really. Then we're back on the road and they run over a mine and some guy's leg get blown off and I didn't care one iota. I couldn't even tell exactly who it was who got butchered. Bo? Dim? Somebody making scale pay? The problem with this episode is that the grunts just aren't that interesting. The real interesting stuff about Iraq are the politics  public relations  corruption  private armies/security  and high-level wrangling. Iraq could be an interesting setting for a TV show if it followed somebody in a position to interact within all these environments. I give this show five airings before the execs pull the plug.\tOver There looks real  feels real  and sounds real. The writing is over the top and the photography gives you a sense of being there. The main characters are all interesting  the action sequences are well done and well edited  and when the shooting starts  all hell breaks loose. I sat on the edge of my seat for the full hour. If this is what FX Channel has in mind for us  it won't be long before they bury the competition with quality shows like this. They've already begun with programs like The Shield and Rescue Me  and now Over There. Absolutely stunning! Over There is theatrical quality  and great theatrical quality at that. This one gets my highest recommendation!\tHaving served in Iraq  I thought that this might be a pretty good series. Why not? FX generally has great shows. But this one is totally gay. First off  there are no UH-1 (Huey) helicopters used for MEDEVAC in Iraq. What about a two day fire fight without resupply  or support assets? Get real! Sure we still don't have armor on all of our vehicles  but things aren't that jacked up! And what's with the allusion to the \""Hero\"" Jessica Lynch with the ambushed/stranded transportation females? What a crock! Now I understand that Hollywood has to embellish a bit to get the story line going  but honestly keep the political correctness out of it and keep it realistic.I do have to give MAJOR kudos to the scene where after just the first week the soldier's wife is banging another man. Also to showing great carnage of the haji's. I laughed so hard during all of those scenes.It was just the premiere  so hopefully the producers will do a better job of getting the details right. I'll definitely continue to watch.\tI saw the majority of the 1st episode and thought it was a good story line.Some of the dialog between the troops seemed a little stereotypical of \""Army talk\"".As a veteran I am watching with an eye of scrutiny more so than the average schmo.Some errors noticed were the female troops wearing lipstick which is an Army no no especially in a field environment.A medivac helicopter in episode 1 was a UH1 Huey model which may be possible but not likely since the Blackhawk model has been in use since the mid 80's.Some of the background scenery looks oh so California  which as it turns out is California.My biggest concern is the message that this show will be delivering.We have enough crap coming from the news networks that are painting our men and women as ugly tyrants.We don't need a show to reinforce the lies and the negativity of our mission.Agree with it or not our troops are doing their mission and not asking for approval.I hope the producers of this show keep it real without some political agenda.If week after week turns out to be gloom and doom with depressing overtones of \""how bad it all is..Over There..\"" dump this show from your viewing schedule. Great widescreen presentation  good music and story flow so far.\tThe show within itself is not bad  but unfortunately it has one major flaw that is so common with military movies  and that is it does not portray the soldiers as people with any intelligence or individuality. The soldiers in the show are portrayed as reservists (i'm assuming they are reservist) that are just plucked up out of their hometown and dropped into a firefight in Iraq with no training  no experience  and unable to function without the input of a salty  seasoned Sergeant. I am a Sergeant in the Marines  and I have been \""over there\""  and I also happen to be a reservist. While I have to admit we had our scary times  there was never an air of helplessness  and every one is required to be able to think. Everyone has a job  we are not just identical pegs that are interchangeable being controlled by some guy that yells a lot. If I were to treat my Marines like that  they would shoot me. Also  the show has some serious tactical errors as far as the rules for convoy operations are concerned and how they are conducted on the roads. The soldier's attitudes were portrayed as naive and ignorant of any of their training or of where they were. For instance  if someone saw someone doing something suspicious on the side of the road  first there wouldn't be a question of \""are you sure?\"" we NEVER question what someone sees  we investigate everything- even if it may be someone' imagination. Second  why would the truck pull onto the shoulder of the road? You just saw something placed there. We NEVER pull onto the shoulder unless we have no choice and if we do pull onto the shoulder  we stop IMMEDIATELY. Third  the people in the back of the truck were just sitting and chatting... How about pulling some security duty by pointing your weapon outboard and scanning for IED's and enemy threats. Fourth  what was with the cammie-netting on the back of the truck? we never do that in a hostile environment because that netting can catch a grenade if one is dropped from a bridge. This just scratches the surface. My point is there needs to be a show that accurately depicts a military units day to day activities and interactions. We are PROFESSIONALS in the military  we each know our jobs  we each have unique jobs and responsibilities  and we a re proud of that. We are not drones that are screamed at by some \""Sergeant\"" that doesn't know our name. One other thing  all convoys had at least 4 escorts. I know  it sounds like I am hard to please  but I feel like shows like this are made to portray me and my fellow warriors. If that is the case  then lets get it right. We deserve it.\tConsidering that Steven Bochco was the brains and the muscle behind \""Hill Street Blues\""  I had very high hopes for \""Over There\"".I was sadly disappointed. Maybe Bochco was looking for the anonymity of Hill Street by focusing on an unidentified Active  Guard or Reserve Unit sent to Iraq. Having been in Active and presently Reserve duty. The idea that no one knows one another's name or nickname within a unit is ludicrous.Whoever is the \""Technical Adviser\"" to the series hasn't a clue as to distance and interval while approaching an objective. Nor about Convoy Procedures (The vehicle in the lead is to be chased. Slowing down and pulling over is verboten! And in the case of an lamely marked IED actually going off; a Defensive Perimeter is immediately set to protect the stranded vehicle!)That said  \""Over There\"" is a lamely written and researched re-hash of \""Combat!\"" or \""Tour Of Duty\"". Though \""Combat\"" and \""Tour Of Duty\"" were infinitely better!As soon as I heard that \""Bo\"" had been a Quaterback in High School  I knew that he would lose a leg through some mishap. I wasn't disappointed.The \""Mosque\"" that was the squad's objective could have easily have been the Machine Gun Nest/Bunker/Listening Post from \""Combat!\"" An essential  possibly Pyrrhic Victory.In other words: Nothing really new and very poorly executed!My suggestion would be to send a team of writers for \""Over There\"" to either Letterman or Walter Reed Army Medical Center and talk to wounded returning soldiers from Iraq. Instead of depending on a hack's imagination!\tIt is SO evident that no one associated with this show ever spent a day in any kind of uniform service. The mistakes have largely been covered but here are some of the most glaring errors.1. Sergeants just don't yell at people like that. That happens during Basic and that is about it. 2. Troops don't bicker like that with each other. Tempers will flare but Bochco's show has everyone looking like a temperamental five year old. 3. SECURITY--this means when someone digs a hasty fighting position  someone else is pulling security. Not everyone digs at the same time. 4. Why is the LT dealing with the squad leader directly instead of with his Platoon Sergeant? 5. Are these guys Active or Reserve or Guard or what? The implication is that they are 3rd Infantry. Is this the reason they act like they have no clue what is going on? Gimme a break... 6. Soldiers rarely discuss politics at all  period. In the middle of a fight  I really doubt that a sergeant would voice his concerns about \""No War for Oil\"" or whatever he said. 7. The whole IED scene was rubbish. That has been beat to death already.On the positive side  you do get to see a fairly accurate depiction of a .50 cal round impacting a human torso. Also  good job of showing females in a rifle squad fouling up terribly. Just about every one I have ever been around would look pretty much like the two weak  emotional wrecks on the TV show.I give this show one more week before I pull the plug on it permanently.\tI've watched every episode of this show so far  and I'm very conflicted. On the one hand  I think the characters are very well written (except for the black guy who's an *beep* that guy's so racist they might as well have had him played by a white man in black face)  I think the drama is good  I think it says something about the nature of war  and think it's a very good show on the whole. There's just one problem. What it's saying about Iraq is a TOTAL AND COMPLETE LIE. Now  don't get me wrong. I'm a big old liberal. I protested this war. My parents protested Vietnam. I was raised Orthodox hippie  it's freaking in my blood to hate war. However  I don't believe in just blatantly lying. I have two friends over in Iraq  one in the British Army  one in the American. They both say this show is totally inaccurate. The Roadblock Duty episode would never have happened  they portrayed the treatment of that prisoner as if it were policy (for all of you who are about to scream Abu Ghraib  that was not our policy)  and as for the first episode  no soldier would ever be thrown into combat that quickly. Also  beyond all this  it's in EXTREMELY bad taste to do a show about a war already in progress. It's just not right. There's no way Chris Gerolmo knows whats going on over there completely  because NO ONE ever knows that about a war until years later. Any of you ever seen M*A*S*H? That show takes place in Korea. It was started during Vietnam. Anyone with half a brain knows that it was about Vietnam  not Korea  but the people doing the show had the good sense and common decency to set it in Korea. This meant they could pretty much have whatever they wanted happen  because the war was over 20 years ago  and they wouldn't be insulting any current military men. I am anti-war  but I'm not anti- military. This show is a slap in the face to anyone in the military right now  and it's shameful. If you want to do a film about the Middle East conflict  I've got an idea. Why don't you make a show about the Middle East in World War One. You know  the time when England and France went in and divided up the whole area  creating all the countries that exist today? The time when we Westerners treated the whole area as our war prize and chopped it up into pieces like a pizza? You know  the basic reason why this whol"
Red Eye (2005),"I went in not knowing what to expect... especially after Cursed (which was a more entertaining movie the second time around with the gore intact). Red Eye was one of the most entertaining movies I have sat through in a really long time. I would even pay to see it when it is actually released because I liked it that much. I have not been to a movie where the crowd was cheering  screaming  and applauding the screen so much. The leads were terrific... the plot was interesting  the tension was riveting... all in all  a great summer movie worth your money!GO see it!\tI saw Red Eye tonight at a sneak preview with a group of friends and everyone in our party thought it was excellent. The movie holds your attention throughout the entire time and the characters are so believable that you really get into the movie. Red Eye is definitely a must-see for the summer of 2005 and I would recommend this film to anyone! I can't remember when I have gone to a film and been held in suspense like I was during the 2 hours that I watched this film. Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy are perfect against one another and Wes Craven has done an excellent job in directing. This is going to be a major hit  in my opinion. Plan to see it when it comes out in mid-August!\tAfter seeing this film  which I was really looking forward to  I felt like I was on a real red-eye flight. I was tired  cranky and needed a shower. The movie was a big disappointment. I expected more from Wes Craven  who just recently gave us \Cursed.\"" I'm still forgiving him for that. Granted  this film has a few good moments  but it turned into the \""Scream\"" films near the end with the two main players fighting each other with a few scares thrown in for good measure. (The Scream series was also done by Mr. Craven  who did an awesome job!) Some of the dialog was painful and the story  as intricate as it tried to be  just didn't suck you in. You really didn't care what happened to the characters. Honestly  this could have been a movie of the week. Red Eye has been done before under different titles with a tweaked  better story  and it's been done better. I really expected more from Mr. Craven.\tThe film is a mess -- again. 'Cursed' failed on so many levels and this follows suit. In our jaded times  we as audience members will not succumb to the B-grade horror antics which could make a poor movie digestible twenty years ago. Not today though. There is no direction in a mud puddle. We see no force driving the movie to its foregone conclusion. We're not all on the same page people.I am talking about a screenplay that wastes too much time and expected thrills which simply aren't there. Unbelievable acting  fake looking F/X and a general feeling of boredom permeate the film. And as for Cillian Murphy  he did a poor job in Batman and repeats that performance here. Frankly  I don't get the attraction Hollywood seems to have for him. None the less  a thrill movie should have some good thrills. And I wonder how quickly this film was made  after it was announced Jodie Foster would be making Flightplan.\tI also just got back from an advanced screening of Redeye and I must say I haven't had so much fun at a movie in a long time. WES CRAVEN is at his best ever. He brings us an amazing end of summer thriller I was so desperately craving. This is THE thriller of the year..no doubt. All the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun. The F/X were great. It steadily built suspense. I was on the edge of my seat most of the movie. It's been a while since I heard an audience cheer and clap and get excited in a theater. If your looking for thrills action and a GOOD plot this summer  REDEYE delivers. Go see it!\tAfter seeing the trailer to this film back in March  I was eagerly anticipating viewing the entire production. But you what they say about watching what you wish for.Horror mogul Wes Craven (the man behind such modern classics as \""The Last House on the Left \"" \""Swamp Thing \"" \""Nightmare On Elm Street\"" and \""Scream \"" among many others) decides to do away with his usual blend of blood-dripping  headless  mangled corpses and focus instead on making a psychological thriller.He should have stuck to what he does best  as he's no Hitchcock. In fact  he's not even a De Palma.Plot has Lisa Reisert (\""Wedding Crashers \"" \""Mean Girls \"" \""The Hot Chick\"") as a harried hotel executive traveling from Atlanta to Miami after the death of her (unseen) grandmother. Forced to take the late night (red eye) flight because of bad weather delays  she meets the charming and creepily-handsome Jackson Rippner (get it?!)  played by Cilliam Murphy (Scarecrow in \""Batman Begins\"")  who shares a drink and (conveniently) an airplane seat with her.While these two make goo-goo eyes at one another  Lisa has arranged for the Director of Homeland Security (see how topical it is)  to be taken care of in her absence.All is going well with this budding relationship until things take a rather nasty turn and Lisa very life is in danger  as well as her father  Joe (Brian Cox  \""Braveheart \"" \""Rushmore \"" \""Nuremberg \"" \""The Bourne Supremacy\"").Forced to commit a heinous act or lose her dad  Lisa tries several ways to extricate herself from the situation  including scribbling a note inside a Dr. Phil (more topical subjects) book and writing a soapy note on the aircraft's bathroom mirror. Unfortunately  her adversary is much smarter and thwarts her at every turn.While the jet is in flight  the suspense builds and we are treated to some real thrills (most of which come by trying to figure out what's going to happen next). But  like any other flight from Atlanta to Miami  the plane has to land - and when this one does  the plot comes tumbling down with it. Next time  Mr. Craven should base the premise on a flight from  say  Atlanta to New Zealand.Yes  friends  when the story reaches sea level it becomes nothing more than a goofy series of \""Home Alone\"" sequences and revenge scenes  with the helpless Lisa turning into a tigress  while her father spends a great deal of time lying on the floor. Worst of all  the adversary - so clever and dangerous on the airplane  becomes the single most inept bad guy in film history once he's on the ground.Political intrigue  assassination attempts  explosions  gun fights  and other various types of violence cannot hide the fact that this is Craven' weakest effort in quite a few years.\t\""Red Eye\"" flashes forwards almost two decades ago to find new train attendant Mi Sun as she takes the last train of the day in a torrential downpour.Things seem normal at first but suddenly the train begins to stop every ten minutes.Strangely when the train resumes its course everything inside has changed.In the late 80's a horrific train accident resulted in the death of a hundreds victims.The cause of the disaster was never determined and the case became unsolved.\""Red Eye\"" by Kim Dong Bin is almost a typical haunted house flick.There's the strange noise and glimpses of something dark and horrifying the passengers of the train get increasingly disturbed and those who wander off by themselves meet a gruesome end.The train setting provides some spooky moments and there is enough creepiness to satisfy fans of Asian horror.Give it a look.8 out of 10.\tWith breathless propaganda on one side and jaded boredom on the other  it's hard to make heads or tails of the comments so far. I personally think it's a solid  surprisingly nuanced film. It has some logic holes  and Brian Cox is woefully underused  but it's otherwise a fine way to spend some time in the theater. I saw it tonight at an advanced screening  and it seemed to be a crowd pleaser. People hooted  screamed  applauded  and gasped.I think the camera was just about glued to McAdams the whole time  but that's not so bad because she's very attractive. The film style is pretty claustrophobic for most of the film  and Craven was meticulous in capturing the quirks of human nature and how people really interact. His grasp of behavior makes for some very authentic and entertaining interactions  and he builds on each scene involving the co-stars  resulting in some satisfyingly fist-shaking conclusions to their sub-plots. It's also amazing how much plot and characterization he was able to pack into a relatively short film. Red Eye is dense with detail  and you really have to keep your eyes on the screen the whole time if you want to keep up.His career has been all over the map  quality-wise  and I'm glad to see him finally move away from high concept shlock  market-tested alt-rock soundtracks  random assortments of Young Beautiful People as his principals  and embarrassingly crappy scripts. It's almost as if someone else directed the film  chose the material  and approved the cast. I expected Murphy to be competent  but I was really impressed by McAdams. I haven't seen The Notebook yet  but I think this will be her breakout role. I found her harrowingly convincing  up until the end.While I see her motivations from the director's point of view  I don't think the depth of her capabilities was sufficiently established for me to fully believe she could do what she ended up doing. I think the problem is that Craven is just not used to this kind of endgame territory. Hopefully he'll keep at it  though  because this is the best film of his I've seen since the original Scream. Unfortunately  judging by the list of films he's on track to produce  this looks like a thematic one-off for a career slashmeister.\tI saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight. I absolutely loved it. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night. Cillian Murphy is extremely creepy as the villain. For those of you who have seen Batman Begins  his character was much scarier in this film. He played his character very well. The scariest \""bad guy \"" I have seen in awhile. Rachel McAdams was great. Everyone in the audience laughed  gasped and cheered at the same time  as if we were on cue. The suspense is held through out the movie. THe amazing part is that the end was not anti-climatic. I was not disappointed in the end. I felt satisfied. The trailer does not do the movie justice. The movie is much better than the trailer indicated. Do not wait for this movie to come out on video. Go see it. Although  I did not have to pay to see this movie  I would have gladly given 10.75 to see it. Enjoy!\tLet us get a few things out of the way. Craven is known for his mastery over thrillers and horrors  but lately his movies have been failing. It is almost as if he has lost his touch. With this movie  he only gains it back a little. On a plane  a young woman is forced to take a part of a menacing plan of a killer. That is a somewhat interesting story. It could have been an interesting movie. But before I get into that  I'll talk about the good things this has in it. First of all  Murphy plays an excellent (and creepy) bad guy. I have to give him that  especially after this and his performance as the Scarecrow in Batman Begins. But even with his talent for evil  this movie is just not very attention-grabbing. It has a good setting and atmosphere--in a plane  close to many other people  claustrophobia  terror...things like that. It is just what happens in this movie that makes it not that great. It is very predictable and the choices that the main lady makes are sometimes pretty lame. The movie takes a totally different turn during the last half hour and it is not a very good one. It just becomes bland and you know what is going to happen  and you're just waiting for it to happen. This could have been an intense and very tight thriller that keeps us on their edge of our seat  but it is only something to watch with a notch of thrills. After seeing this  you might just want to get a bit of shut eye. It is forgettable and nothing really special at all. Murphy is beautiful and eerie  but if you want to see him as a bad guy  see him in Batman. If not even the previews caught your attention  then you should move on. This movie is NOT bad. It has its moments. But it could have been more intriguing. Craven could have done a lot better than this. But if you are a fan of his or if you like cheap thrills with predictability  then you may like this movie =) 6/10 Stars\tRed Eye was such a thrill  edge-of-your-seat movie. You always want to know what Lisa (Rachel McAdams) will do next. Cillian Murphy is the perfect actor for this part  using his charm to capture Lisa's trust in the beginning of the movie  and turning his personality completely around. Rachel McAdams is great in the movie  every emotion in Lisa being captured wonderfully. Red Eye will truly show everyone that Rachel can do it all.. romance  comedy  thrill  drama...shes the next big star.. AND shes from Canada!! Thats always a plus!! I don't watch much of Wes Cravens movies but after seeing Red Eye. i think i'll go rent some of his classics! All in all  if your looking to get a good thrill by watching a movie  go see Red Eye. Its worth it!\tWow  stepping aboard another airplane at LAX will never be the same again after catching Wes Craven's tension filled RED EYE and feeling like a passenger in the seat behind the lovely Rachel McAdams and her monster of a fellow passenger in Cillian Murphy as they head to Miami.Rachel McAdams gives a stunning performance  first  rather weak and timid  but as Murphy begins to terrorize her  you see that when she is threatened  the strength of her character rises to the surface  and the fight begins aboard a very crowded plane  turbulence in the cabin which stirs up the tension on the screen. Nail biting time here.The plane ride is very real to any person who has traveled today-surly flight attendants  passengers who lug too heavy luggage aboard  and in the midst of this is the plot which unfolds from Cillian Murphy  who with those incredible blue eyes  just freezes you in your seat.The film is action packed  the plane ride tense and frightening  which serves as a perfect backdrop for the story to advance  and the final scenes on the ground lead to an exciting and breathtaking finish.Kudos to Wes Craven and the talents of the stunning Rachel McAdams  who from the beautiful love story  THE NOTEBOOK  to RED EYE  just lights up the screen.And be sure to check who is the passenger next to you on a future flight. If it is Cillian Murphy  my advice  change your seat.\tYeah  okay  so you pretty much know how this movie's going to end 5 minutes in. Usually I'd say that's a bad thing  but in this case it works. To steal a quote from \""Firefly\""  the journey's the worthier part. This movie's got surprises in all the right places  it's got scares in all the right places  and really isn't the definition of suspense that you know what's going to happen but the characters don't? I've read a few reviews that trash the last 20 min  once the plane lands  as generic and thoughtless but I disagree. After 70 min of tension and suspense you *want* to see Lisa fight back and boy does she. If you want Shakespeare go see Shakespeare. If you want to be entertained by a tightly composed suspense thriller go see 'Red Eye'.\tI would agree with most of the critics and say it is a B-movie  but it's one of those great B-movies. Cillian Murphy is just brilliant in his role. His lines are great  he says them with wit and overall creepiness. His big blue eyes and the charm that oozes out  hook you. I'm sure that this will be the film that rises him further to the top  though I wish he'd been discovered more through his Irish films  as they were also great. Rachel McAdams has an aura about her that just makes you want to watch her all the time - as seen in The Notebook and Wedding Crashers. She plays terrified convincingly but stands up and shows some girl power. In the end  I hope this movie does well because it deserves to. It's short but it's engaging  especially with certain scenes. The idea of the film is a good one  and it's been done right in my opinion.\tMy goodness is this movie bad. I was totally misled by my local movie review because this is certifiable garbage. Yeah  yeah  good guys wear white  bad guys wear black....and the good guys always win. Now go home and hug your kids  and feel how good Hollywood has made you feel. Blech! I can't believe this brain dead movie was made by Wes Craven. I'm guessing he needed a little money to pay the mortgage  so he made this piece of dung. It is the sort of production that makes anyone who watches movies regularly believe they could do as good or better than such an experienced director.Ya see  a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves her daddy to do a wittle IL' bad thing or he's gonna hurt her daddy. But being Ms. All-American girl next door  we know she's gonna save the day and beat the bad guys...the end. Girl power ROCKS.C'mon now  only an idiot would find this entertaining...\""a roller coaster ride \"" let alone something fresh or new. All those \""super-duper\"" reviews you see on this site are from industry hacks who are either making money off this flick  paying back a favor  or they have sold their souls to the devil.Rachael McAdams is beautiful....yup  that's it. Not a good performance  not a horrible one...she's just cute. She would have had to show a whole lot of skin to save this movie. She isn't tough enough to be a good female action lead.Cillian Murphy was at least passable in 28 Days. But here he plays a dumb villain pretending to be a smart one. He gets his ass kicked to and fro by the 5'5'' McAdams  because after all  she was a cheerleader...and a field hockey player...and I'm sure she owns all the Tae Bo tapes...so she should be able to kick the crap out of an international terrorist for hire. I wouldn't trust him to steal a pack of gum from 7-11.Ya see  this movie was done before  except before they did it well. Go re-rent any of the Die Hard movies. You have loved ones in danger  international terrorists  except the characters are more likable and believable and the bad guys are WAY more competent and interesting. I simply don't understand how Hollywood can continue to make such crap as if they were oblivious to the proper models they can readily copy. No wonder movie revenues are down.Throw your $6 down the toilet and save yourself 2 hours of your life you'll never get back.ciao  FreddyShoop\tI managed to luck out and see this movie on a \""sneak peek\"" night  and I'm glad  because I would have been rather upset had I spent money to see this.I miss the days when Wes Craven made movies that made my skin crawl. This film was very easy to predict  right down to the stabbing in the neck with the pen.The first part of the movie seems to drag a bit - you can figure out what's up rather early on. I have to admit  I simply loved Jayma May's character  Cynthia...she and her wide eyes managed a giggle every time from me.The film also plays a lot of old clich\u00e9s over & over - terrorists wanting to kill a high ranking gov't official  with the classic shoulder rocket launcher. We get an impressive explosion - but remarkably  with no one getting off the floor  no on is killed.Save this one for a rental.\tYou get Wes Craven's latest psychological thriller! This one  in the same vein as Alfred Hitchcock's \""The Man Who Knew Too Much.\"" Only  instead of Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day as vacationing parents  we get Rachel McAdams as Lisa Riesert. A Floridian hotel manager  returning from her maternal grandmother's funeral in Texas. You can't help identifying with her everyday troubles (like impossible-to-please customers)  because almost everyone of us has gone through them  ourselves. But  how many of us have been extorted by a professional mercenary into being an accomplice to assassination? That's what Cillian Murphy (\""Batman Begins\"") does  as Jackson Rippner. In less than thirty seconds of small talk  he goes from charming stranger to morbid jokester to stone-cold b**t**d. And  the battle of wits Lisa engages him in  aboard the late-night flight  provides half the riveting suspense of this future classic. The rest comes from the literal race-against-time after the plane lands in Miami! In short  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who's looking for edge-of-your seat escapism. Just make sure the movie theater where you see it has a decent sound system. The one in which my hometown multiplex presented it conked out during the most crucial part of the assassination scene!\tI hate to use that clich\u00e9 but this movie will grab your attention and not let go until it ends! An enjoyable ride that starts off slowly then builds tension to a good effect. Although you do not learn too much history about the \""bad guy\"" nor are the motives for the main plot point fully explained. This however may not be a bad thing since it leaves mystery and add to the suspense. Most of the movie takes place in the airplane and the claustrophobic way this is filmed makes one uncomfortable and the story unfolds. Minor note  some bits shown in the trailer for this movie does not actually appear in the movie. The acting is great by both main actors and the story flows well to a \""edge of your seat\"" if not predictable conclusion. This story is well told  acted and directed and I recommend it to anyone interested in a good end-of-the-summer thriller.\tI really liked this movie. It has so much action  so much suspense  non-stop interest. And can be enjoyed at so many levels.For one thing  this is just a helluva good thriller. Full of heart-pounding excitement  scary moments  twists and turns.For another  if you like great characterization  I think Rachel MacAdams is really just outstanding: she conveys so many emotions  so effectively  so convincingly. By turns she's shy and flirtatious; wistful and romantic; surprised and astonished; horrified and shocked; terrified and ashamed; perceptive and challenging; crafty and insightful; aggressive and persistent. Just a wonderful portrayal of a thoroughly engaging character.There's an interesting sub-dynamic involving past victimization of Rachel's character  that meshes with the face value dynamics of present victimization; and the way she works through both at the same time.There's a wonderful historical dynamic that makes for a third meshing dynamic: 9/11. From the early entry of the Department of Homeland Security to the gradual unfolding of the primary scenes: airport  aircraft  tall building. The evocation of 9/11 ... and post-9/11 ... is everywhere  without being at all heavy-handed and without any trace of failure to dovetail neatly into the primary here-and-now plot unfolding in each of these scenes.The way in which proceed the Victimizer in the present  paralleling the past Victimizer of Rachel  and the past Victimizer(s) of New York on 9/11  is chilling and frightening and (initially) overwhelming. The Rachel character rises to the occasion  though  and clearly establishes herself as Victim-No-More: something she explicitly declares at one point.The scene in the house is (at one level) a very familiar one in the annals of Thrillers; but differs in the sheer intensity and skill and aggressiveness and intelligence and commitment of the Rachel character as she establishes clearly that Terror will not win over her; or indeed over our country.I don't want to give away the denouement  but the final scene with the Rachel-character and her would-be Victimizer is truly rich with things that are human  authentic  and (let it be said) American.What a wonderful movie ... this one I'll probably have to go see again in theatres ... and when it's out on DVD  I'm getting it  it's a keeper.\tRed Eye  is about a young woman named Lisa Reisert  who works at a big hotel. After a death in the family Lisa  is returning home on a flight. The flight is cancelled and before it is boarded again she meets a man named Jackson Rippner  who she seems to find charming and soon begins to like. They sit together on the flight once it re-boards and soon she finds out that he knows a lot about her and that there is a reason for this and if she does not help him in the killing of a wealthy executive then she and her father are in danger. I went into Red Eye  thinking that it would be a good thriller coming from director Wes Craven  who has directed some of my favourite horror films including The Last House On The Left  The Hills Have Eyes and A Nightmare On Elm Street. I was however really disappointed with Red Eye. The film's two stars Rachel McAdams (Lisa) and Cillian Murphy (Jackson) both do a good job and the film isn't badly made but the film's script needs work. One of my complaints about the film is that it is too short. It feels rushed and like we don't get to know the characters that well and the more we would know about the characters and what was going on I probably would have liked it more. The film isn't very thrilling or exciting and doesn't really start to pick up steam till the last ten minutes or so. The film also somewhat feels recycled and like nothing really new. Wes Craven's other film this year Cursed  was given terrible reviews by critics but I quite liked it (keeping in mind I saw the unrated version) and I didn't really like Red Eye  but critics liked that. Go figure. I hope for Wes Craven's next project he goes back to directing horror a genre he knows best and not try a poorly written psychological thriller like this one again."""
Requiem for a Dream (2000),"First of all i think the Turkish audience should very sad because it wasn't shown in turkey.however i started to be interested in movies one fellow suggested that movie and i watched it's DVD.after i watched the movie i couldn't get up from my chair.i stopped in front of the TV looking at the empty screen.it's the most dramatic film i've ever seen.i also have to confess that THE MUSIC had an incredible effect on the impact of the film on the audience.it's the best rhythm i've ever heard in a movie.then i saw the movie many times especially the last 25 minutes because at those times Aronofsky combines the dreams and the reality in a very quick way.while even you are watching your heart start to beat at least 100 times by the the camera's action filming.i also think that whatever or however you talk about the movie it's nothing but word wilderness.hence all i wanna say everybody especially the young and the addictions must see the movie.maybe they will be scared what the movie involves may be their end!!!\tIt is rare in the world of film that I see a movie that  after I've watched it  I can say  \Christ that was a powerful movie!\"" I've seen my share of tear-jerker's  dramas  comedy's  action/adventure  et cetera and even though I cannot say that this movie is one of my all-time favorites I can say that it is a film that sticks with you long after you have finished it. I will also tell you that I honestly couldn't bring myself to watch this movie a second time; it just has such a raw intensity to it and the ending scenes hit you so hard that you're not sure whether to cry or cringe.It was the mother in this film  though  that really got me. You are introduced to her as a sad  lonely mother who has nothing but good intentions in what she does. And as her story concludes at the end you will want to do nothing but mourn at the unfairness of it all. Of course most of this applies to the rest of the main characters as well. One specific scene  though  when the mother (and you'll know what I'm talking about when you watch it) is giving a speech to her son is really just what broke my heart and nearly brought me to tears.I give this movie a 10 because (1) it was just so damn powerful and (2) also because I have never seen another movie quite like it. And also all of the actors performed perfectly.Requiem for a Dream will get inside your head and stick there  oozing around (to be a little blatant). And (borrowing a line from \""Fight Club) It's like that scratch on the top of your mouth that would go away if only you could stop tonguing it...but you can't\""\tStarted to watch this one  after being recommended by friends and reviews i've read but was not amused. I was really BORED with it (so much that I could not resist to fast-forward  almost never happens). I agree that the plot (and trailer) promises an interesting movie to watch. But: no funny dialogs at all  flat characters  the actors we're not interesting at all. I could really not care for the boy. I could really not care for his mum. How do you show the effect of drug abuse? By showing eyeballs? Wanna see a good  gripping movie about drug abuse? Try Trainspotting and you'll also laugh your pants off!\tThere are many fine montages in \""Requiem for a Dream \"" edited rapidly and done repetitiously in a way that conveys a point explicitly within a few seconds (whereas most movies would take the more conventional  straight exposition route); however  some of these montages whiz by to the point where they lack clarity. For instance  there is a scene early in the film where Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto with a Brooklyn accent) and Tyrone Love (Marlon Wayans in a non-comedic role) are shown hanging around a closed carnival booth after dark--we see hands pull something from behind tires (and also what appear to be garbage cans) and then rip open clear plastic pouches of cocaine or heroin while car alarms blare over the soundtrack. Maybe I'm not astute enough to realize what is going on (are they stealing and selling car stereos to help finance Marion Silver's (Jennifer Connelly) break into the garment business? what?)  but that leads to my overall impression of \""Requiem for a Dream\"": the details of the plot are consistently choppy  but ultimately irrelevant. Like the drug-addled culture it at first panders to  then thunderously condemns  \""Requiem\"" is more about the propulsive powers of addiction than a straightforward narrative--in essence  any narrative that emerges is an outgrowth of the characters' actions  and in the end  things are wrapped up in a bleak  downbeat way (really the only possible conclusion that can be reached). Co-writer/director Darren Aronofsky (who cut his teeth on the stylish but showy black-and-white psychodrama \""Pi\"") uses every stylistic device imaginable to convey the escalating effects of addiction (passages of drug use are signaled by montages of prepping heroin works  rolling blunts  and excited cells in the bloodstream); anyone who has had even a passing infatuation with illegal substances will be surprised at the accuracy with which this is conveyed--Aronofsky's decision to speed up or slow down film  use a fisheye lens  steadicam shots  or even show waves of heat rising from a closed refrigerator  successfully hypnotizes the viewer in a manner as gripping as a dissolved drug. The characters  and the paths they have chosen (including Ellen Burstyn--who really WAS robbed of an Oscar--as a widower who becomes addicted to diet pills) are compelling  misguided  and all too human; their rationale for remaining hooked on the substances that ultimately determine their downfall is a fascinating mix of human loyalty  commitment  and betrayal. Aronofsky's visual attentiveness doesn't detract a bit from the finely-wrought performances on display  and rather complements the characters and heightens our own cinematic high. Its overriding theme aside  \""Requiem for a Dream\"" is an artistic triumph and a masterpiece of cinema that is better experienced than described.\tthis movie make's me sic - a 'real life movie' to real for me  not bad just to real  is very boring  they try to make a unique movie   they try to muchthis movie make's me sic - a 'real life movie' to real for me  not bad just to real  is very boring  they try to make a unique movie   they try to muchthis movie make's me sic - a 'real life movie' to real for me  not bad just to real  is very boring  they try to make a unique movie   they try to muchsic sic sic movie - not to see\tMy friends and I joke that this movie should take the place of the Dare program  but with the intense visuals  engaging story and characters  and the last 15 minutes  I can't help but to wonder.The story revolves around four individuals (Jared Leto  Marlon Wayans  Jennifer Connoly  and Ellyn Burnstyn) who become victims of their own addictions (Heroin  Cocaine  and Diet Pills)  and thus begins the downward spiral. I'm not going to go into great detail about the spiral  because  quite frankly  it's not something I want to think about.The combination of great acting with superb directing is what places this film among some of the best ever committed to celluloid. What particularly surprised me was Marlon Wayans; having only seen him in dumb comedies (Scary Movie 1 & 2  Don't be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the 'Hood)  he actually proves his acting chops in this role. This isn't to diminish the other actors  though. After all  \""Requiem\"" is an ensemble effort.Arronofsky really takes care in building up the characters before breaking them down  and by the end  you're left with nothing but a requiem.On a side note: I've sat through slasher flicks  I've seen my share of ghost stories and psychological thrillers  but this is the only movie to date that has ever given me nightmares. If that doesn't say anything about a movie  I don't know what does.\tThis movie goes there. It reaches into your mouth  yanks out your heart and stomps on it with stilleto heels.Nothing can match the way this movie demonstrates the wrath of addiction. This addiction which lies completely in the characters own minds; eating them away. The characters are just ordinary helpless people with the junkie factor is thrown in there  making them unlovable. Regardless  you find yourself falling in love and becoming completely attached to them. This is probably due to the fact of the brilliant acting done  especially by Ellen Burstyn. She really is Sara Goldfarb in this movie. Also Jennifer Connelly is beautiful in that dirty junky way and plays her part perfectly. Jared Leto does a fine job  and not to mention is quite the looker in this movie. Also  I was surprised with how well Marlon Wayans did in such a serious role.I don't want to spoil anything because this movie is best when you don't know what the f*ck is going to be thrown at you (which is how I viewed it; it was just a blockbuster movie picked at random  I didn't even read what it was about!) so be ready for the trip of you lifetime.\tI'm going to skip the synopsis and get straight to the review - if you need the detailed background info  look at the other comments or go to the \""Requiem\"" IMDb home page.This movie is hands down amazing.If you're shallow  you will watch and leave in disgust an hour or so into the movie.If you have the capacity for engrossing  deep  personal  disturbing dramas  you will be glued to your seat in amazement.This movie is both physically and emotionally beautiful - the directing and camera-work is unbelievably executed. The great use of editing and filming styles takes a good drug drama to an awe-inspiring one. If you're a fan of artful photography and directing your jaw will be ON THE FLOOR for the whole movie. The sheer style this movie shows is incredible  from the first moment the Summer Overture kicks in to the very last  frantic  depressing second in which the film ends.The acting is top-notch. These might just be the roles of a lifetime for most of the actors/actresses in Requiem. It's hard to take your eyes off of Ellen Burstyn in the scenes she is in - her emotion and sincerity is great. It gets better as she falls deeper into drug addiction - her acting as a upper-junkie is mind blowing.Jared Leto  Marlon Wayans  and Jennifer Connelly all do an amazing job in the roles that they play - the desperation and sickness comes out brilliantly for all of these actors. One of the best scenes  without a doubt  is when Harry (Jared Leto) confronts Sara (Burstyn) about her addiction to \""uppers\"" when he realizes she's grinding her teeth - you can clearly see that Harry is distraught. It's perfect acting on both parts - many props to Jared and Ellen for that.The climax is probably the best part of the movie. That is  of course  if you can handle it.It is the most harrowing climax to a movie I have ever seen. That's actually an understatement.It's disturbing  controversial  depressing  disgusting  revolting  and most of all just FRANTIC - and that's what makes it so good.The whole thing will make your heart and mind want to burst until the last second when everything crescendos into a mass of hopelessness  and the end credits roll.It's a moment you'll never forget.\tThe outline of this movie is basically this... A lonely older woman named Sara Goldfarb is trying to lose weight and decides to take weight-loss pills... all the while not knowing her son  Harry  and his friend Ty  are becoming drug dealers.I saw this movie today and it is definitely one of the better substance abuse movies. It also shows the negative effects of drugs more graphicly than any movie I have ever seen. Id say 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'The Basketball Diaries' are the two drug movies that I would actually recommend seeing. There isn't much action in this film  but it is by no means boring. You really feel sorry for Sara. But... IF YOU CANT HANDLE DISTURBING DEPRESSING MOVIES  DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. Overall  its a movie that might change you and will leave you thinking. Id put it somewhere in between the top 20 and 30 movies I've ever seen.\tThe movie is about drugs and how they ruin your dreams  not like that commercial where the kid has a little weed and blows off his head  the hard stuff that is actually addicting. Throughout the movie people get protrade in a very real light. This is no stupid would never happen movie  it is a happens millions of times a day type of movie.It does get a little too real at times and made me wish that this was some horrible piece of fiction but it is far too real. I wish that the world didn't have the dark little corners like this that aren't really corners  their more like most of the room making the lighted bits seem very bright.The movie is definitely my favorite  and I don't like picking favorites or even making a top list its more like there is \""Requiem For A Dream\"" then there is everything else. Although you do have to have a strong stomach for it. Even the music is really good  I own the CD but haven't found a good copy of the movie to buy  nobody around stocks the full version. I also believe that everybody  with a strong stomach and who would care  should watch this.Oh and don't take my word for it  go out and rent it. Plus I don't normally agree with age restrictions but this is a definite 15+  14 pushing it. However it is entirely your decision.\tThis is a truly brilliant film with fabulous performances from all the cast members involved in it.The best performance has to be Jennifer Connelly's  she has by far the most difficult role in the film to play but she carries it off like a true professional  i cannot believe she wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. But at the end of the day this film is the most depressing and disturbing film i have ever seen and i am almost certain i will not be watching it ever again. I'm sure you won't want to watch it after you've seen it as well. 9 stars out of 10 stars\tWow. This movie totally blew me away. I have to say it has been one of the most brutal  shocking yet refreshing films I have ever viewed. The film partly revolves around the life of Sara Goldfarb  a TV junkie who loves chocolate  who lives alone in her apartment. We witness various events in her life  such as how her son Harry steals her television set from her to pawn it for drug money  how much she loves her T.V. shows (JUICE) and her sugary junk foods  and how she really is a vulnerable  depressed and lonely woman. After winning an opportunity to appear on a television show  she posts her application form and then chooses a stunning red dress which she wore to Harry's graduation as the outfit which she will wear on television. Being a little overweight  the dress does not quite fit  so  determined to be able to wear the dress in time for her T.V. appearance  Sara decides to go on a diet. An eggs and grapefruit diet. The experience is gruelling for her  and we see how over the weeks she struggles over the temptation to indulge in doughnuts and chocolates. However when Sara's refrigerator starts jumping around and scaring her to death  she decides to do something. She decides to go to a doctor and start taking diet pills. Four pills which will be her meals for the day. Taking them seems not so bad at first. But what we discover over the days and weeks is that these pills are bad drugs. Drugs that are slowly ruining her life. It starts to come to the point of terrifying  when her fridge becomes alive and even more crazy as she starts to hallucinate. So she goes to the doctor. But the doctor doesn't seem to be interested in these weird events in the slightest  and instructs her to continue taking them. Still waiting for a reply from the T.V. studio  Sara takes the train to the studio. This scene really captures how these pills have affected her. She has changed from a moderately happy woman with good health to an unhappy  unhealthy  untidy  unstable  lonely and depressed lady  who only wants to star on television. After the studio calls the hospital  Sara is taken into care and is forced to eat some proper food in order for her to regain health and proper weight. In the end the doctors decide to treat her with ETC. At the very end of the film we can see how much Sara has been affected. The story of Sara Goldafrb is an unsettling and heartbreaking one ... the simple idea of how these pills ... these drugs have made this poor  vulnerable old woman's life spiral downward  making her a shaky  nervous lady  obsessed with her T.V. appearance. I was so sad by the end  crying to myself as my sympathy and sorrow for the character poured out of my heart  as I realised how devastating and upsetting her life turned out  after all of the terrible events. I was amazed by the absolutely stunning performance by Ellen Burstyn. It was truly dazzling and totally believable. I was affected greatly by the acting and the character in both a good and bad way. The film revolves around Sara Goldfarb's son  best friend and girlfriend too - Harry  Tyrone and Marion - three characters who deal and do drugs. The film follows them  and what they do in order to get drugs - for example  taking a trip to the supermarket. Marion  Harry's girlfriend (played by the beautiful Jennifer Connelly) is a drug addict who sleeps with a couple of men to get money  but whose talent is sketching. When Harry decides to save up enough cash in order to buy a place so Marion can set up a store  it seems nothing will go wrong. But after Tyrone gets put in jail  Harry uses all the saved money to bail him out. When failing to find any drugs to buy  Harry and Tyrone go to California - or was that Florida (!) in order to buy. In the meanwhile we also see how Marion has degraded herself to stripping in front of crowds of men  using a dildo with another woman. It concludes with Harry being taken to hospital  after we see how injecting drugs has turned Harry's arm into a horrible sight... Tyrone is taken to jail and Marion loses all dignity. We witness the various drug-related outcomes in their lives. Marlon Wayans  Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly ALL play amazingly well roles  with excellent  convincing performances. The stylish use of the split-screen technique  huge close-ups and exaggerated sound effects add to the glossiness and the soundtrack is haunting and unforgettable. I highly recommend this daring  brutal shock-fest for all of those with a strong stomach in search of a powerful and unnerving trip into the narcotics dependent darkness of modern America. A must-see ... cinematic history...\tduring the duration of this film I had to pause it 10 times simply for the fact that I felt that I was going insane. This is hands down the most disturbing and depressing movie i've ever seen. But in a very beautiful and poetic way. Pain can be beautiful because it is human. I absolutely appreciated the non compromising attitude this director took with this movie  it never lets up  never lets you breathe  holds you under water and injects pain into your veins. If you watch this movie you will be affected. Unless you are seriously out of touch with artistic forms of expression. I appreciated how it affected me  I loved how sad it made me  because it was real  that was the story  it was sad  If they had all ended up on a beach in Jamaica at the end I would have felt cheated. I kept turning away  squirming in my seat  holding my hands over my mouth and biting my lip. At the end tears came  a constant flow of them  I felt so lost so depressed so pitiful for those characters. It was just brutally honest. This is what film is for  it is not a cheap  sensationalistic piece of crap that is usually used to bring forth emotion in people. It is completely and totally honest. And If you are fragile emotionally do not watch this film. Although to be honest  I am very fragile  I watched it alone and I found it made me stronger.On a final note I'd like to add that Ellen Burstyn not winning the Oscar is one of the biggest travesties of modern film. She played this character so brilliantly I had my jaw dropped any time she spoke  during one scene she rips your heart out about five times and beats it against the ground. She is so broken so torn. It was absolutely magnificent. I wish I could tell her that she deserved that Oscar more than that sappy sell out piece of crap that won instead.anyway it made me completely uncomfortable and broken but I will appreciate that and adore this movie for the rest of my life  it is truly a beautiful film even for a girl who's favorite movie is Monty Python and the holy grail.\tI actually went to the video store expecting to come out with a copy of SPUN  but it was hired out so the attendant suggested i should give this movie a try. I got home angry about my choice. But when I started to watch this movie I was like \""what the hell is going on\"" but as you watch it  it stabs you in the heart and leaves you wanting more. Just like the many drugs used in this movie REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is addictive. But for some strange reason this movie relates a lot to so many of my friends  constantly in the drug scene. So I guess if you don't know anything about drugs to begin with  you will get a massive shock. Because this is the utter truth. But it makes me really sad because  well I wont give away any plot lines but it just tears you inside to see these people wrecking themselves and how horrible and scary their lives become. Plus my heart races even more when you realize that not only do these for people have to go through so much trauma but these kind of things happen to so many people everyday. This movie had me on the edge of my seat wanting more of this shocking truth. so bring it on.\tThis will likely be the most modest review you'll read of this film in the first few pages of a sea of 10s. I nonetheless  am convinced a 7 is the highest the film deserves. Aronofsky creates a unique film about the horrors of four characters spiraling into a chaotic conclusion due drug addiction. However  his reliance on creating an extreme  hyperbolic film undermines the movie's appeal. The film seems to be an example of pushing the boundaries simply for the sake of pushing boundaries  as no real message. It would be similar to calling a horror movie a 'classic' because the director showed a bloody decapitation after bloody decapitation or a romance movie being considered a 'classic' because it has 1/2 hour of real sex. Nonsense. The best films are the ones that leave the gory or gruesome details to the imagination yet leave you with an extraordinary impact and a message. I really got no message from the film which is heavily focused on torturing four miserable characters again and again....and again and again. What's the point? The four main actors in the film are phenomenal. Marlon Wayans surprisingly gives a stunning break out performance for someone known for starring trivial and mediocre pop culture comedies. He may have given the best or second best performance of the four. Jennifer Connelly gives a credible performance as a desperate and loyal girlfriend forced to do unthinkable sex acts. The actors strengths are their modesty and ability to succumb themselves to the most demeaning things possible.The music of the film is memorable. The film has one main theme song  but it is the most memorable and haunting theme song ever I've ever heard. I downloaded it immediately after the film. The music emphasized the tone of the film.The major weakness of the film  despite the great acting  are the characters. There's no bones about it  the characters are pure idiots. The fact that they're idiots leaves me little ability to sympathize with them  and I was trying my hardest. Furthermore  despite other reviewers efforts to paint them as \""tragic heroes\""  the main characters are not heroes in any form. It's even a stretch to suggest that they're good people. For instance  Connelly's character initially seduces an older man simply to get money. Leto's character upsets his mother repeatedly by selling her television set. Yes  they all do this to subdue their addiction.. but the term hero cannot be thrown around aimlessly. They're simply dubious protagonists. Yeah  they try to aim to get out of the drug culture and start prosperous lives. The characters have great chemistry with each other  they are somewhat slightly charismatic  but they don't do anything remotely generous or pious in the film to warrant praise as \""tragic heroes.\"" You can watch this film and immediately see the end coming. Part of you naively and helplessly hopes the film takes a sudden right turn into brighter pastures  but that is simply not the case. Aronofonsky might tease you in the beginning  but he brings you to the most overly dramatic conclusion like a car crashing into a brick wall. Ironically  while many critics bashed 'The Passion' for overemphasizing torture and maiming of Christ again and again and again and again over other aspects of Christ (and rightly so  that film has its flaws as well)  it surprising these critics praise similar methods of repetitive \""how can it get any worse\"" torture done to rather shady characters nonstop.I'm not saying this film needed a happy ending to be a good movie. But if it has a tragic ending  it should have a message. If it's just \""don't do drugs\""  than that's a grave disappointment and waste of time for a supposedly deep experimental film.To his credit  the director utilizes a neat and impressive artistic style known as \""hip hop montage.\"" The surreal spinning directing was a doozy but a great asset to the film.This film I guess is worth a watch once. But once is only time I've seen it  and I'll never sit through that film all the way through again. Period. I'm pretty confident in saying that most of those \""10s\"" people have only seen it once and will make an excuse not to see it again. The only people who will see this film again are overly depressed and eccentric  pessimistic types.... A classic has to be more than a overly nihilistic novelty act.\tFirst  I have to say that I never felt a movie hurt me before. It slapped me in the face  punched me on the kidneys  kicked me in the bowels. But I think it's the director's systematical work for the movie made me the way I felt.No sense in explaining or summarizing the film. I want to write about the system. Aronofsky has instituted a rare system for his movie that makes it run on itself. The sequences for certain drugs  the sequences for drinking coffee  turning on the TV  split screens and all details build up a skeleton for the film. The story then finds its space to fit in. It's excellent work. It's like Edgar Allan Poe's masterpiece  Raven... Mathematically perfect  calculated with absolute attention  Darren Aronofsky's film is like a poem you can write in two years. The perfectness of the piece squeezes your heart and mind bit by bit until the end of the movie.Will I watch it again? I'll say  of course. Don't you listen to a song you like a million times even it's depressing or whatever?..\tThis film is flawless. A simple idea executed perfectly. Without subtlety  this is a truly intoxicating experience. The characters experience a transition from mundane  but happy lives to living nightmares  where death seems to be a better option. Drug addiction is a common theme in films but this film is limitless in the scope of the issue. From young people needing cash to the lonely and elderly. Their lives change in a way I could never imagine.Inovation is also prominent  with split screens used in tight rations  camera-work to increase the intensity of a certain scene  whether violent or serene. Music is important and the musical score here is catchy and emotive  perfectly suited for this film. The acting is also amazing. This film  unlike others of its time does not rely on visual effects  but the skill of the cast and crew which makes this film a work of pure genius.\tI had heard so many wonderful (and controversial) things about Darren Aronofsky's REQUEIM FOR A DREAM. How sexually explicit and graphic the drug use was in this film  how the MPAA would not release this with an R rating and all that nonsense. Unfortunately  I was overseas when this movie came out so I never got a chance to see it. Luckily  I recently rented it and was absolutely stunned. This is simply put the best film I have ever seen. I thought the acting was magnificent  the situations realistic  and it truly shows what happens when drug use takes over every aspect of your life. Having lost countless friends to drugs  I can truly appreciate the nature of what these characters had to go through and I am thankful that the director chose to shoot it realistically and not stylistically. I just wish they would show this movie in schools.\tThis movie is so well-done from the beginning up to the end. Darren Aronofsky does a great job in this movie. The acting from Ellen Burstyn simply is brilliant  and should of won the Academy Award for best actress. Her character like the other three main characters(Jared Leto Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans) have a very hard life that just keeps getting harder. Marlon Wayans brings some comedy into the film  but very little. THE MOVIE IS DEPRESSING. No doubt about that so if you are looking for a laugh don't watch this one. Still the movie does an excellent job in every aspect. I won't say how the plot is because i hate ruining movies but it is very engaging.Bottom line i recommend this movie to everyone and give it 10/10 which i don't do very often. so that means go and see it.Peace\ti've seen this movie after many of my friends told me about it  so i was a little prepared..it wasn't enough! I've heartily appreciated it  it has a very straight point of view of our lifestyle odds. no way out from pessimism and reality seems to be the worst of all your nightmares..cool! i can say it's a masterpiece of underground culture. after all the laughs watching Trainspotting now comes something serious about drugs alienation. i've really enjoyed the parallelism between f**king-brains television and drugs. maybe the director's message could be a bit more widespread if the film was less brutal  but that's the film! if it wasn't so shaped it wouldn't be so damn cool! Enjoy it!"""
Sahara (2005),"I went to see this movie about a week ago in the theater and am going again today to see it. Steve Zahn is so funny in this movie i was cracking up from beginning to end. I loved it. The movie had a wonderful story line and a lot of action to. The other thing i loved about it was that it didn't have hardly any bad language in it at all. So all in all it was a really clean  funny  and action packed film that was wonderful to watch. I would say it was as about as good as national treasure...which also was a fabulous movie as well. They both had good action and comedy in them. So for a movie that will give you tons of laughs and good acting  go see \Sahara\"".\tIt had been proposed by some that the only reason Eisner Jr. (Breck) was allowed to make this film was his relationship with Eisner Sr. (Michael). While there is no proof for such an argument either way  Breck has proved to be not much worse than other directors. In fact he did better than most and worse than some. Sahara is best described as a typical entertaining adventure in the vein of Indiana Jones or perhaps National Treasure. It has a tough good guy (McConaughey)  a funny sidekick (Zane) and admirable eye-candy (Cruz). Now I admit that most things are quite shallow  but if you mix all of the above mentioned ingredients with a decent story  good action sequences and throw in the fact that there isn't one nanosecond of corniness in this movie  you inevitably end up with a crowd pleasing blockbuster.7 25 out of 10\tI really enjoyed this movie.Its an old fashioned blend of swashbuckling adventure in which men are men and women are chicks.Obviously different to the book that inspired it SAHARA is humorous and action packed.Matthew McConaughey- not normally an actor I have the slightest faith in-is surprisingly effective as the treasure seeking rogue with an eye for the ladies.Steve Zahn is a fine foil as sidekick Al Giordano ( admittedly completely miscast if you want the character from the novels  but he has a strong chemistry with McConaughey that really works on screen).William H Macy is a decent Sandecker.Only poor Penelope Cruz is underused as Dr Eva Rojas..although thankfully she is given practical wardrobe rather than the usual miniscule tat action heroines wear.The action sequences are diverting  the score is memorable but the main thing about this production is the wonderfully evocative cinematography.It seems there has been a hate campaign against this movie- no doubt from fans of Cussler's work.I liked the books too but they were at least as full as silliness and illogical plotting as the movie.Trust me.This is worth a watch.\tWonder why only movies with really heavy star cast are able to do well as far as this genre is concerned. Just the name of Harrison Ford would have been able to secure a rating of 8+ for this movie  which unfortunately is not the case. Its a nice and unpredictable movie needing viewer's constant attention. The pace is good. Is refreshing not to see any stereotyped cast. The heroics are evenly shared by the three main protagonists  which is also a welcome change. The action scenes are not so clich\u00e9d  so one can enjoy them. The movie did not try to establish any chemistry between the male and female lead and seems justifiable looking at the pace of the flick. Overall  the movie impresses.\tI would like to warn those people who did not see this 'film' yet: don't waste your time and money. Matthew McConaughey (with his irritating dialect)is simply unable to be a good actor. The only reason for his presence in the movie is that he is considered to be handsome or what. Yet  there is one good thing in this film: the director could choose a good partner for M.M.: Penelope Cruz. She is just as untalented as M.M.  therefore they make a really good couple in the movie. I've never heard about Breck Eisner who directed this 'film'  but I am quite sure that I'll never hear about him again. Some scenes contained somethings that (I guess) the makers of this movie found humorous  but no one laughed in the cinema  so I think that I was not the only one who did not get these 'funny things'. A suggestion: Please Mr. M.M. visit a speech therapist. Thank you!\tI must confess that I have never heard of Dirk Pitt before seeing this movie and am therefore unable to make comparisons to the book.However I would certainly get Sahara on DVD and recommend anyone who hasn't seen it to do so.Its a terrific action movie which for once doesn't belittle female viewers.Penny Cruz is resourceful and brave as the Doctor trying to track down a plague in Africa and doesn't just stand around waiting to be rescued.What a refreshing change for Hollywood!Matthew McConaughey makes a sexy and charismatic action hero and has a great foil in Steve Zann as his wisecracking sidekick.There are some fantastic and original action pieces great locations ( the Solar Plant looks amazing! was it made especially for this movie?) and a breakneck pace which allows one to skip over the implausibility in several places.Apparently one of the writers is sueing because of \"" changes to his plot\"".Diddums! what may or may not work in a book probably won't work in a film.The only effect this has had on me is that I definitely won't bother to read the book..although they are not aimed at women anyway.I can't see how anyone could not love this movie and eagerly await the next one...\tWhen I first saw adverts on the telly for Sahara I thought \""action adventure bang bang boom flick  interesting but not enough so to pay $10\"". Last week I discovered that it was the film adaptation of one of my favourite Clive Cussler novels! I just *HAD* to see it on the big screen. The only place it was playing in Texas was at a dollar theatre in San Antonio  so off I go  5 hours & 300 miles round trip. $1.50 a ticket. I read the reviewer who pointed out it was matin\u00e9e-ish  with set pieces each building on the other & bigger than the last. Perhaps this is one of the small things I found uncomfortable about the film. Being a fan of the novels  I feel Mr. Cussler tends to use a steady undercurrent of tension  like an undertow at the beach  with an ending like a riptide. I can only imagine the herculean efforts Mr. Cussler had to make to keep things in hand & maintain a decent semblance of his story. Strengths: Dirk is well cast & played by Matthew McConaughey. The basic plot is intact. The action is pretty good (still relies on the big bang boom tho'). WH Macy makes for a good Adm. Sandecker. THE CAR IS IN IT! The climax is pure Cussler/Pitt. Surprisingly  the soundtrack of 70's American Rock works well. A bit startling at first  it took a bit of mulling over & the decision finally came to rest on the positive side. Weaknesses: Several minor details were changed for no beneficial reason; Dirk & Al are now former USN SeALs instead of Air Force pilots. Sandecker's beard is a full-face feature rather than a Van Dyke. Rudi Gunn is no longer a former SeAL  & is a chunky comic relief character. Borderline weaknesses (aka things that are different but turned out alright none the less) Al isn't a stocky swarthy Italian powerhouse. Well played by Steve Zahn  he's got just the right touch of sarcasm & mischief. I really thought he was closer to getting his character right than McConaughey  who was quite agreeable still the same. NUMA is a private endeavour much like it's real life counterpart  which actually sets up the tidy denouement. **SPOILER WARNING** I've said in other reviews that the attention span & bladder capacity of the average viewer are too limited to do faithful translations of novels to films. A few notable exceptions are Gettysburg  North & South  The Stand & Lonesome Dove. Budgetary constraints also preclude a cast of thousands & big battle sequences. Ergo  the abduction of President Lincoln is not included in the script. Hala Kamil never makes an appearance. Without the Secretary General of the UN  & without Sandecker as the head of a US governmental agency to call in favours & pull strings  there's no timely intervention by the UN quick reaction force  therefore no heroic stand at the Foreign Legion fort. In their place  the local Tuaregs make a timely appearance to save our heroes collective bacon. There is a terrific last stand by Dirk  Al & Eva at the CSS Texas tho'  which leads to a great alternate ending which could just as easily have been in the novel! I take exception to the presentation of light machine gun armour piercing bullets being capable of penetrating the ironclad's armour  but this is fiction after all. Sadly  Prospector Clive Cussler & Periwinkle the burro  St. Julien Perlmutter & Hiram Yeager never make appearances. Conclusion: After a disagreeable experience 25 years ago with \""Raise the Titanic!\"" Clive Cussler has permitted Hollywood to take another crack at his marvelous creation. This is an acceptable first outing & hopefully the lessons learned will be taken seriously & the mild troubles rectified. I don't know what other films might be in the works  but I read that there were 3 novels optioned (take that for what it's worth). Personally  I'd love to see \""Vixen 03\"" & \""Night Probe!\"" as films  but those are my personal favourites & Hollywood can't go wrong with any of the Dirk Pitt adventures. Which is not to say Hollywood can't MAKE it wrong. Very  very wrong. I still scratch my head trying to figure out how \""Raise the Titanic!\"" turned out so modestly mildly mediocre. With such a great story  with such a capable cast  (albeit occasionally mis-cast) it should have been much better. Sahara banishes that demon  but doesn't blow it away. I recommend this as a rental for everybody  a purchase for fans  & I eagerly await the next installment. But I'll still see it at the dollar theatre.\t...at this Eisner fellow  and is totally justified for suing this production. It is just a collection of nice scenes. Really  nothing more. Not even the slightest attempt to produce a coherent plot. I haven't read any of Custler's books  but I imagine (I did see some of his documentary's) that there should be some story to it (Even without Custler's talents: It is a book: there has to be a Story!)Oke  the actors give their best try. It is not their fault. They are the only reason this movie doesn't go towards -1. Some scenes are watchable. But put it together (aka view it as a MOVIE) it just stumps my mind how anyone can let this slip past basic auditing. I've said some things about 'Mr and Mrs Smith'  but in the end that movie was watchable. This one just grinned a few millimeters of my teeth. I won't give any spoilers (...ahum...)  but Pokemon was more believable...Really  I have nothing against movies stretching the imagination of what is possible. I don't really know why this one really annoyed me. I love all sorts of adventure / science-fiction. I guess it just tries too hard to convince the viewer the events all plausible. Too bad it only had really dumb people as the audience in mind...\tMcConaughey  a courageous treasure hunter  search an ironclad from the Civil War that who knows how is in the middle of Sahara  Cruz  a courageous WHO agent  instead have to go nearby to find the source of a plague  and for both the enemies are the same. Even if it's an Indiana Jones kind of movie with a more childish script  I can't say this is a bad product. First of all people can know more about an almost unknown country as Mali (even if now is a democracy and the picture shows us as a dictatorship)  secondly it shows Africa as an energetic continent but forgotten by the World and lastly it's an environmental and not shallow movie all insert in a package of an action pop corn Hollywood movie. Certainly Indiana Jones its far superior but this is not rubbish and the characters are sympathetic specially the Admiral with an always great W.H.Macy. However I think the chemistry between McConaughey and Cruz started after the shooting because in the movie shines for his absence  but finally Cruz has a good excuse for her dreadful accent.\tthis movie is nothing but a ride that you go on in a theme park has all the thrills but not worth the money spent on it. the movie uses Indiana Jones style of story play with some BS acting. The main character never seems to get the viewers into the movie. He is too busy with his treasure hunt he doesn't care about what happens to him or his pals. and his sidekick buddy is very annoying with his lame acting and grade 1 words to go with it. and the very last the caring doctor who is retarded just never seems to know what she is doing... horrible horrible movie.... the movie has some good action and a mindless story to go with it. if there are people who are mindless enough to waste their money on the DVD have to be pretty dumb and even renting this movie is a crime. i recommend donating your money to the Salvation Army instead at least it will help the African people unlike the movie.Please don't waste your money.\t\""Sahara\"" so strained my credulity that I feared it would snap and give me whiplash. The strain started with the name of the hero: Dirk Pitt. Now there's a manly name. I found myself coming up with even more outrageous names  ala \""Mystery Science Theater.\"" How about \""Rock Hardin\""? \""Harry McChest\""? \""Punch Meatslab\""? \""Buck Bronzeback\""? \""Dick Steele\"" was already taken.The plot is basically part Steve Sommers's \""The Mummy \"" mixed with a touch of Indiana Jones and a pinch of James Bond. Dirk and his sidekick Al (why not a better sidekick name  like \""Buzz\"" or \""Fuzzy\""?) are on a quest to find a lost Confederate ironclad battleship  which managed to make its way across the Atlantic and up an African river  only to be buried in the treacherous sands of the Sahara. Never mind that you don't have to be a ship designer to know that such a vessel would have less chance of making it across the Atlantic than a rubber ducky. Never mind that this fact is pointed out to Dirk more than once by other characters. You're just supposed to go with it.Such movies need to have a sense of giddy fun about them  like Sommers's \""Mummy.\"" Much of the fun is stripped out with a parallel quest involving Penelope Cruz as a World Health Organization doctor trying to track down the source of a contagion that's spreading from the country of Mali and into Nigeria. I don't know about you  but juxtaposing the story of two treasure-hunting frat boys with that of a doctor trying to stop the spread of a contagion that threatens the lives of thousands of people kind of bled some of the fun away for me.There's also a warlord so mean that he  well  \""put the 'war' back in 'warlord.'\"" (I wonder where the war went?) He's hell bent on covering up the contagion  taking bribes from a big corporation that's using his country as a toxic waste dump (the source of the contagion  which is conveniently located near the buried battleship)  and fighting a group of ragtag warlord wannabes. Oh  and this contagion  if it reaches the ocean  will cause a worldwide environmental disaster. With me so far?Dirk and Al cheerfully wisecrack their way across Mali as they blow up their boss's speedboat  bounce along on camels  dodge bullets  save the doc  and wreak havoc at a high-tech installation that would be right at home in a James Bond flick. Clues drop in their laps like manna from heaven. My favorite is a cave painting that tells them everything they need to know. With hints like these  the Three Stooges could find this battleship. (In fact  this would've been a great vehicle for Moe  Larry  and Curly.)\tI think that I was like a lot of people who assumed that this movie was just going to be a spin off of National Treasure. I never really wanted to see it  but my little brother dragged me to it. Actually  I think that it was just a mistake about releasing it so soon to when they had released National Treasure. It gave people too much time to see National Treasure and assume that it was going to be identical. Don't get me wrong  I loved National Treasure  but this movie was really good too. There were lots of big explosions and fast paced chases. The locations the movie was shot in was beautiful  there were some great dessert shots. I really liked the plot of the movie  it did seem a little like Indiana Jones and National Treasure  but all Action/Adventure movies tend to follow a lot of the same lines. Matthew McConaughey and Steve Zahn made a great team and I hope to see them do another movie together  and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz is an amazing actress. Overall  I think that everyone should go out and rent it  it's just a fun movie to watch.\tSAHARA is one of those films to view when escapism is the goal of the evening. Made along the same lines as the 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' genre  mixing adventure with comedy  a smattering of love interest  a dollop of social comment  and some pretty fine scenery that creates a stage for likable actors such as Matthew McConaughey  Steve Zahn  Penelope Cruz  William H. Macy  Delroy Lindo  and Lambert Wilson  SAHARA succeeds in pulling off an interesting caper film.Not having read the apparently sacrosanct novel by Clive Cussler upon which the film is based  this 2 hour plus film seemed to putt along without any great shakes  without much in the way of character development  without any hint of screen chemistry between Cruz and McConaughey  but with the surprise pleasure of watching Steve Zahn steal the scenes with his comic talent. It is that kind of film - not to be taken seriously or valued higher than its intent. It is just entertainment - and there is nothing wrong with that! Grady Harp\twell if you want all the elements of a good popcorn movie  this has it.Matthew  looking as tanned and attractive as always (my partners comment) and Penelope and Stevy giving admirable support.Good fun  well paced  with some great stunts  and very funny partnership of McConaughey and Zahn. William H Macy  who is just  as always  class.A simple plot  or so it seems  swerves a bit and does not fully explain how the boat got into the desert from America  but who cares about details like thatJust enjoy the spectacle  a small human story a subtle romance  and rollicking good rideEnjoyed it  bought it on DVD.if you like it comment  if you didn't don't be too negative\tI just finished Sahara and boy am I glad I didn't let poor reviews dissuade me from this film. Sahara was an absolute joy from beginning to end. For me  the action  adventure  and lightheartedness of Sahara immediately brought back found memory of the Indiana Jones trilogy. It has been quite a while since I've seen an action movie with imagination and adventure that managed not to take itself too seriously. And that  I believe  is the key to Sahara! By avoiding the drama and seriousness exhibited by so many recent action flicks it endears itself to the viewer and makes unbelievable characters and situations much more palatable. I would suggest Sahara to anyone looking for a fun movie that will take them on a action-packed adventure with a few good laughs along the way.\tHaving watched SAHARA on DVD today  I was sadly disappointed. The plot jogs along at a fair pace and is all great fun  but there are times when the fact that several critical plot elements from the book have been deleted from the UK version makes the film very weak and more superficial than it needs. The appearance of an old aeroplane in the middle of the desert just when our heroes need transport  with no explanation  combined with the missing links to President Lincoln from the original excellent Clive Cussler story  appear to have been missed or saved for the US version (What is that all about-give UK viewers a break !) The actors try their best with the subsequently disjointed plot  but although it was a good film  it could have been great  with just a few minutes extra by way of explanation. Don't miss it - it is a good laugh  but make sure you read the book afterwards.\tAs a Cussler fan I left wishing I had not read the book before seeing the film! Although the basics of the tale were there it was so mashed about so as not to be funny. There were things that never took place and parts that should have been there that were totally missing or altered beyond all recognition. Neither Dirk or Al looked much like depicted in the books  however Sandecker was close if a little thin.Taking the fact that I had read the book out it was a passable effort at an action adventure  which was much better than the only previous try at one of Clives books - Raise the Titanic (1980) which prompted him to say never would another film be made of his books  this time sadly he will mean it! A great shame as the characters have great potential.The humour that was there did make me smile and the action was reasonable for what it was.\tAs a big Clive Cussler fan  I was greatly looking forward to seeing this film - especially in the light of how badly \""Raise The Titanic\"" has fared in its film version. \""Sahara\"" was full of promise.Unfortunately  the film-makers have overlooked everything that was great about the book  and we're left with another run-of-the-mill adventure film.Where was the epic trek across the desert  full of hardship and thirst? That is *the* essence of the book: how Dirk and Al endured one of nature's toughest tests. The film makes their journey seem like a stroll along a California beach  albeit with a large sand dune or two.Where was the plot about Massarde and Kazim keeping prisoners in inhuman conditions and using them as slave labour? The film shows one scene that tells us some of Kazim's enemy soldiers had been captured. Sorry  but that's not the same. The reason the bad guys are SO evil in the book is because the book shows you what they're capable of. The film merely portrays them as a kindergarten criminal and dictator.Where was the climax  where Massarde got his comeuppance? The ending of the film is tame to say the least.The biggest disappointment  however  was that none of the major characters were remotely like Cussler's original creations. Pitt in the film is a surfer dude; Cussler's original character has a lot more depth and sophistication. Giordino is supposed to be a stocky  curly-haired Italian with a deadpan sense of humour. None of these elements are present in the film Giordino! Sandecker is supposed to play hardball. Cussler's Sandecker would never have accepted being brushed off by the government official as he was in the film.Is it right for me to judge the film based upon my expectations from Clive Cussler's characters and his novel? Yes  I think this is perfectly fair. It's supposed to be a film based upon the book. While I accept that a regular-length film will never be able to contain all the plot and depth of a thick novel  it should at least take a stab at including all the most important elements. All of these are missing in the film.A word of advice to those fans of Clive Cussler: don't expect too much.\tA sequel to Raise the Titanic this was being billed as  excuse me while I have a quick belly laugh! Adapapted from one of Clive Cussler's popular Dirk Pitt series of novels  this very much Holywoodised adaptation is glossy  well photographed and very slick.Whilst most entertainment these days can be enjoyed by leaving your brain at the door on the way in  for this  it would be wise not to bring you brain anywhere near the door in the first place as the plot leaves a lot to be desired with holes the size of battleship in it.The original plot line about the highly unlikely story (or plot device  take your pick) of the lost Civil War Ironclad battleship winding up on the wrong side of the Atlantic in the middle of a desert is seemingly forgotten for the middle two thirds of the film until an urgent requirement for something with armour plating and a convenient working cannon turns up.Whilst there are good laughs to be had and the casting of the criminally underused Willam H Macy as Admiral Sandecker is spot on  there are other problems  not the least of which is the civil war in Mali that seems to be lacking somewhat. More so as the supposed War Lord is as weak as a dishcloth and has a very small army who surrender in a split second the moment the native rebels turn up on horseback and en-masse.The biggest failing though is the woefull miscasting of Matthew McConaughey as Dirk Pitt. If Pitt is supposed to be a long experienced old sea dog then he should at least appear older  wiser and less barmy than this  more like Dirk Pitt was portrayed in the dreadful adaptation of Raise the Titanic twenty five years or more earlier.Overall  its watchable  the special effect are impressive but it is very silly. As this looks like the beginning of a franchise  I hope that they learn from the mistakes made here and consider recasting the Pitt role to someone more mature.\tthis movie was the best movie I've ever seen. It held my attention. There was action  there was adventure  there were speedy boats  there were actors and actresses. I thought it was grand. They hunted for treasure while saving ladies  and also ended up doing a good turn for their country. When they did this  they also did a not-so-good turn for the bad guys. All in all  this movie was OK. Maybe not as good as some other movies I've seen  but what can you ask for in this day in age? Certainly not the sort of wonderful plots  acting  scenery  artistic awareness  etc. of the movies of yore  but this is definitely something you could waste $10 or more on. Depends if you have a date or not."""
Saw (2004),"i used to be a big fan of the cube really wonderful film.last week i talked with a friend and he said saw was even better that the previous film .i doubted in his words i remember when i was looking through the cinema's program and i read the description two chained men and between them a dead body and each one has to kill the other in 3 hours.American idotism i thought but i was wrong.returning back to that time i'm grateful i didn't watch it i wasn't prepared for it.but then i realized i would give the movie a chance.i borrowed the cassette and started watching it.i bared only the first 15 minutes.it was like a shock for my mind and my mentality.i stopped the film and in the next few hours was thinking only about it.after i dared to watch the rest of it i went out to see my boyfriend i was standing in the metro and i was watching the throng there thinking \oh my god do they reslise they are alive?\""because that's what jigsaw wanted to make his victims feel and he's right-man ignores it\tThis movie would have to be my all time favorite movie. I love horror movies and this is definitely a horror movie. This movie also kept my suspense up  and I had no idea who the killer was until the end. The movie kept me guessing and wondering  which I love. I was definitely surprised at the end of the movie. I love the characters in the movie. They were excellent at keeping me scared. After the first time I saw this movie  I just wanted to keep watching because I love this movie so much. Each time I watched I was shocked all over again.Everyone definitely needs to see this movie! I cant wait to see if there will be a Saw2!\tI heard a lot of people say this movie is comparable to Seven. Are you kidding ???This silly little thriller has nothing to do with David Fincher's masterpiece. For several reasons.First  Seven is able to catch the audience attention and to thrill them without needing to use some childish trick like a masked villain coming suddenly out of darkness!Second  Seven carries on a deep psychological analysis on the main characters. Saw doesn't even try to do so (not bad for an alleged \""psychological thriller\"" !!!)Third there's an enormous difference in the quality of the actors' performances between the two movies! We have Brad Pitt  Morgan Freeman  Kevin Spacey end Gwyneth Paltrow versus Danny Glover and the guy from \""Robin Hood: Man in Tights\"" !!!Fourth the quality of direction  photography and cutting aren't even comparable.Fifth  Seven is completely believable  while Saw is full of nearly ridiculous logically impossible situations  and many things in the plot just don't work! (e.g.: a doctor not realizing the man lying next to him is not dead  the obsessed detective who lets the jigsaw run away once he got him  the X on the wall not seen by the two prisoners at the beginning  when the lights are off  and many other things)Just to mention the most evident reasons.I rented this movie because everybody said to me it was like Seven. And I am so mad at throwing away my money this way!!\tA friend of mine used to play a fiendish little parlor game  which went something like this: \""Three men have machine guns trained on your parents. They will kill them unless you cut off your left foot with a chainsaw. Do this  and they will not only spare your lives  but also give you one million dollars. Would you do it?\"" This is the premise of Saw  another in a long line of movies about cunning psychos who have unlimited time and resources. In this entry  the fiendish \""Jigsaw\"" places people in seemingly hopeless situations  just to see what they would do to live a little longer\u0097and to make them appreciate living a little more. For example  a would-be suicide  who had once tried slitting his wrists  is forced to crawl naked through a lethal maze of razor wire. A young female drug addict is forced to cut into a man's stomach to pull out the key to a nasty bear-trap-like device strapped to her head  according to directions given her on video by a talking clown dummy on a tricycle.Yes  Jigsaw is quite the tinkerer. He's Rube Goldberg channeling the Marquis de Sade after watching a fistful of Dario Argento and David Fincher movies. Yet he really just wants to help people. He's the Dr. Phil of psychos.But the focus of the movie is two men\u0097a sleazy photographer and a doctor\u0097chained to pipes at opposite ends of what appears to be Hell's men's room. A corpse lies between them in a pool of blood  a gun in one hand and a cassette tape player in the other. Seems that Jigsaw will kill the doc's estranged wife and daughter  unless the doc kills the photographer. You're in for over a 100 minutes of head games  screaming  whimpering  whiplash editing  and enough nihilistic techno music to make Ozzy Osborne's head explode.Yes  it's every bit as entertaining as it sounds. Your interpretation of the previous sentence will reveal just what kind of a movie fan you are.I won't reveal much more  but note that these poor guys each have a hacksaw  not for cutting through their chains  but through their ankles. That's it  really\u0097the whole movie is about waiting to see some guy saw through his ankle. Oh  and there is the identity of Jigsaw  but when the revelation comes  you won't feel that you've been misdirected by a master storyteller as much as you've been rooked by a carnie.Do yourself a favor. If you really want to see a flick about a psycho who outsmarts everyone in sight  rent The Abominable Dr. Phibes and let Vincent Price show you how it's done.\tReleased in theaters nationwide on October 29  2004. I figured my dad and I would watch it just in time for Halloween. It occurred to us that this would be another entertaining thriller  living up to our expectations. 'Saw' unleashed something far more on the contrary than what we expected.Simply  it's about two men held hostage by a madman in a room with a dead body between them. They must find a way out while one of them has been given the burden to murder the other. Throughout the film  you understand what the so-called 'Jigsaw killer' has done to other people. He forces them to play lethal games of survival to appreciate life. Not many of them live to tell the tale  so you can understand how mad Jigsaw really is. Conflicts arise between the two men in the room as they struggle to stay alive and outwit their kidnapper.You find out that the storyline and the 'title character' Jigsaw are far different than ordinary thrillers. Jigsaw's killing techniques are much more unique since he does not in fact do the killings personally. If you're open minded enough  you might appreciate the effort that the producers did to film such a unique picture.Although it's entirely graphic and maybe unbearable to watch  it helps you to get an idea of how the victims in the film felt. 'Saw' put so much adrenaline into me  I couldn't believe that the filmmakers were able to pull off something like that. This horror/thriller is worth watching and sharing over and over because of its many surprises and twists. Even today  'Saw' chills my blood with fear  numbs my legs with shock  and quickens my pulse with excitement. Many audiences have criticized this movie for the many questions the film leaves behind at the end. But that's why 'Saw II' is nearly completed in production.I hope this comment was useful to some of you. I completely recommend watching it; you won't be disappointed. The ending will no doubt leave you speechless. 'Saw' helps you understand how far off the edge desperate people can be pushed to...and most of the time the solution involves shedding blood.\tThis definitely isn't one for the faint hearted. There is a very disturbing scene in this movie involving the girl from Becker  but as much as it disgusts you  try to watch the movie past that point. It's that point in the movie where it shifts from horror movie to thriller. I have to admit I saw (get it) this movie thinking it would be a bit of a stinker. I mean a one million dollar budget for a horror film made in Hollywood  usually means trouble. Damn me if it wasn't one of the best horror/thrillers I've ever seen. Take out Cary Elwes average acting and this movie is sensational. That camera flash scene is so clever I wish I had thought of it. I can understand why so many people walked out  as early on this movie is pretty horrific. However I believe the movie is worth it  and if you are one of those people always whinging about Australian movies  remember that this movie was directed  written and acted in by two very talented young Australians. Now pass me that blunt saw I have an itch to scratch.\tWatching the movie is a guilty pleasure like coming upon a car wreck  you can't turn away! It has the horror  blood and gore aspect without being cheesy. It does borrow from early slasher films with a touch here and there of the morality play (do a bad deed get punished) but even that has some unexpected twists. There was more fun in just enjoying the emotional acting than to spend the energy to identify the culprit. The mix of more well known actors like Danny Glover and Monica Potter playing secondary roles and relative unknowns in lead roles was refreshing. Any movie where I catch myself talking out loud to it and exclaiming random expletives got the reaction from my psyche I look for in a film. Worth watching and talking to others to see if you both came to the same conclusions regarding the ending. If you watch late at night be prepared to stay up after for an hour or so to clear your mind or if you enjoy nightmares go directly to sleep  we all have choices. The mind can dismiss the evil and horror of what is questionable in it's possibility of occurrence. It is much harder to see the evil that men hold in the hearts and act on and say it couldn't happen. Highly recommend to those who enjoy being taken to the edge  but watch with someone!\tThis movie was awesome. There were some parts when I was confused as to who the killer was. For instance  when Danny Glover was in his apartment across the street from the Doc's place it you saw the orderly guy in Dr. Gordon's house  so you think the orderly might be the killer  but then Glover kept saying \"" I should have never let you go\"" and staring at the pictures of Dr. Gordon; You don't really find out who the killer is til the end. From the scene where they show Dr. Gordon talking to the residents in the hospital and kept referring to the patient as \""the patient\"" and the orderly walks in and says\"" his name is John\"" I thought for sure he was the killer. The schemes on the decisions the victims were put in was very creative. The ending was the best ending I have seen in awhile. I can't believe they made this movie in only 18 days!!! You should definitely see this movie....\tSpoiler alert.I really hated this movie. And it shocks me that I am one of only a few. To me  the film was heavily influenced by several 90s thrillers and slasher films (\""Se7en\""  especially) and the story basically relied on old ideas and shock value. The violence was disgusting and often ridiculous  and I sort of feel like the people that did this movie thought they had to make it really gross to be scary.Most of the scenes seemed as though they were trying to just scare the bajeezus out of the viewer without creating any sort of suspense or fear. For example  a woman has to dig around in the stomach of her drugged-up friend so her head doesn't explode. Why?? What the hell is the point of that? It's just stupid. And in the final scene  why did the guy have to saw through his foot?! I mean  c'mon. There were ways around that. He just seemed to snap  and suddenly the fact that the key to his shackle was just a few feet away was irrelevant.Okay  I admit that the cinematography was sort of cool...But Cary Ewles? Good god. He was great in \""The Princess Bride\""  \""Robin Hood: Men in Tights\""  and as the villain in a variety of family and action films. But in \""Saw\"" he was truly awful. I think my local newspaper stated it best in a caption under a photo of Elwes in \""Saw\"": 'Mommy  please make the bad actor go away'. In conclusion  \""Saw\"" was an interesting concept that was executed horribly. But I'm probably just crazy  because everyone else in the world seems to love it.\tThis movie is my kinda movie  a little bit of action some good scary parts and a few funny parts too. The best thing about this movie was that it could actually happen although not a true story  The movie is about a sick maniac person who has a history of taunting people and capturing them  and then locking them in a room playing games with there minds. What a movie! huh see for yourself! i recommend this movie for anyone who can handle Blood and Gore... or 13 14 plus. the only setback is of course a few blood gory scenes. well please tell me if you liked what i wrote here by checking yes or no.... i would love to here your feedback.......\tTwo men  Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes)  wake up  chained on the wall  in a small room. In the middle of the room there is a dead body  holding a tape player. Men find tapes from their pockets and they soon find out  that they are in the middle of a sick game  organized by a sick serial killer. The name of the game is: Kill the other man and be free. They are also provided with two saws. You do the math. Detective Tapp (Danny Glover) tries to run against time to catch that sadistic SOB  called the Jigsaw  because of twisted games he plays with his victims.I really can't say Saw is for the most faint hearted people in the world: It's gruel  sadistic and bloody. It rolls along its sadistic rails  steadily to the end  even though the plot has some small details  which were left unpolished or unthought. Some aspects of the story are rather silly  if you start to think about them  but those things won't get in the way of the horror  no matter how illogical they seem afterward. I'd recommend this one for the horror genre fans  but I would think it twice if you are just a regular \""Scream\"" or \""I know What you Did last summer\"" type of horror watcher\tIt has a great ending  completely unpredictable. It is very twisted that someone actually thought this up  very original; commendable... or committable. It reminds me of Se7en  though not as good. Se7en has a lot more research involved  in keeping with the whole deadly sins; Kevin Spacey  Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are beyond reproached. Saw is completely original ideas  however based solidly on the concept of peoples apathy and lack of respect for their own lives. The actors here past mustard and the story is what drives the film  but being second to Se7en is still excellent. Innovated death scenarios keep you interested and prevent the usual boredom and monotony that accompany films like theses. Takes place mostly in two or three sets  but it doesn't diminish it in anyway. Cinematography reflects the mood to tee  that is deranged  twisted  psychotic  panic and primal. Anyway  very pleased  all story and no fluff.\tThis was a great movie. This was a very well written movie  better than anything that I have seen in quite some time. Never once paid any attention to the guy in the middle of the floor. As it ended  I couldn't believe that it was the \""dead\"" guy. Never once thought of him. I have to admit that I thought that it was Zip. But what I don't understand was this  Zip was the only person that was nice to the guy  making Lawrence say his name. Why would he hurt him. It also took me all movie to figure out that black cop was Danny Glover. Lots of overacting but a great movie none the less. Ending was very much like American Beauty  where you sit there and go \""Did I just see that?\""\tI usually don't go to see 'scary movies'  and I don't usually admit to really liking them. However  I must confess that \""Saw\""  though lacking in acting skills and merit  managed to hold my attention. Cary Elwes' (whom as I will always and forever know as Westley from The Princess Bride)  acting performance was weak and contributed greatly to the overall cheesiness of the movie. I will give the writer credit- it was well planned out. If you miss the last five minutes of the movie  you've missed the entire movie. An article by Jason Freeden on the Associated Content web page noted  \""It is one of those movies that leave you thinking until the end  and then boom right at the end leave you hanging\"". I have heard rumors of a sequel  but I'm not quite sure where it could lead...\tSaw is one of those movies that come along and whacks you really hard. Much like \""Halloween\"" did when I first it and the original \""Texas Chainsaw Massacre\""  \""Saw\"" ranks up there as one of the best horror movies around. The movie opens up with a guy in a bathtub (one of the films screenwriter's) chained to a large pipe (maybe a steam pipe?) he quickly realizes he is not alone as another voice calls out to turn on the lights. When the lights are turned on we see another guy (Carey Elwes) on the other side of the room chained to a large pipe as well and in between them is a dead guy. The dead guy has a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other. The plot begins. What's great about this movie is it never lets you in on what's going on  however  on second viewing  you see the clues left and right (which is a true sign of a great movie.) We quickly find out the police (Danny Glover) is looking for a notorious serial killer named \""Jigsaw\""  dubbed by the curious ways he leaves his victims. However  what's interesting  and as the police point out  is that he doesn't do the killings...or does he? Since this movie is very intricate it's hard to explain the points without giving away crucial plot/turning elements  but it's that very thing that makes this movie great. I have seen almost every horror movie out there and I'm pretty numb to most  but this movie  let me tell ya  I had dreams/nightmares about this movie days after I've seen it  trying to figure out what I would in the same situation. I must say  this movie is one good scare  just when you think it's falling into a routine  Bam! it gets you again. I highly recommend this movie if you truly want a great horror movie.\tI'm really and honestly a bit in awe of this movie's high rating on the IMDb  especially in comparison to some other  and in my opinion  better horror movies. Sorry to say it  but I think this movie sucked  all the more so because I went with somewhat high hopes and because a very good thriller could have been made from this quite inventive and interesting scenario. Before everyone starts posting a bunch of worthless insults and saying I didn't get it or I don't know horror movies  let me just lay out some of my criticisms: Within the first five minutes I was chuckling at the acting and the lines. Whannel actually faired a little better against the more veteran Elwes  who was so over-emotive and so miscast I felt a bit sorry just having to watch him  unfortunate since I've liked him in other movies. The dialogue lacked really any kind of subtlety  and while I understand the necessity to introduce the killer through flashbacks and memories of reading the newspaper  the way it was done seemed so contrived it was like watching a puppetmaster pulling strings. It's a case of show vs. tell  I think. The dialogue seemed to be grudgingly forcing the plot along inch by inch rather than letting it develop.Then we have the scenes involving the other victims: Was no one else annoyed by the sudden and jarring use of ultra fast MTV-motion and pointlessly loud music? I think these scenes would've been better played out much more slowly  wherein every second that passed becomes just that  one second closer to a horrifying death  one more ratchet of tension in which the audience could have felt the torment I'm sure the victims were. Something tells me those victims would have felt every second pass in those situations.Danny Glover's character seemed to be a very unprofessional cop. Anyone involved in any aspect of investigation would know Dr. Gordon's pen appearing at the scene  while odd  is purely circumstantial  and not reason to start an obsessive and far from legal stalking of the guy. In this kind of case a cop would have relied much more on forensic data and psychological profiling. Yeah  I guess his mind snapped a little upon seeing his partner so brutally dispatched  but... I just didn't believe this character. Likewise to the wife and daughter  who were so underdeveloped  and whose only chances at development were robbed by Dr. Gordon's disdain or at least disregard for his family that I just didn't care what happened to them in the end  nor did I believe Dr. Gordon's sudden impulse to lop off his own leg in an attempt to save them.Aside from these  there were just too many contrivances and errors along the way. How could Whannel have woken up submerged in water without having drowned? How would a medical doctor not recognize that the dead body on the floor was not dead? What did Jigsaw have against Zapp (name?)  who was the only character who was interested in or kind to him? Could Dr. Gordon really not think of a better way to get that phone? Would that cell phone really work in that buried basement  and would it work only on the plot-dictated occurrences that it did? Why were Whannel and Elwes the only victims to have a long  drawn-out  two person situation? On the plus side  I do think the initial idea is quite inventive  and  although in retrospect the ending doesn't seem to add up logically  the finale of Saw does stick in my mind as being the one part I thought was really fairly well done. The image of Jigsaw standing up  his last look at Whannel  the implied but not shown final fates of our two main characters -- this whole sequence was quite tense and a really unexpected bit of icing on the cake after my expectations for the movie had dropped so low throughout the rest of the viewing. It just seems to me that a much better movie could have been made  the situation offers ample opportunity for a strongly character driven movie  while the outside situations could provide for sequences of unbearable tension  by a more seasoned and talented director of suspense with better dialoague at his disposal and the ability to elicit better performances from less miscast actors.Tell me  am I really wrong in thinking it strange that this is the most talked about horror movie to come out in years... or has American horror just really gone so far down hill? And tell me also  what is it exactly that everyone saw in this movie that I didn't that sets it so far apart from all the other horror movies and thrillers of recent years? I really am quite curious.\""Toy-like people made me boy-like.\""\tI rented this movie for my mom to see - she is a big fan of thrillers - but  boy oh boy  she couldn't stand this one! Even though there isn't any cinematic comparison  mom said  \""This is the worst movie I've seen since Xanadu.\"" Too much dark photography  couldn't hold the interest enough... mainly due to bad acting and choppy storyline. It got on my mom's nerves the little girl continually crying  \""Mommy  help me  mommy  help me.\"" About 15 minutes before the ending  it held my mom's attention  but  the ending itself  she found totally stupid. If the story was strong enough  maybe the rest of the problems could have been minimized - but  it wasn't  so it couldn't. Enough said...\tThis movie was really excellent. Very exciting all the time and a lot good (and also shocking) scenes. Keeps you focused. You don't want to miss a second of it. Sometimes you just jump up from your seat. Or you don't dear to look anymore  but you MUST. Not a \""standard\"" horror movie with every second body parts falling off  like \""Nightmare on Elmstreet\"" or whatever more or less \""simple\"" horror movie without a real story. But a good story with a red line and some flashbacks. The conversations between the two men which are locked in the room are structured nicely  and look very natural (as far as one can say this about this sort of movie). Seems to be low-budget  but they achieved to make this movie superb. Surprising end.\tFirst I need to say I am not a real fan of this genre. I can watch horror or thriller  some of them are even quit good  especially the ones with difficult clues like this movie. But I just didn't like it. Two man in a dirty room  a dead man between them. One time during the movie the clue went through me  but soon I thought 'no  is impossible'. It shares a lot of similarities with identity  another movie of this sort. I did like Identity  maybe because there are more characters playing in it. Also some things from Se7en I recognized. I just didn't like the two characters and I didn't like the clue. I recommend this movie to everybody who loves the chainsaw- and axemovies  but for me it was just crap.\tOne of the worst films to call itself a horror movie. Come on  there is suspense of disbelief for the genre then there is complete stupidity. The plot made no sense  the \""reveal\"" was see through and expected with implausible situations (such as the how does he get the guy in the tub  do his thing then get himself into position without being wet in time for him to wake). Shotguns don't delay before they go off. Danny Glovers character was wasted. The final \""cutting\"" was for no reason. Having cancer does not make you immune to shotgun blasts in the back. I wanted my money and the time I spent wanting it back. It wasn't even bad it's funny bad  it was MY GOD MAKE IT STOP bad. God can't believe this got a sequel."""
Serenity (2005),"I went to this movie with very high expectations  and they were met and surpassed. I don't believe I have ever had such expectations and had them met like that. I left the theater drained  exhausted  exhilarated. I have never felt this way after a film. I hope its this way for the new viewer. I can't think it will be quite as draining  but I hope the emotions are roused. And people leave with something special. I know I did. This film has it all. The most believable dialog  a cast you will fall in love with. And even though it is far from a comedy  it will make you laugh out loud. Then there is the plot and action. Now folks  you do have to pay attention  but you will be rewarded if you do. This is not written for the weak at heart. If you want mindless entertainment you are in the wrong spot. Mr. Whedon proves you can have space ships  gun fights  and a plot!!! Even a message for the people and the fans. I saw the version that did not have completed special effects and it did not detract at all. Same with the soundtrack  and with the emotions that just the dialog  action and filler soundtrack brought out. Well once we have a soundtrack  it will be even unbelievable. Its not a pretty future  but there is hope  and it is believable. Joss Whedon took me out of the theater and put me on the crew of Serenity for 2 hours. I felt their fear  pain  love  shock and elation. I truly was not cognizant of my surroundings. I had one of the Stars of the film sitting about 10 feet behind me during my screening. I forgot he was there within 10 minutes. And I really planned on watching Adam Baldwin's reactions. And just to comment on the acting job of our big heroes. Well  as the fans all know it was superlative. But  if you are not familiar with the Firefly 'verse (go buy or rent the dvds!)  I feel  top honors go to Nathan Fillion  Gina Torres and Summer Glau. Again  all actors did a wonderful job  I would give Oscars to all. But those three had the meatiest material and were able to emote  without going over the top. Gina's portrayal of a Soldier woman was spot on. Nathan  brought all the anguish of the loss of the browncoats  to his future fight for survival  his care for his ship and crew and his need to do the right thing. Summer just brought a vulnerability to her character  that could have been a one note character  with a lesser actress  or script. The love of the cast for this project and each other was not just acting  it shown through and gives this film something special. If this does not get Joss Whedon and family some major scifi recognition  then I am giving up on scif!!! I know it is too much to ask the academy to accept a scifi film for best movie  or director  or script. But this is Oscar worthy material folks. Not just for Joss  but many members of the cast deserve the little statue. I would give them to all if I could. Jewel  Sean  Adam  Morena  Alan and Ron gave stellar performances  they just didn't have as much air time this time. But when we get our next movie  all bets are off. I also got to see the finished version at comic con  even better!! The soundtrack added a lot. No major changes  just some tweaks. Loved it even more.\tThe others do a good job gushing about the movie. Sure we're fans and bound to like the movie more than the usual fare  but those looking for an original and thrilling movie experience  this will shock and amaze. The Firefly world introduced a fantasy home for many of us  with characters we truly cared about and dilemmas we could get behind. The best way to describe it is to take the best aspects of the Han Solo elements of the original Star Wars  and build a world around that. There's no grand theme or clear cut good and evil. There's just a band of fugitives trying to make their way in a dangerous sky. It's something folks can relate to  although most of us won't be in a space battle or fighting psychotic creatures anytime soon. The point of the name Serenity is the name of the ship  though in a deeper sense that's what our characters are in search of. Finding freedom and a home  and that's what the ship represents to them  and to the fans. So you understand why so many are so excited about this dinky little scifi flick. The movie captures that beautiful feeling but takes us on a ride that there's no turning back from. In my opinion  the one thing that makes for a truly GREAT movie is if you walk out of the theater a different person than when you walked in. This movie takes you on such a journey I didn't know if I would leave the theater at all. Sure the visual effects are stunning  but even the unfinished effects I saw meant nothing to me because it was the characters I cared about (and note that the digitally created ship itself is one of them  and I cared just as much for that than any of them). The humor is probably better than anything in the theaters this year  and the action is even greater. My screening actually came a week after Episode 3 was released  and I immediately washed my hands of Mr Lucas  and months later when I saw Fantastic 4... well let's not even talk about that one.This movie really does have something for everyone  and even in the core of the geek fandom  the range of people is total - men and women split it at least 50/50  uber-geeks and \cool\"" types  and a surprising amount of attractive people of all ages. Seriously though  don't trust the rants of the fans. Check out the movie for yourself. Give it an honest chance and I promise you will be taken on a journey that will turn you into a fan as well.\t***NO SPOILERS*** I saw the movie at a sneak preview in Houston  TX on 6/23/05. I was just happy that we were getting more of these characters and this setting.Visually  it was stunning. The extra budget for effects was well spent. The characters and their relationships were recognizable  but there had been changes from the show. I think this was necessary within the movie  and part of an evolution from the TV show to the big screen (the movie takes place 6 months after the last episode  \""Objects in Space\""). Things have changed.There is a higher action and violence level in this (duh  it's a movie  not on TV)  and we get some major revelations about the world (which some who saw it with me already don't like). There are some MAJOR events that affect the characters  and I wasn't totally happy with them - shocked is the word. But this is Joss's world  and his characters  and he tells the stories he wants to tell. He doesn't get bound up in hurting our feelings; he just tells it like it is. I believe he did say that this was the hardest thing he'd ever had to write.At least one person at our screening was a \""Firefly virgin \"" and he said that he liked it. I hope people who have no exposure to the show will be able to see this and enjoy it. Our big damn heroes come across well  and I hope this will get them some well-deserved exposure. This is a no-holds barred  big-time action/adventure sci-fi story  bold and raw  and set in a world unlike anything portrayed in SF before (well  except for \""Firefly\""). And I hope it does really  really well  and we get to see the sequels.\tI had never even heard of the show Firefly when my friend dragged me along to the pre-screening of this film. I had no idea what to expect. All she said was that it had something to do with space cowboys and that it was sci-fi.While I watched the film  I found myself so attached to the characters that everything that happened to them actually mattered to me. Sci-fi and action movies often rely on the adventure aspect to carry it but Serenity actually had me loving the people in it. I wanted more when I got out of that theater. I was amazed by the wit and very happy with the plot (that has more than a couple twists that you won't be expecting). I was hooked and I couldn't stop thinking about it.Since then  I've watched the entire series and loved all of it  but in the end  I think Serenity leaves it in the dust.\tI found \""Serenity\"" to be the best movie I have seen in quite a while. \""Serenity\"" is the new \""Star Wars\"" I feel and should be seen by all the fans of \""Star Trek\"" \""Star Wars\"" \""Battlestar Galactica\"" \""Babylon Five\"" and \""Firefly\"". It kept my attention throughout the movie and provided the continuity needed to continue the \""Firefly\"" storyline. It reacquainted me with all the characters of \""Firefly\"" and made the continuation of that TV series a must for all its'fans. I highly recommend that everyone see this movie. I am sure that it will be extremely successful at the box office and hope with that success it will lead to a permanent series both on TV and at the Movies.\tSerenity is based on the very short-lived TV series Firefly. So short-lived that the final episodes from the first and only season are only available on DVD.I don't know why the TV show was not a success. The movie is awesome. It is like the Old West meets Star Wars. Capt. Malcolm \""Mal\"" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) plays a pseudo Robin Hood and leads a band of 'space cowboys'. Mostly comprised of former soldiers  Serenity's (the ship's) crew fought the Alliance for the outer-rim planets during the war. A war they lost. Now  this crew robs the Alliance government at times to keep their ship running  but mostly to stay free. But when they uncover a very dark secret of the Alliance  they have something new to fight for.I never saw the original show  but this movie makes me want to go buy the DVDs. It has a lot of action and  from fans of the show  it holds up well with the series. I think most fans are really going to love this movie.\tI wasn't sure what to expect walking into this movie  I was a huge fan of the series  but I wasn't too sure how it would translate into a movie  Silly Me. I don't cry in movies  I did in Serenity. I don't cheer in movies  I did in Serenity. This movies takes what was an incredible television series  and elevates it and completes it so well. Not every subplot was taken care of  but that didn't matter  there was this incredible sense of closure. Great plot  incredible performances  and not a boring bit the whole way through. Hopefully this movie will do well and the 2 planned sequels will go ahead. The only reason I don't give this 10 out of 10 is that I believe something can always be better  I just can't think of how right now. Watch the TV series  then see this movie you will be astounded.\t:O thats about all i can say  just came home from one of Australia's Advanced Screening->http://www.serenitymovie.com.au/screenings.htmlWe had the final print aired at our screening +a message from Joss Whedon the director  And Every one loved it..this is the must see movie of the year only 1 month +1day till it open in the US and only 1month today till it officially opens here in Aus..If you don't go and see this you will be missing out... Got and pre-book your tickets now...../chame\t**Contains Spoiler** **Spoiler alert**I was really upset by certain parts of this film. OK so  Joss Whedon had something to say  and part of what he is about is unexpectedness and killing off important characters is part of that whole process. But come on  what a huge mistake he has made with the main person who has been killed off in this film. What was Joss Whedon thinking? Has he actually thought out what this means? Everyone else on this site is talking about how huge this will be and how everyone will go for this film and there will be sequels  etc. Well I now go on record to say that  in my opinion  he has probably blown his chances of a sequel. It just makes no sense in what he has done. He has destroyed the heart of his series  the one person who brought the \""everyperson\"" type of humanity to the show. It is really inexplicable as to how he could have done this  how the characters and storyline have been allowed to be sidelined by the death of one special character. The film for me then becomes negated by this death. I know life is something that cannot be taken for granted and that unexpected things do happen  but the inconsistency in the manner of the death of this character  and the fact that this character died in that particular place as well  does not seem possible. I realise that it is too late to do this  but I cannot understand why you are letting this version run when it is so inconsistent and unbelievable  as well as just plain ridiculous. I would firmly suggest alternate endings on the DVD which will inevitably come out and which my family will buy. We are not totally unhappy with this film  in fact it was otherwise really well done  and we loved the script in the main. Well Joss you have obviously aimed to shock and you have succeeded in that. But I am very disappointed and disillusioned. The fans have stood by you to great effect  so why have you taken away the best character in the whole series? If there is any way to do a prequel or to bring this character back  I would strongly suggest doing just that if you are able to get another film or series off the ground which I do honestly doubt now. Thanks for all the effort you have put in though  and for giving the actors a chance to reprise their TV roles on the big screen  which they have done to very great effect.\tThanks to the magic of DVD I got to become a late Firefly fan and now can't wait for the movie. I'm sending the DVD set to all my family and buddies in hopes that they too get hooked and that movie does well and so there are sequels and also the series comes back.Go Serenity go! If you are just browsing this page and have not seen the show order the DVD now. But you should promise yourself that you will only watch one a day! No sitting down and thinking you'll just watch one and getting up very much later a little bug-eyed but deeply troubled as you realise you've watched them all and that now that you're an addict - there are no more.\tI was put aback when this great TV show was canceled in it's 1st season. I hope by bringing this movie to theaters will re inspire the networks to change their minds on bringing it back to fans. This show as so much potential for future growth.. I only hope others that feel this way will also try and convince the networks. It is so rare anymore to find a truly great show that has such an engaging format. i have always loved scifi type shows  and this one is no exception. I only hope that one day we will have Firefly back on the air for future generations to enjoy. I know my children will love this as they have taken to scifi as well by being around me. Thanks to you all for supporting this show.\tI enjoyed the Firefly series and gradually became a fan. This fact may have clouded my vision somewhat but I have tried to be as concise and objective as possible  so straight in...The start of the film is very cleverly worked. Many things are explained in several different formats  with each inadvertently introducing the next until you are faced with a rough idea of what the situation is. A couple of characters are involved here so you get the general gist. I can imagine many people unfamiliar with the Firefly series prematurely presuming lead character roles from the offset  but you soon realise that this is a film for all the characters. As the film begins to progress \u2013 at first with a reasonably light witty tone \u2013 you can see how each member of the crew assumes their position aboard the space ship Serenity. I felt this part of the film was extremely well written  with a good balance of dialogue for all of the characters and a buoyant rhythm. The witty remarks slowly give way to minor conflict and the generally amiable crew begin to show sides of their personalities that were not revealed during the Firefly series. This opens the door for subtleties in character that affect the course of events and how decisions are made  providing a little more believability when characters do make decisions \u2013 once again  excellent writing.The film score mixes typically classical ambient music with Americana tinged folk guitar. It should age well and not inadvertently date the film as so many Nu-Metal soundtracks of this era and genre surely will. This musical mixture works well and assists with mood setting \u2013 as it obviously should \u2013 especially in the final third of the film. When the action heats up and the story becomes clear  a few good emotional twists and turns really capture your attention. This part of the film will definitely appeal more to Firefly fans. Anyone else  with less of a vested interest in the characters may not get as much out of these scenes. This  I fear will be the case for quite a few of the 'moments' during the film  that to one may appear inspired  but to another just a tool for plot progression.As the film races toward the climax you are given a real sense of apprehension and you are truly unsure about what will happen \u2013 both to the characters and to the larger elements of the story.The end of the film is totally believable and logical while still maintaining realism  faithfulness to characters and an action packed finale. All this is wrapped up nicely  leaving many feelings \u2013 all of which positive.This is a warm  complex  yet effortlessly performed story about good and evil (where good and evil are not so clearly defined). It is a film where \u2013 if told from different perspectives and following different characters\u2013 you would have a completely different opinion about which characters are good and which are evil. I really like how this is done. The writer has done a sterling job of raising a few moral issues and he acknowledges the grey areas of human morality and it feels quite refreshing. This is truly a good film in many ways. The humour may begin to tire the dry and more cynical among us  and the overall premise  and story may seem slightly misplaced to others  but these are criticisms I have laboured to find  and don't personally agree with. Seriously  go and see it\tFirefly moves from the little screen to the big one with minimal hiccups. Saw the pre-release in May that even was without all effects and music and it was still good. Because we watched the show  there were lots of extremely tense moments but the best part was that if someone hadn't seen the show  they'd be able to enjoy a romping space western too. The movie is consistent with it's own story line and details. There are several unexpected events that leave you reeling in your seat. The characters are what make this movie worth watching. As for myself.. well.. I'll be there opening night to see the finished product. Adam Baldwin is used heavily as a marketing tool on this film and while he is his always excellent self  his part in the movie was smaller than originally anticipated.\tOK  so I was worried about this film.I had seen Firefly and enjoyed it. Lots of people had told me that the film was fantastic but there was a hardcore of people that had seen it that didn't think so.I think it's safe to say that I have no idea what they were on about. Well I think I know what their problem is - but this is a Joss Whedon film  what were they expecting...The film surpassed my (very high) expectations.Would recommend it to anyone who likes any of the following: Sci-Fi  Action  Comedy  Horror.The film effortlessly blends these (and a few more) genres and works really well too.Ed\tI'll start by making it clear  I am a fan of Firefly and of Joss Whedon's writing. That being said  I am not afraid of pointing out any negatives in what he produces. His fans are often his biggest critics. Some people dismiss his writing because they feel that the characters are too witty or some such. I urge even those people to give Serenity a chance  if disbelief can be suspended to imagine a universe of the future  surely the same can be done for unrealistic wit of the dialogue.So  on to the film. As an adaptation of a television series that many in the audience wont have seen  the start of Serenity needs to be exposition heavy. It is. And as it started  I feared that it would collapse under the weight of the back story to be told. It unfolded  becoming a story within a flashback within a simulation  and we're introduced to the infinitely creepifying Operative. I heard this film was going to go to some dark places... this scene re-assured me that was the case. I almost forgot I was watching exposition-overload.During the second most lengthly shot I've seen this year (the other was Russian Ark)  we're re-introduced to all the characters from the series. Then we're straight into the thick of it. Up until this point  we've just been cranking our way to the top of the roller-coaster. Now we're finally about to be let go  and one word is all that it takes.Reavers.Serenity doesn't seem to let you breathe for a moment  effortlessly flitting between hilarity  tragedy  drama and action (sometimes in the same second). Although the plot is ultimately fairly straightforward  the journey that brings you to the end is what matters - and it's a damn good one.At a time when there seems to be nothing but effects-driven science fiction (with the exception of a few notable smaller-budged efforts such as Donnie Darko)  it's great to have a script that cares about it's characters as much as the events.To any Star Wars fans looking for that 1977 magic. To any Star Trek fans looking for characters to care about. This is your next port of call.Serenity is science-fiction at it's finest.And if you get a chance  catch Firefly on DVD first.\tIt's a horrible comment to make  perhaps off-putting to some but true all the same - Serenity is a very brave film. Not only for Whedon to debut as a feature director with a space epic. Or to resurrect a show 'deemed'  a failure (the DVD sales and illegal downloads of the show while it screened suggest otherwise). To fashion a film  a genre film  that tackles the theme Joss has chosen for Serenity is a bold and brilliant move. Sci-fi has of late been degraded even further from its origins as imaginative romance and speculative fiction to blockbuster clutter. Many tub-thumping 'epics'  of the last few years are guilty of this. Serenity redresses the balance.And hey. Space battles. Cool ;-)\tThis movie is awesome! Every detail  line  and scene is absolutely perfect! You felt every emotion in the movie: you cried when it was sad  you laughed when Mal cracked a joke and you were left wanting more throughout the whole movie. The dialog was amazing. It felt like this was really happening and these people were right in front of you! The fight scenes were excellent! Even if it was choreographed  it still looked very realistic. It wasn't all *punch punch punch* \""Ow.\"" It was major butt-kicking action! If you like Firefly  you'll like this movie. If you like any kind of Western or Sci-fi movie  you'll really like this movie! It's better than all the other stuff Hollywood has been coming out with!\tI have been an avid follower of Joss's work for many years. The cancellation of Firefly TV series (upon which this movie is based) broke my heart. This film more than remedies the situation. It is more than just another episode of Firefly. This is the culmination of all the years of effort that Joss has put into his TV work  brought to life with a big film budget.My only complaint is that I felt the story moved a little quicker than I would have liked. This is not so much a criticism of the film so much as a limitation of the medium. On TV  this story could be paced out across a season and more time spent on exploring the details more carefully.That said though  there are things in this movie that could never have been achieved on television  and not just from a visual standpoint  but also a narrative one. And in the end  this is what makes this a wholly satisfying experience.Without a doubt  my number one film of 2005.\tI was lucky enough to get a ticket to a special preview showing in London of Serenity. I cant say I was a massive fan of the TV show  it took me a long while to really get into it. Once viewed I was really looking forward to seeing the movie  through word of mouth I had heard it was a damn fine film. Now having seen it I can confirm it is the most satisfying movie I have seen this year. Everything about this movie is enjoyable from the effects to the script to the action. This movie doesn't disappoint... no spoilers here  just go see it when it opens.. A Massive bonus was a 30 minute Q&A with Joss Whedon and Summer Glau who were both very engaging and funny..\tprior  my favorite movies were star wars and gone with the wind-- no joke  now it's Serenity. I was lucky enough to catch a preview  and all I can say is  it's brilliant. The writing  the cinematography  everything-- every single second of the movie is refined to the very last bit. I laughed while crying  cried while laughing-- easily  EASILY  the best movie i have ever seen in my life. Unfortunately-- I'm going nuts not talking about it  as it defies most conventional movie rules-- talking about it too much gives it away  but suffice to say-- amazing even self-contained  but all the more amazing if you're a fan of the show."""
Sideways (2004),"I had heard about this movie from friends and finally got around to watching it. What a great film!!!! Rarely anymore do films and the actors excite me as much as this film did.The story of 2 middle aged men  both in the throes of a middle life crisis  heading up to Northern California wine country is an absolute hoot. The writing  acting and directing are top notch. Paul Giammetti is excellent as the wine snob  self loathing Miles. Thomas Haden Church is a hoot as Jack  the groom to be who is determined to sleep his way through wine country on the eve of his impending nuptials. Miles quiet desperation is so dead on  I am amazed that the Academy didn't even nominate him for Best Actor.This movie is a delight from start to finish.\tI have seen all the big movies of 2004 now and I am convinced this one is the best  and an all-time excellent piece off work. I have also read the novel  seen the DVD  and listened to the voice-over by Giamatti and Clark.The music  the camera-work  the scenery  the wardrobe  the color  the lighting  the editing  the writing (particularly the adaptation of the novel)  and lots of little touches all contribute to the mood and meaning. They say that comedy is harder than drama. How about a combination of comedy and drama that really works? How about such a combination  where the lead characters are not very attractive? Giamatti is excellent  but so is Clark. Lots of acting with little glances and subtle body movements. Madsen is perfectly cast and her character well-played. Many find that the interaction between Miles and Maya is not credible. It seems to me that Maya and Miles are both more than deep enough for this to resemble real life more than the movies.This may not be the most profound movie ever made  and it may not advance movie-making on a technical or technique level  but this is a very good film  all around.\tThe film itself is good but the two sociopaths it has for main characters made it hard for me to actually like the film.On the positive side  the depiction of depression was accurate. And....Hmmm. Well  two of the characters were intelligent and thoughtful. That's rare and that aspect was enjoyable.Some of the sociopathic antics made for a laugh or two.The film was well paced and decently written.The depiction of the pursuit of a thoughtful romantic relationship was enjoyable  especially as it was contrasted with an entirely thoughtless but passionate romantic relationship.As I say  a good film  but all throughout I thought the two of them should be in jail or a mental institution.It made me nauseated to think that perhaps society was coming to celebrate such narcissistic ethics.\tI cannot believe how dumb that movie was !8.0 ??? You people really made your homework ! Most of my friends have slept instead of watching it  you can take it instead of sleeping pills. IMDb  i think you really should put vote 0 (zero) - it's the most appropriate for \sideways\"". What can you say about the cast ? Music ? Screenplay ? I think there must be some rating on the cover about that kind of movies - one five inches big \""D\"" on the front. This is no joke  otherwise how can we be protected from that kind of junk ? I haven't seen a movie so ugly since \""armageddon\"" pop-up. come on  we can count to three  come on now  some people even can count to ten. how bad level we can reach till bang the alarm ? STOP THIS\tIf you like Curve Your Enthusiasm  you'll most likely enjoy this movie -- it has the flavour of Woody Allen on lithium. What I can say in favour of this movie is that the cinematography was great... there were some beautiful scenes. But then often I felt as though I was being sold on wine country  and that the flick was nothing more than propaganda/advertising for California wines. But I'm a tough critique (since I was raised in wine country). Rolfe Kent made the movie what it is  and if it wasn't for him and Virginia Madsen I'd have given it a 0 out of 10. He created the perfect  jazzy atmosphere  that had you roaming through the back roads of wine country  tasting here  sloshing there. Virginia Madsen  I will add  absolutely glowed -- her character was as well-rounded in bouquet as a fine cabernet sauvignon. She *was* the movie (particularly the scene where she described why she likes wine). And Sandra Oh is always a good actress. No matter what she plays  she delivers. But Paul Giamatti was soooooooooo boring. I almost shut the movie off three times  but persisted only because I hoped it would get better. The only scene Giamatti showed promise in was when he ran down the hill like a madman into the vineyard with that bottle of wine. I laughed out loud. Otherwise  there was only one other scene that got a rise out of me  and that was when they were playing golf. I imagine it's because we've all been there  and dreamt of doing exactly what they did to the obnoxious players coming up from hind quarters. Thomas Haden Church was there  though he came across too much as a Nick Nolte knock-off. Sorry guys  I rate this movie 2 out of 10.\tTwo middle-age guys decide to take a week traveling around central California  intending to visit wineries  taste wines  have a pleasant and relaxing time  and enjoy each other's company. Well  it doesn't work out that way. Instead  the trip becomes an adventure of self-exploration and self-discovery revealing complex characters in search of personal fulfillment. One guy wants to drink  the other guy wants to party. But the premise of the story is not what makes this movie so enjoyable. It's the actors and actresses that make this movie happen. They transform rather commonplace characters into people we want to know and care about. Also  the cinematography adds to the surrealistic quality of the movie  which renders the movie more esthetically pleasing. Excellent movie.\tThis movie was the most pretentious crap I have ever seen. Thomas Haiden Church nominated for an Academy Award? Really?! His was the most stilted  obnoxious performance of the year. The only thing good about this movie was Giamatti's performance. that is the only thing that deserved credit in this movie and yet the only that the Academy seemed to snub. This once again goes to show how self- absorbed the Academy has become. This movie only appeals to the upper-crust elitists who enjoy pretending to poke fun at their own superiority while at the same time mocking the less refined  laughing not because the jokes are funny but because they feel giddy that they are sophisticated enough to get them. Give me a break!\tI was shocked to see on the DVD case that 'Sideways' has won 3 major film awards and even has comments saying it is 'The funniest film of the year' and 'Unmissable'. For me  'Sideways' was a struggle to watch and three quarters of the way through I gave up. (Apologizes to anyone who watched it all the way through  where it apparently picked up  according to my Dad) The 'funniest film of the year' certainly didn't live up to its praise  I hardly laughed at all and when there was any humour  it was hardly side-splitting. For example  Jack chases Miles down a steep hillside with amusing music in the background: award- winning comedy? The boring scenes where we a silent Jack and Miles driving through the vineyard-full countryside are completely pointless  even using split-screens doesn't liven boring snapshots of roadsides and wildlife. There didn't seem any attempt at making wine interesting to anyone who knew nothing about it  which was odd because it became the main feature of the film. Jokes about Pinot wines washed over me completely. Even though the acting seemed to be good  it still couldn't endear me to these two awful characters. Jack is foul-mouthed  arrogant and a cheat  whilst Miles is a slightly creepy  wine lover who spends his time writing rubbish and steals from his mother. If you do decide to watch this film  make sure you have a good book or your I-Pod with you.\tSixth movie from Alexander Payne  who also directed \""About Schmidt\"" with Jack Nicholson and \""Election\"" with Reese Witherspoon. In \""Sideways\"" we see Paul Giamatti in one of the leading roles  who gives in an irreproachable way shape to the depressed and melancholic Miles. Miles is a man who doesn't succeed in getting over his divorce. He tries to write down his experiences and misery in a book but until now  no publisher was willing to publish it. Even by being on a trip with his best friend Jack and going out with the beautiful waitress Maya (they know each other already a couple of years)  doesn't make him any happier.Sometimes Miles' awkwardness may seem a little funny  but most of the time you just feel sorry for him. The guy didn't knew much happiness in his life and it seems that everything he tries to do  just fails: his marriage  his writing \u0085his whole life.Beautiful story and excellent acting performances by Paul Giamatti and Virginia Madsen. Madsen is wonderful as the vulnerable and broken waitress  desperately looking for a decent an honest man. Payne made again an excellent movie about lonely people  looking for some affection  just like Nicholson's character in \""About Schmidt\"".9/10\tI decided to watch this film for two reasons: First  many people around me were raving about it  and second  I had loved Payne's previous film \""About Schmid\"". The latter film was truly honest  at times really comical  at times really tragic  and very philosophical. However  even though \""Sideways\"" appears to be set along similar lines -- some not so successful middle aged white males searching for meaning in their lives -- I found almost nothing of the spirit of \""About Schmid\"" in Payne's new film. It may be that my appreciation of \""About Schmid\"" has intensified my disappointment with \""Sideways\""; however  I might not even have watched the latter had I not known that it was made by the director of the former.Sorry to say  but \""Sideways\""  in my view  is nothing but a teeny-style film for adults. Interestingly  in my experience  it is a teeny-style film that seems to be appreciated especially in academic circles. I wonder why. Is it the \""wine\"" background of the story? Is it the main character who is presented as an attempting but unsuccessful novelist? Both are not very interesting. I personally do not like the taste of oak barrel  which is common to Californian wines  but much prefer good Italian wines. \""Sideways\"" certainly hasn't made me appreciate Californian wine to the extent that \""Babette's Feast\"" made me appreciate well-prepared and sophisticated meals.Again  what is intellectually interesting about someone who unsuccessfully tries to get a novel published if we hardly get to know anything about the novel itself? We learn only in the end -- through Maya's voice mail message -- that the content seems to be somehow autobiographical. Miles is obviously just a narcissist if he wants to publish an autobiographical novel about a not very interesting life and believes that it may be accepted. That by itself may not be decisive -- you do not need to be able to identify with the main characters or want to invite them over for dinner  as one reviewer pointed out. However  since the content of the novel does not become any issue in the film except as a means to secure Miles's love interest Maya  we are left with the general idea that the main motive to publish a novel is to be 'loved' by people and that there is not really much else to it. And this is not just what we think is Miles' own personal motive -- it's what the film itself tells us by not dwelling on the content of the book that he had written. Is that interesting? Otherwise  the film centers around Hollywood clich\u00e9s about the nature of (white male upper middle class US-American) midlife crises; it never stops centering on sex and (heterosexual) love interests. There is nothing else; no politics  no philosophical reflections on life  no really interesting issues taken up. The only interesting character seems to be Maya -- but she is  like all younger women in the film -- reduced to a mere love interest. This is another strong message the film sends out: Young females are interesting only inasmuch as they are potential objects of sex or sexual love. Overall  the film reduces all our human problems to finding a suitable (hetero)sexual partner. Once you found one you'll be happy  and all the rest is unimportant.I was bored to death also by some \""comical\"" scenes like the one in which Miles grabs Jack's wallet from the waitress's home in the middle of her having sexual intercourse with her husband -- this is pure teenager stuff  sorry! And seeing Bush and Rumsfeld on the TV screen in the background during that event does not add any more wit to that scene  or to the film in general  for that matter...Finally  we do not only not understand what actually keeps the two male buddies together  apart from the mere fact that they had been 'freshmen roommates at San Diego State'  but we understand even less what keeps the two female 'best friends' together. Do we ever see them being engaged in a conversation? We know they must talk to each other  otherwise the plot wouldn't have worked out (i.e.  when Maya tells Jennifer about Jack's upcoming marriage). However  all we get to know about their conversations is that they are just about guys... But at the same time we are encouraged to think that Maya is somehow intellectually interested and smart.Whoever finds this film realistic must live in a very shallow culture and know nothing else. To be sure  I do not mind if films are unrealistic. However  I do mind if a film gets overrated that bores one to death with cheap Hollywood clich\u00e9s while at the same time trying -- and apparently succeeding -- to appeal to large crowds of people who think of themselves as educated and progressive.\tHave you ever been down on your luck? Did you ever find yourself drinking as a result? Ever want to kill yourself but can't because you need to be published first before anyone will care? Miles sure has. He is the focus of this book to movie comedy about a writer who goes on a bachelor trip with his soon-to-be married roommate from college  Jack.The back story for this movie is that Miles  a wine connoisseur  has written a book and is trying (unsuccessfully) to get it published. His best friend Jack is going to get married and they are going on a wine tasting tour of California to see his freedom away properly.Miles character is very depressed every since he and his wife got divorced about a year or so ago. He spends most of his time on wine and his middle school teaching job. Jack is a free spirited  and sometimes crude  character. This provides the perfect setting for a comedy of errors. Miles wants to stick to the agenda he set up for the trip  but Jack just wants to get laid and get Miles laid also. Miles  on the other hand  sees the reality of Jack's childish ways as a possible marriage destroyer of a marriage that hasn't even happened yet.They go to a small Inn next to a wine bar and restaurant where we get to meet Maya  Miles soon to be love interest. Maya is a quiet girl that speaks loud on the screen with her silent emotions. Miles likes her but is still hanging on to his ex and doesn't want to start another heart breaking relationship. The next day they go to a winery and we meet Stephanie  who will become Jack's infatuation over the remainder of the trip. Jack sets up a double date for Miles and him with Stephanie and Maya. All hell breaks loose  but slowly over the remainder of the film.Beautiful scenery and rich  full characters drive this well thought out and heart breaking plot that makes you laugh and cry and sometimes laugh until you cry.Sometimes people say to \""avoid\"" movies at all costs  but this is one you need to \""see\"" at all costs. Please enjoy!\tI cannot believe all the hype this movie received. Except for the acting  which was totally brilliant  I was stunned as to how bad this movie was by the first five minutes into it. This is the worst movie I have seen since 13th Warrior.First  throughout the whole movie there are totally rude and degrading comments about 8th grade English teachers. As if that were the worst job in the world. Well  I didn't like most of my English teachers  but I see as an adult  that the teaching of children is the most noble of all professions. Why this movie would go out of its way to disrespect them  I have no idea.Miles is a man so horrible that he steals money from his own mother. His best attribute is that he is self-hating. For that character  its a good attribute  because he is an alcoholic  thieving liar.Jack  the other main character of the movie  is also scum. He is a liar and a disgusting womanizer. Days before his marriage  his only goal is to shag anything that moves  without a care for his targets.This movie is so totally unrealistic. Why would a beautiful and confident woman like Maya date a pudgy  depressed moron like Miles? How is this movie supposed to inspire us? What are we to learn from this? That humans are fragile and hopelessly weak? Are we to learn that stealing from family and ruthlessly breaking peoples hearts is OK? Avoid this movie  unless you accept living with \""diminished expectations\"" is acceptable.\tI have a hard time understanding the hype around this film. Really  what is the fuzz about? It's a well acted  easy going story about a couple of friends taking a grown-up bachelors vacation. One of them is on the verge to get married  and is on a rampage to consume his last days before marriage  the other is still not recovered after a failed marriage  and is the virgin soul among the two. They will get involved with a couple of waitresses in California wine country  the one who seems solidly involved will get kicked-off (physically and all)  the less involved one will become more involved  etc. The film never decides if it's a comedy  a romantic story  or a TV good-life show. Maybe it's a combination of the three  not a bad one  but this story about the problems of people with no problems is so boring  that the verbose wine production conferences are some of the more exciting lines in the movie. The previous film of the director was 'About Schmidt'  on the same line  but at least that one had the fabulous Jack Nicholson acting.Again  not a bad film  professionally made  but minor completely devoid of any interesting story  characters  or subject. The fact that it was a Oscar contender speaks only about a poor year in the American cinema history  but why should we be astonished taking into account that the big winner of the year was 'Aviator'.\tWhat a great movie this played out to be! It tells a story of two friends and their last vacation together in California's wine country. The two friends are some sort of yin-yang composition. Both are presented as semi-losers but the difference is that only one of them (i.e. Miles) is aware of it.This movie works on so many levels. Most often it plays out to be a comedy although sometimes the humor is not explicitly available for the viewer. Sometimes it is a drama and sometimes it is a feel-good experience.The strongest points of Sideways are the cast and the dialog.My favorite lines: \""Jack: If they want to drink Merlot  we're drinking Merlot. Miles Raymond: No  if anyone orders Merlot  I'm leaving. I am NOT drinking any fuxxing Merlot! My favorite scene: Miles opening the old bottle of wine in the fast-food restaurant.Score: 10 of 10\tI love wine  I am not an alcoholic  I am from Chile  Central Region which produces one of the greatest wines in the world  my first language is Spanish  so please I apologize for my English...for some strange reasons I live in Dubai  the Middle East...trouble times around...near by. I am a musician I play my electric guitar charged with Hendrix  Clapton and Santana...Sideways  what a great film. My wife is English from Oxford  we watched this film together in our house  I thought it was going to be rubbish  20 minutes passed and we just wanted to have some red wine  we did and continue with the film. I could see myself sometimes or a friend...the acting was excellent. I had to really checked twice to make sure it was an American film. Giamatti just amazing an his friend (Thomas Haden Church) just the best mate. I was just feeling so positive and happy that I saw such a good film that is not over the top as most of the Hollywood productions that I forget a half second after I saw them. Human and touching...deserves the best of the Chilean Pinots...Californian ones are great too.\tA week before the marriage of his great friend  the decadent actor Jack (Thomas Haden Church)  the bitter frustrated writer divorced oenologist English teacher Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti) travels with him to the wine country of California to spend a week together. While Miles intends to drink wine and play golf  Jack indeed intends to score and get laid with as many women as possible. While hosted in the Windmill Inn  they meet the waitress Maya (Virginia Madsen) and the attendant Stephanie (Sandra Oh)  and they spend some time together  visiting different wine makers and Miles and Maya disclosing their inner secrets and falling in love for each other.\""Sideways\"" is a very simple  but delightful romance  based on the strong performances of Paul Giamatti  Thomas Haden Church  Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh. Their characters are very human  complex  with flaws in the personality  but very well developed along approximately two hours. There are drama  romance and comedy in rights doses  and the story is never dull or boring. There are many funny  intelligent and sensitive dialogs  the situations are very believable and fans of wine will certainly love the discussions of oenology. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \""Sideways \u0096 Entre Umas e Outras\"" (\""Sideways \u0096 While Drinking\"")\tTake 2 pathetic characters  mix with generous proportions of vulgarity and repetitious profanity  and you have this childish attempt at entertainment. This insipid movie is not advised for anyone over 13.Enough said. However  I will try to recall what I have striven to repress in my memory ...If you are in the unfortunate position of being cognizant throughout the movie  you can note these factors along the way. Two men embark upon a \""road trip\"" into the wine valleys of California. One  a failed writer  is Miles who is a man without confidence and seemingly without hope. He is also a character with whom the viewer does not wish to identify. Yet  the other \""protagonist \"" Jack  is without brains or character. He has been reduced to a life support system for his genitals  and his sole purpose throughout the movie is to seduce someone other than his fianc\u00e9  whom he is destined to marry soon after the trip. Jack is an even more repulsive character than Miles.For fear of creating a spoiler  I will not divulge if Jack succeeds. (Who cares.) I will also not divulge if Miles overcomes his confidence issues. (Again  who cares.) Yet  the hilarious antics in-between the beginning and end will leave 12-year-olds rolling in the aisles. For adults  the childish gags and predictable \""humor\"" will be boring  the language grating  and the characterizations lacking in appeal.If there is any redeeming value for this movie  it is regarding pinot noir. Being highlighted frequently through the movie as Miles' favorite  it definitely evokes curiosity about pinot noir and wine tasting in general. This much over-looked wine deserves a boost in appreciation such that it competes with the chardonnays  Rieslings  and other popular white wines. It was known to the Romans  and it's historical value alone should encourage everyone to try it.And prior to watching this flotsam of the movie industry  I encourage anyone (over 21 and at home) to imbibe heavily in pinot noir as it may improve the movie (or destroy any memory of it). Further  it may induce drowsiness and sleep soon after the opening. This will mercifully allow one to doze through the remainder of the ordeal. I gave this movie a \""1 for awful\"" because \""0 for abysmal\"" was not available.\tSideways is Alexander Payne's masterpiece. A drama/comedy that is both intellectually interesting and very funny. With great performances  smart direction and a great Payne script  this film is perfect. Giamatti is perfectly cast and does a great job here  my favorite of the film (although the academy only gave nods to Church and Madsen). I thought the whole cast was good  even the director's wife (soon to be divorced)  Sandra oh  who was very believable as a liberal swinger chick. I also loved Thomas Haden church  who is very believable as a television actor  it sort of fit him for me since I was actually used to seeing him on TV show Wings. Virginia Madsen was also great  and in my opinion gives an Oscar worthy performance here. The film's script is great  good work from Payne and longtime collaborator Jim Taylor. Its the best part about the film  i mean i would have never thought I would be so interested in a film that had dialogues about winetasting and wine types throughout  but it worked. This film is perfect  an instant favorite of mine  10/10 #60 on my list of all-time favorite films\tVirginia Madsen has always felt to me like the one who got away. Like an Eighties Monica Potter she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time in the wrong films  one breakthrough moment away from being a household name. Horror fans might know her work in Candyman and fantasy fans will have noticed she was in Highlander 2 as they were walking out. But to me she's Madeline in the prophetic Electric Dreams  breaking three hearts at the same time  Miles Harding  his computer and mine. Now here she is in the fantastic Sideways one nomination away from a statue. I think she's basically finally won hearts via a single speech she gives at the heart of the film in which her character Maya explains why she loves wine. I won't give away the details  but by the end you'll love wine and love her too.But that's one of the great things about Sideways -- the chance to see actors I've whose work I loved for years  which no one else has heard of in something which everyone is talking about. I was afraid Paul Giamatti was going to end up being 'the guy from American Splendor' for the rest of his career but here people are putting a name to a face they've been seeing for years. Look at his filmography there are very few films you haven't heard of. In fact in some he's even played proto-Miles  especially Bruce Paltrow's Duets in which karaoke was his love instead. Sandra Oh might look like a discovery but she's equally always been busy (Bean: The Ultimate Disaster Film to Under the Tuscan Sun). I remember her from Last Night and The Red Violin in which she had a quiet dignity far removed from Stephanie. If I'm being honest though I've never watched the sitcom Wings so I don't know about the cult of Thomas Haden Church. But is in George of the Jungle which is good enough for me.In casting these actors  Alexander Payne knew exactly what he was doing. Apparently George Clooney was actively campaigning for Giamatti's part. Extrapolating that further  we could have ended up with Brad Pitt  Julia Roberts and introducing some young actress. All perfectly fine actors and they would have essayed their roles well  and the chemistry would have been there  but it would have felt false -- this didn't need a successful cast -- a dream cast. It needed a group of actors who all seemed kind of familiar without being 'famous' because these are characters who are just like us or people we know. Very refreshing.\tThis movie seems to elicit extreme opinions at both ends of the spectrum. I am at the positive end  because it resonated with me enormously. It showed the contrast between two men; Jack- an insensitive overgrown teenager having a final fling before getting married  and Miles - a sensitive self-absorbed loser whose life is getting worse. The contrast is brought out in their relationships with the two women  and the urgent rush into infidelity by Jack and the hesitant approach of Miles and Maya that pays off. I loved the emotional content of Miles and Maya's relationship  one that has to bring hope to lonely people - never give up.I think that those who have condemned this movie have had different life experiences or have little patience with people who struggle. Entering into the situations of the characters is very rewarding. I know nothing about wine  don't even drink it  but the pretentiousness of the wine-talk was funny and oiled the wheels of the story."""
Sin City (2005),"Sin City is the delightful and devilish idea from the mind of imaginative Frank Miller. The remake of the comic is stylish film noir at its best. This sexy movie weaves three stories into one but each story has one thing in common: they're all in Basin City - a place infested with crooked cops  gangs and prostitutes. The first story is about Hartigan (Bruce Willis) - the rogue cop  one man absolutely determined to save a little girl from the hands of a sexual predator. The second is the story of Marv (Mickey Rourke)  an apeish ex-con wishing to avenge the murder of his beloved Golde. Lastly  the gorgeous Dwight (Clive Owen) - a guy just wanting to look out for his barmaid girlfriend (Brittany Murphy) but ends up in a war between crooked cops and prostitutes  lead by Gail (Rosario Dawson).The performances were outstanding. Mickey Rourke shone as Marv  and Benicio Del Toro plays a great Jackie Boy. Bruce Willis and Clive Owen both put in solid performances for their respective characters. I was surprised at Brittany Murphy's performance  which in my opinion was definitely her best. Rosario Dawson  Jessica Alba (Nancy) and Jaime King (Wendy/Golde) all put in sexy performances. The only disappointing performance was by Alexis Bledel (Becky) - I felt her a little flat and one dimensional  but this did not detract from the movie.The best thing about this movie was the bold  stylish and VERY daring cinematography. It is shot in black and white  with splotches of colour every now and again (a red dress  blue eyes  etc.). I wouldn't be surprised if this movie got a few Oscars under its belt for this alone. The movie borders into fantasy  but never quite makes that step  which is a bold move by Rodriguez. The heroes do not wear capes  don't fly or have special powers  but there is something unnatural about them that is never explained.The movie was an accurate representation of the comics  and I believe is a masterpiece of modern popular culture. Definitely *the* best comic book remake to date  and all in all  thoroughly entertaining. 4.5/5 stars.\tWhat can I say? Beautiful film. Those who can't see art in the form of comic book language are truly blind idiots. I wasn't a fan of Frank Miller's Sin City novels  I was just a casual reader back in my comic- book buying days  but I clearly remember a lot of panels and moments that I read  and still have them fresh in my mind. Having witnessed Robert Rodriguez's Sin City I am just speechless. It's a beautiful film encapsulated in a very violent \u0096for a mainstream film\u0096 package. This is the way this material was to be done. All of the characters are like a trash can where you can reach into and find something beautiful inside. I have these clear images of Marv's story from the comics in my head  and the way it's done here\u0085 Gee  it's astonishing. Everything's been said about this movie  and I'm thankful Rodriguez could capture all of it's violence and humanity in just two hours. Great indeed.\twow!!! firstly i had a real high expectation for this film being that members of my family were huge sin city fans. spent many days checking the cast details and which stories they would include. three things struck a chord.... mickey Rourke as Marv  the former boxer wasn't exactly my first choice as Marv  especially after his role in once upon a time in Mexico(stupid dog). Elijah wood as Kevin  i just couldn't see past the hobbit  shallow i know. but i still remember the faculty. his speciality is nerdy! lastly the point that the film would be made mostly cgi  now i'm a fan of special effects as much as the next person but too much makes films look like a Sega genesis game. streets of rage instead of sin city. many of you reading this think I'm now bashing the film but what I'm trying to say is that i was so....WRONG!!!! Mickey Rourke is MARV!!!! without a doubt there is no person on this Earth that could have done a better job. Elijah wood was just creepy and good on him  the noir effect on his glasses was divine. and finally the cgi aspect was astounding. Robert did a great job  one for frank miller and his fans to be proud of. in case you haven't seen it  I'm recommending it to all  comic book fans  actions fans...everyone!!!!\t**** Bruce Willis  Clive Owen  Jessica Alba  Devon Aoki  Rosario Dawson  Benicio Del Toro  Michael Clark Duncan  Jaime King  Rutger Hauer  Mickey Rourke. Directed by Frank Miller  Robert Rodriguez and special guest director Quentin Tarantino. Based on the Dark Horse comics Sin City thought up by Frank Miller made into a motion picture by Robert Rodriguez and the creator Miller who co-directs along side with him and Tarantino. The movie shot in classic black and white (which proves movies look better in black and white) and sceams of color illuminating each brilliantly shot sequence and one scene directed by Tarantino. The movie being made early in the year but is definitely one of 2005 best of. Great movie  great comic  and one of the years best. My final rating 10/10.\tSin city is gritty  dark and well dark. You have to be a certain type of person to like this sledgehammer (Using the term literally) of a film. It uses a huge amount of film nior but pulls it off very well. Don't be discouraged by the black and white as you will not even notice it after a while plus it adds to the flavour of the film. Basicaly this movie is an incredibly violent but very cool digitalised comic strip. The three plot lines had good story lines and crunched and splattered at a break neck speed that maintained my attention with ease. Good acting jobs from all the cast with a host of well known and very suitable choices for the main characters. I highly recommend this movie with its extreme (but stylish) gore and excellent portrayal of a city that is too true to its name. Go see it! But ahh don't eat lunch before hand.\tSin City is one of the best efforts I have seen until now to transfer to the big screen a comic book. It totally respects the comic artist's (Frank Miller that is) perspective and makes a decent (and in a great part very successful) effort to transfer it to screen. A great deal of this achievement should be credited (in my opinion) to Frank Miller himself  since not only he co-directed the film with Rodriguez  but also in the first place his Sin City graphic novels are sketched in such a way as to oftentimes give the impression that you have in front of you a storyboard for a film. He has a very cinematographic way of sketching.The aesthetics of the movie is fascinating and the way Rodriguez shot it (having the actors play most of the times in front of blue screens and then drawing the background scenery) in order to give it a more comic-like look has paid off and contributed dearly to the accurate transfer to the screen the biggest part of the comic's dark  claustrophobic and at times surreal atmosphere. I believe that Rodriguez  with Sin City  has set a new standard for the films that are comic book transfers (as was his intention in the first place).A special credit should be given to Mickey Rourke's acting which is excellent. Rourke completely and inspiringly brings to life one of the most touching characters of Sin City (Marv) exactly as presented in the comic. One of his best performances of late.The movie's violence may disturb some  but nobody said that Sin City is a movie for housewives. A rather hilarious remark about the film I heard was while waiting in the line outside the cinema when I went to see it. It came from a middle-aged woman  coming out of the cinema some minutes before the end (god I hate those people) and \warning\"" us: \""Go grab a straw while you are at it  to suck all the blood\"". It is true that the movie is not kind with its audience  but that is the least to be expected when Rodriguez and Miller co-direct and Tarantino special-guest-directs.In the bottom line I thoroughly enjoyed Sin City. Not so much as reading the graphic novels though  but I believe that many will find it even more exciting. Rodriguez's and Miller's inspired direction provides a compelling  dark atmosphere. The great cast gives very good performances (with best of all in my opinion Rourke's) and on top of it all is the scenario with as original stories as any  in our times  can be.A flick definitely worth seeing at least once.\tI saw this piece yesterday at the cinema  and I have to make clear to everyone that I have never been especially into comics by Frank Miller. I guess I have never really give it a fair chance. Anyhow  the piece totally stunned me. I love that the movie is generally in B&W except for some Technicoloreffects  and that really puts a neat \""comic feel\"" to it. I guess the editors captured the feeling of being exposed to a comic  as the whole piece really did feel like a comic  at times reminding me of the movie scenes in the PC game \""Max Payne\"". I think that the story is told in a superb way  and the actors (impressive cast!) don't really surprise us  as we already now what these actors are capable of. See this today  you won't regret it! 8/10!\tClever. Very clever. Much of Frank Miller's original comic book feeling is here  but even more sophisticated.The hardboiled lines are delivered in a hardboiled way  but the emotions are strong. The interesting thing is not the violent vigilante stories  but the stories about love. Love is complicated here. It goes far beyond what you find in comics; even in the ones of Frank Miller. You get interested in these people. Their vigilante actions might be regarded as completely primitive fantasies  but their love actions and shortcomings are from life.Bruce Willis once again shows that he is a really talented actor. Usually he hides it well  but not here. See this  if you can stand lots and lots of yellow and sometimes even red blood. There is sun sometimes even in Sin City.\tSin City is fully based on Frank Miller's graphic novels - series of Sin City. The movie's story is from three albums  1st  3rd and 4th. Visually the movie looks perfectly like the graphic novels. Black and white picture and only some certain things are coloured. Like characters eyes or spilling blood. The cast is another perfect thing in Sin City. The actors look just like in Sin City stories. For example Alba is fantastic Nancy  Willis living image of Hartigan and Mickey Rourke is true Marv. They did everything to make the movie look like Miller's comics and they succeeded in it. Only one bigger thing is different. In Sin City novels when a story ends another begins but in the movie they put two a bit smaller main stories between the biggest story's beginning and end part. Why this when everything else is just like in graphic novels. And about directing. Roberto Rodriguez can make very different kind of movies. In Sin City Rodriguez's mark is best visible even though the script is strongly guided by Miller's comics. Q. Tarantino is mentioned as a special guest director. It's like a mark from the film makers that \""this is a really good movie\"". Knowing Rodriguez and Miller's Sin City  they wouldn't need it. This sells even if it wasn't marked with film directing's biggest name.\tHaving never read any of the comics  and indeed never being a comic fan  i must confess I really enjoyed this film. Simply reading the cast list  reading the American reviews (i live in Australia it only came out in mid July) and eventually seeing the previews I expected I would like the film  but probably not to the extent i did.From start to finish  the way the film is shot  a black and white film with certain part coloured is very effective. The cast all shine in their individual roles. All star cast often seem to fall flat but this is one example where it's really come off well. They'll be pressed to find a cast as good as this for Sin City 2. Certainly a highlight for many is seeing Elijah Wood in a role so completely different from Frodo Baggins of Lord of the Rings.As you would expect from anything that Rodriguez does  and any that Tarrentino has anything to do with  it's a very violent film. Due to the black and white filming  some scenes that are extremely violent or gory are made watchable. I appreciated this. It's not so bad that people will be really turned off by it (people who watch films of this genre that is) and yet it's still extremely cool action.One thing that really impressed me was the dialog. There was no swearing basically the entire film. This is so hard to find now day. It seems if you want to make a kick ass film with lots of action and violence people won't appreciate it unless it's full of the 'f' word. That really frustrates me and is probably my biggest criticism of Tarrentino who's work I still really like. So this was very refreshing.Overall  it's a fantastic film  I've seen in twice in a week and i'm sure i'd still enjoy it if I saw it again. If you know anything of the director  you'll expect there'll be lots of violence and lots of women parading around in little clothing. If you don't want to see that  then don't watch this film. Simple. Don't watch it then come complaining about all that stuff. For most of us who have enough interest to come to this page  I'm confident this film will exceed your expectations.\tI want more blood. I want more heads being chopped off. I want more paedophiles  more prostitutes  more dead bodies  more people being eaten alive. I want it all rendered in beautiful monochrome. In fact  next time  can I have a group of innocent people being massacred in the style of a Rossetti painting  set to... I don't know Holst's Planets. Shocked? Why? Is that your own hypocrisy slapping you round your face?Well  we've come a long way haven't we? We are pass the point where violence is merely accepted in society and art  now we actively relish in it. This is a film that shows as much respect for the human body and soul as Abu Ghraib prison. And this is our 'fun'. This is what we do to chill out and kick back with some friends. Lets watch a massacre. Lets watch suicide and decapitation. Lets make a cup of tea and watch blood spurt out of a mans neck.I'm a 23 year old British liberal  but films like this and Kill Bill make me think that moaning old conservatives might have a point  and I HATE them for that.\""Oh but Dan  you can't seriously believe that films like this make people more violent\"".Who cares if they provoke more violence? Isn't it just a bit disturbing that people are getting off to this junk in the first place??! I wouldn't want any friends of mine to enjoy watching someone getting eaten alive for entertainment.Stop paying for this life-insulting junk.\tThe film could be argued to be involved in a conversation concerning the \""best worst movies ever made\""  as it is successful in creating the certain mood necessary for trash cinema. This noir piece of pulp fiction is filled with the necessary violence and vulgarity to fully envelope the audience so that the film's flabbergasting luridness has them feeling the fun and humour in it  whilst still quezzing uneasily about how this viewing is going to effect them in the future. Genetiles seem to always take centre stage in trash cinema and there is no exception here with the film seemingly revolving around the destroying of genitalia and its attempt to recreate it. I would suggest that Bruce Willis' final barrage of destruction upon his enemy's gentiles will be one of the most remembered scenes of all underground cinema. The cinematography does at times drift from the trash cinema realm to appease a more mainstream audience. The camera work and subsequent shots of Bruce Willis in solitary are definitely a highlight of the film  evoking reminiscence of Scorsese's direction in 'Raging Bull'.Mainstream audiences will struggle to understand the purpose and poise of the film unless they are prepared for the viewing. However  it is still unlikely that they will be able to fully appreciate what the film was created for and what it represents. The film is well worth the time  satisfying those looking for cheap thrills sustained from lurid  unnerving violence and those who wish to critic the film's place among the great pieces of trash cinema.\tRobert Rodriguez doesn't seem to know the word moderation. His movies over the past ten years or so have either consisted of children's flicks like the Spy Kids series or violent bloodfests like the Marachi saga. The idea of an 'M' rated movie seems abhorrent.Which brings us nicely to his latest venture- an adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel series Sin City.This is not a movie for everybody's taste; and although the MA15+ may suggest that already  I find it hard to believe that this got away with a softer rating than Kill Bill Vol. 1 after what some of the characters go through. This is not the sort of cartoonesque violence that made Kill Bill so wild and stylish  rather Rodriguez  Miller and Tarantino ( as a 'guest director' ) show a much more darker and grittier world of violence that is dominated in black in white  with only the odd emphasis of colour.The plot is actually 3 stories- all loosely connected with one another. Bruce Willis stars in the first one as Hartigan- a cop whose early retirement plans are cut short due to a combination of his own obsessions with justice and his partner Bob ( Michael Madsen ); only to find his obsession later on all grown up in the form of Jessica Alba and his nemesis still alive in the form of what can only be described as something seen to be believed. Mickey Rourke in the second story plays Marv- a convict who is determined to get to the bottom of who killed a hooker that spent the night with him. This perhaps sees one of the most interesting performances of the movie in the form of Elijah Wood  who after Frodo Baggins  plays Kevin- a cannibalistic stalker. Finally ( as if two wasn't enough ) there's Dwight ( Clive Owen ) who attempts to help protect the 'sisters' of Old Town led by Gale ( Rosario Dawson ) from the mob and bent cops.All the cast of Sin City really come to the fore  with Owen and Willis in particular standing out and making the gritty neo-30's gangster dialog come to life. The environment is fantastic and one can only applaud Rodriguez for the time he has taken to recreate the atmosphere of Miller's novels.As I said before  Sin City is not for everyone- but if you can handle violence ( and I mean violence ) then this is a movie not to be missed.\tUpon viewing this movie I have to say it left me totally baffled. Why is pointless excessive violence so popular?? This movie does not answer  but rather prompts such questions. I am not a fan of violence. I cant see the point in glorifying humans doing ugly things to each other. Prior to checking out this movie I did not realise that Tarantino had a guest spot  otherwise even the opportunity to see Josh in action would not have enticed me into the theatre to sit through multiple depictions of (in my opinion) seemingly endless and senseless butchery. I could appreciate the clever visual design and artistic styling of the movie - and lariat wielding Jessica is stunning  but Frodo \""How could you?\""\tThis is the film that i had been waiting for. Rarely has there ever been a film where i was knocked out of my seat from the ball busting attitude of a film. Right from the first second of film I felt i would leave a happy person. The heavy black and white cinematography  the intense colour work  the awesome acting from everyone  every bit of this is flawless in my eyes.Many have said this is sexiest against women  but the whole time the women were on I thought i wouldn't want to mess with them. This is really empowering for the women. As they said  the women are the law  and you wouldn't want to cross them; especially Miho.All the guys are tough and forceful. Marv going on a relentless massacre for a woman he loved is the best tragic love story i have every seen in film. But all the stories are tragic love stories in one way.A thought about the violence in Sin City. If this was in colour  the violence would have been so much more disturbing. Though this is a violent movie  it is very stylized; so the impact is dulled down that your not always registering the violence.In all  this is Robert Rodriguez's best work. This film will never date and be as strong in 20 to 50 years time.\tA black-and-white  ultra-violent film based on a comic book  directed by Robert Rodriguez  Frank Miller (the creator of the comics) and a special guest director Quentin Tarantino. It has to be cool! And it is. I was so happy after seeing \""Sin City\"" that I decided to make a list of things I liked about this film: 1. The dialog is brilliant; 2. Although the characters say clever things almost without a break (and during the breaks we can enjoy their interesting thoughts)  the action never stops either. There is always a good chance for a bullet  a car or a maniac to appear; 3. The laws of physics are the same as in comics - the cars take curves and make jumps wickedly; 4. Blood fountains appear to the places where used to be a leg or an arm - just like in \""Kill Bill\""; 5. Like in \""Schindler's List\""  some things are in colour: the red dress of a woman in the opening scene  the yellow face of Yellow Bastard etc; 6. Some characters never talk but they have other good qualities as shooting arrows or throwing swastika blades to kill people  or cannibalism; 7. The characters are shot  their arms and legs are ripped off  they are ran over by car  punched with hard fists... but they stay alive and fight back for a long time before dying; 8. All the bad guys get punished. Hard; 9. There is always night in Sin City; 10. It's hard to find a character in the film who is normal; 11. Elijah Wood plays a quiet boy who has long nails and cool sunglasses and who eats people. Slightly different from Frodo of \""The Lord of the Rings\""... 12. Michael Clarke Duncan plays a cop who tries to waste the prostitutes; 13. The prostitutes are pretty. They also use wicked weapons to protect themselves against the cops who try to waste them... 14. Josh Hartnett from the \""masterpieces\"" \""Pearl Harbour\"" and \""40 Days and 40 Nights\"" plays in this film. And this time he's a bad guy; 15. Tarantino directed a scene where a man with his throat cut talks... There are many more good things about this film. Rodriguez has given us \""Desperado\"" and \""From Dusk Till Dawn\""  Tarantino \""Reservoir Dogs\"" and \""Pulp Fiction\"". \""Sin City\"" is a new gift from them  Frank Miller and a punch of great actors. We should thank them all...\tSin City was an awe inspiring cinematic event. Never have I see such an effective meld of story  acting  genre and film in one delicious package. For me there were no stand out performances as all the cast seemed to melt into their roles and the dark scenery behind them......though saying that Mickey Rourke and Rosario Dawson were excellent (I gotta stop pratting on) It is interesting to note that some of the cast who were in the same scenes together actually didn't film them together and never met.In the old clich\u00e9 'if you are going to see one movie this year....this should be the one!'\tBefore I saw the first trailers that had leaked out on the net  I didn't know about the Sin City graphic novels at all. But  simply by watching that trailer  my expectations became very high right away. I sometimes watched the trailer for fun  simply because it was so good  and promised so much. The other trailers that were official  promised even more. I've never waited so much for a movie since I waited for Kill Bill.Did it keep its promise? It did  and more. The visual style was absolutely fantastic  with the movie being completely in black and white with splashes of colour here and there  such as a red dress  the flashing lights of the police cars or Bledel's blue eyes. The story lines were simple and straightforward. Some have called the movie shallow  and I suppose it was  but for some reason this is not bad in any way.We're sent into Sin City for two hours and we get to see a different world  a world real and unreal... and it feels good! It's easy getting sucked into this strange parallel universe  where you can find anything. It's dark and exciting. It's a place where the men are raw and hard characters  and the women are cool and always beautiful. It's decades ago and it's today.The acting was good. I didn't expect anything else with such an impressive list of excellent actors/actresses. Here are some of them  and what I thought about them: Jessica Alba is Nancy Callahan  a stripper at the Kadie's bar. Alba is doing a pretty good job  actually. Just about good enough for this role  but not any more than that  in my opinion.Devon Aoki is Miho  one of the girls of Old Town. I don't think she says anything at all in the movie. Hard to say much about the acting  but it looked like she did her job.Alexis Bledel is Becky  one of the youngest of the Old Town prostitutes. I have to admit I was curious to see Bledel in such a movie  after seeing her as Rory in Gilmore Girls. Except for a few weak moments here and there  she did a great job on the whole.Rosario Dawson is Gail  one of the de facto leader figures of Old Town. I love the way Dawson did this character. Gotta love her mischievous smile.Benicio Del Toro is Jackie Boy  a no good cop. del Toro must be some sort of acting genius. He is one of the outstanding actors in this movie  he is really  *really* good as Jackie Boy  even when Jackie is supposed to be dead.Rutger Hauer is Cardinal Roark. Another small role in this movie. Even so  he's doing a great job.Jaime King is Goldie/Wendy  twin sisters and prostitutes of Old Town. This is  as far as I remember (and I'm very sure) the first time I get to see her work. I think that her sensuality is created where her hotness and cool intersect.Brittany Murphy is Shellie  a bar maid at Kadie's. Here is another one who does her job incredibly well. For a while we have Murphy and del Toro in the same scenes; a real treat. Murphy's facial expressions  gesturing  the way she delivers her lines - just sit back and enjoy. Ace performance by Murphy.Mickey Rourke is Marv. Great character who beats his way through Sin City with fury and humour in order to find vengeance on whoever murdered Goldie. Rourke does it well.Nick Stahl is Roark Jr./Yellow Bastard. A pedophile who is after Nancy  and after Hartigan saves her  he attempts to kill him. I'm not familiar with Stahl's previous works  I believe  but he certainly seems to play this part well.Bruce Willis is Hartigan  a good cop. I recently saw Die Hard  and remembering Armageddon I have to say he doesn't seem to have a terribly wide range as an actor  but then again his roles usually doesn't seem to give much room either. For such parts  including the one as Hartigan  he's a good choice.Elijah Wood is Kevin  one of the more terrifying characters. No lines for Wood  and it's not much he needs to do  I guess  except staring without expression  or trying to fight Marv.It may sound like I'm raving about all the actors  but I hope it's also clear that in some cases I can't say much about the acting  and that in some cases it's great  sometimes good and sometimes weak.Anyway  I loved this movie. Unfortunately it was pulled from the big screen in my city after only a month  and by that time I've seen it only four times. I'll just need to get the DVD...This is an easy 10/10.\tWhat can i write that hasn't been written before already? This movie rocks! Forget Spiderman and Batman  this is what a comic-turned-movie should look like. It's kind of like the visual style of \""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\"" and the violent plot and fast pace of \""Kill Bill\""  with a 3 part story like \""Pulp Fiction\"" or \""Go\"".Violence plays a very big part in \""Sin City\"". There's stabbing  shooting  decapitations  the electric chair  castration  gang-style executions.. it's all in there so don't say i didn't warn you. But it's all so raw  so gruesome and so way over-the-top  that it actually becomes funny again.Recommended  provided you are willing to see the violence for the mockery that it is.\t...I think that maybe I have seen too many movies in this vein and style  or I have been privy to too much in the realm of dark  violent  and intriguing noir stories  but there's just something about Sin City that doesn't quite make it a masterpiece  at least for me. I wouldn't dare tell you to not see the film  especially if you're in its target area (if you look at the IMDb votes  the primary 10's are given by those under the age of 18  or 18-29  mostly males)  and for auteur Robert Rodgriguez (his number of credits practically solidifies him as one)  he has here achieved a different style that stands out pretty well in today's muck of Hollywood films. What can be criticized  I think  is with Frank Miller  who is more of the brain  brawn's  and flaws of Sin City as writer/co-director of the film  and originator of the comic books this film is practically copied and pasted by. I have read a couple of the Sin City comics  and I have no doubt that Miller is a gifted artist. But as a storyteller  he's hit or miss for me. Not that I am unaware of what goes into these noir stories- there's the consummate anti-heroes (haunted cops  big tough guys with a heart)  the strong femme fatales  and the twisted  corrupt villains. Yet even in the best parts of Sin City there's something  well  too expectable. Not to say the actors don't do what they can or there's not enough juice in it. But at times I felt Rodriguez  through Miller  was so faithful to the original text (he called it a 'translation' as opposed to an adaptation)  some of the real interesting parts were left behind. There is something in Rodriguez/Miller that speaks of talent and strength  but also total dependence on standards in the genre(s).There is no question that the content in the film is rather graphic and surreal in the violence (the ripping off of various body-parts  blood sometimes red or b&w or yellow)  and on the visceral level I mentioned it serves the brutality of the stories. Take Elijah Wood's character  Kevin  whom he plays with perfect stone-cold  calm insanity. He is likely the most violent character in the film (Marv is violent  though mostly by defense)  even if we don't see him committing these violent acts. Scenes involving him and Marv (Mickey Rourke  also one of the highlights of the film) are well shot  but somehow I felt a kind of by-the-numbers quality as well. It's strange to say it  and many will not feel the same way (many have commented on the film's brazen originality  which I do and don't see)  there is something about the film that tries so much (and maybe too hard) to be easily liked.Rodriguez  in keeping with a very similar storytelling style of his friend Quentin Tarantino  is confident  but because it's a familiar style  "
Sky High (2005),"Was it clich\u00e9d? Yes. Was it silly? Yes. Was it filled with mid an late eighties dance music? Oddly  yes.Did I and my kids enjoy it? Most definitely! In general if Kurt Russell is in a movie  I avoid it like the plague. However  in this case  I'm glad the 3 and 5 year old wanted to go. It was an enjoyable way to spend a hot summer afternoon. The special effects were well done  and not overdone. The violence was cartoonish enough not to upset the kiddies. It's the first time that my 3 year old has sat still for an entire movie. It was also the first Kurt Russell movie that didn't make me want to vomit.Definitely two thumbs up! I would see it again.BTW  Linda Carter still is hot.\tImagine if your parents were two powerful superheroes  what impact it would have on your own life. That's what 14 year old Will Stronghold has to answer. His parents are Steve and Josie Stronghold  they are known real estate agents  but when the world is in danger  they become The Commander who is as strong as a dozen men. Jetstream who can fly at supersonic speed. Beginning of a new school year  and Will is starting at Sky High. A school that trains and teaches superheroes to be. But Will is not sure he has super powers  and may get labeled as a side kick. Can Will rise above that  and become the hero he was meant to be? I enjoyed the awesome effects  and the action  and the actors. It also had great humor. To viewers if you enjoyed Spy Kids and The Incredibles then you will love Sky High.\tI really loved this movie  I don't know why  but it's great. I recommend all teens and kids see it!!!! Adults will probably like it to they find it cute. There was action  happy ending  comedy and it was really great! The affects were a little less fantastic then you would see in Star Wars or Harry Potter  but the story line was great. I can't really say anything bad about the movie. It could have had a little more action and a little less easy jokes  but in general it was great. It also gets a little boring at times  and the plot is a little obvious and sometimes some of the characters need a little more of a role  but otherwise I would definitely see this movie again!!!\tI only saw the last bit of the movie. I thought it was okay. The story was one of those typical Disney Channel super hero movies. There is a villain and some heroes that get whooped and a little boy comes to save them (main character) and blah blah blah. Special effects could have been improved since most of the movie is about flying! Acting was nothing spectacular but the main ladies were sort of cute. I was still surprised though. I expected the movie to be horrible beyond words. But I was happily proved wrong! It's most definitely NOT an adults movie unless you are taking your children. It isn't boring  I'll say that  but it isn't anything for the books. Don't expect much  but don't expect nothing either!!\tSky High is a fine family film. My wife  my little and I enjoyed it. The actors played it straight with outrageous circumstances. That low key humor made it work well.Themes  conflicts developed and evolve through the film. They will be resolved in a very satisfying way. Recommend you see it on the big screen. Effects are fun. Often way bigger than life - which is appropriate for a super hero school.Strong parallels to average high school trials. Characters are diverse  and interesting. The story keeps your attention.Enough said - don't wait for VHS & DVD  catch it on the large screen!\tI went to the theatres to see this movie with very low expectations. The movie wasn't as bad as I was led to believe. It was actually funny. People in my theatres laughed a lot. The storyline was cool and it wasn't a ripoff of \the incredibles\"". It was original and entertaining. It's a fun storyline for kids and the young at heart. I'm sure people would have accepted it better if it was in animation. It was about a kid growing up in a family of the planet's biggest superheroes with him been a late bloomer. They also managed to sneak in a little love story. Something you've seen in high school type movies but this one has a little difference. I'm pretty sure it would be enjoyable if it is given a chance.I would advice people to see it if you want to be entertained. And kids will love it. I give it a 7.\tI saw the ads for this and thought it would be so lame  but I was desperate to take my five year-old to a movie so there we went. It was great. It borrowed heavily from other movies like \""The Incredibles\"" and the Harry Potter films  but at the same time did not do the total \""formula\"" with the characters that I expected based on the commercials. If you don't go to the theatres to see this one  it is a definite for rental (should be out by Halloween knowing Hollywood). For all you guys who think Kelly Preston is a MILF  there is a quick scene in the first few minutes that will make it worth the price of a ticket. Kurt Russell really would have benefited from better makeup and lighting but luckily he didn't get much screen time.\tYes  this was a good movie. Did I like it? Yes. Did I laugh? Of course. Then again  you can't go wrong with Kurt Russell aka  Snake Plisskin. By the way  if you pay close attention  you can see an ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK poster on the kid's room. Must be an HOMAGE to the character  Snake Plissken. Kurt is so great. He is the COMMANDER. The Commander has super strong muscles and is very intense when it comes to the dream he has of being head of the SUPER FAMILY. The kid is OK  he was better in that skateboard movie. However  he delivers a few goods. Of course  that girl who plays ROYAL PAIN delivers a good or two. But not much more than that. My friend Jake  stays awake at night  trying to come up with a good superpower. But He already has a superpower  he is super into working out. Tedd  who has a wife that is expecting a baby  might very well like this movie. Go see it Tedd  if you can get out from under that THUNDERSTORM!!\ti enjoyed this movie a lot. i thought all the principle actors did a great job. Kurt Russel was of course great as always. he came off as a great super hero and a good dad as well. Bruce Campbell was pretty funny as coach boomer. the thing that really impressed me was the character arc of warren peace. in the beginning you think that he night be a villain but he turns out to be a good guy. more of a anti hero type. the \""save the citizen scene was also quite good. the audience i saw it with applauded. i love super hero movies so to me it was refreshing putting an adolescent spin on this genre. i also was amazed at how many different powers they came up with. so over all this was a really cool movie.\tHere is a question. The movie is set in a high school  what are the chances that you will see someone locked in a locker? There are two girls  one is hot and on is your friend. Of course  I knew which one he will end up with  but I did not not know it will happen that quickly and that trivially.Do you generally feel an incredible suspense when a movie character is trying to cut a wire in order to prevent some type of a disaster and does not really now which wire to cut? If yes you may actually enjoy this movie.Maybe school cafeteria scenes  in which the main character chooses to sit at a table with cool guys and not at the table with his friends  break your heart? Then go and watch this movie.It is just plain flat. You can pretty much predict what happens next. The main character is a teenager whose parents are superheros  but he lacks any superpowers  or I should say  does not know his superpowers. In movies like that  you know right away that he should discover some of those eventually  but usually one should expect some sort of struggle  some twist  or other surprise that would give him those powers. In \""Sky High\"" it is simply banal - he just gets them. Well... I am sorry  to be exact I should say (not without an irony) that he actually does have to fight to get them. Worst part is there is almost absolutely no humor other that you hear in a typical kid's TV comedy shows. The only thing close to being funny was the girlfriend's father remark about the guy with six arms. I was surprised to see so many comments praising this rather mediocre picture. I can suggest one simple game you can play when reading the comments of the people who gave this movie 9 or 10. Can you tell which ones are truly sincere and which ones are written by promoters? Which ones do you think are written by professional writers?I usually give mediocre pictures a mediocre vote  but I gave 1 to this one since it is really the top of mediocrity.\tIt's been some time since I was in high school but I don't think any us of totally forget what it was like to have to deal with cliques- especially when the school encouraged them!I won't repeat what others have said but I liked how Captain Stronghold and Jetstream played good Cleaver 'rents who expected a great deal from their son but were by no means total tyrants. Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston played the roles with just the right amount of broadness and heart. I thought it was funny how as soon Will told them that the unauthorized party wasn't his idea  they shrugged it off. And did anyone else laugh out loud at the fact that the 'cool' teens went to the trouble to commandeer the house behind parents' backs for a BIG party yet they didn't bring any refreshments stronger than soda?! ONLY in a Disney movie!Also  I liked how they added interesting touches such as Warren being able to speak Chinese fluently (even though this had absolutely nothing to do with the main plot) . Or how when the 'civilian' couple saw a teen perform a feat of strength that would have taken Supe himself aback  it was the husband who fainted and wouldn't anyone else like to have the number of their roofer/house builder who constructed the house and roof sturdy enough to withstand thousands of extra tons in one spot? Oh  and a shout out to Cloris Leachman for playing the school nurse who was SO much like my childhood pediatrician- right down to her white pigtails  candy and medical explanations!Not rocket science or anything deep but it was fun and I was ready for the laughs!\tSKY HIGH (2005) *** Kurt Russell  Kelly Preston  Michael Angarano  Danielle Panabaker  Mary Elizabeth Winstead  Dee Jay Daniels  Kelly Vitz  Nicholas Braun  Malika Khadijah  Jake Sanvig  Will Harris  Kevin Heffernan  Lynda Carter  Bruce Campbell  Steven Strait  Cloris Leachman  Dave Foley  Kevin McDonald (voice of Patrick Warburton) Not so \""Incredibles\"" but fairly \""Fantastic\""Just when we think we have seen our fill of comic book heros being adapted to the silver screen comes an out-of-nowhere sleeper of the summer that is amiable enough to make a mark for some originality. The premise is simple \u0096 teenagers who have super powers from super hero parents are sent to the top secret Sky High  a high school literally stationed in the clouds thousands of miles out of sight (and sustained by an anti-gravitational system in perpetual motion to avoid any villains taking potshots at the progenies there)  where they are assigned duties as either Hero or Sidekick. Will Stronghold (Angarano) is the son of superhero parents The Commander (Russell having a field day here) and JetStream (Preston having some fun as well) AKA Steve and Josie Stronghold  realtors by day and saving the world by night  who can't seem to find his super powers despite the first day jitters with his best friend Layla (Panabaker)  the cute girl who can control all plant life (like Aquaman can with fish)  and harbors a secret crush for her buddy. There they meet a few other new friends including Magenta (hottie Vitz)  a purple clad punk who can transmogrify into a guinea pig; Ethan (Daniels) who can melt into a puddle; Zach (Braun recalling some Michael Richards and Jim Carrey physical shtick) who can glow like a fluorescent night stick; and Gwen (Winstead exuding girl-next-door purity)  a love interest for Will who is an expert with technology.All are faced with being assigned as either a Hero or a Sidekick by the no-nonsense jerk Coach Boomer AKA SonicBoom (square jawed cult hero Campbell eating up the scenery with glee) humiliating Will who can't summon his gifts and is reduced with most of his new buddies as Sidekicks where they are schooled by Mr. Boy and Mr. Medulla (\""Kids In The Hall\"" alums Foley and McDonald  respectively)  the former a former sidekick to The Commander (who doesn't recall him) and the latter a mad scientist type with a huge noggin as a throwback to the sci-fi flicks of the '50s. What makes the film somewhat refreshing is that it is a mix of kitschy comic book stylings with adolescent angst and the pitfalls they endure as teens all done with cheeky aplomb and surprisingly keen observations to how teens interact with one another and more importantly their parents. Russell  who cut his baby teeth on Disney flicks (which this film is a product of by the way)  with his wide cut jawline  high cheek bones  dimple and kiss-curl pompadour is perfect casting as an old-school superhero (replete with cheesy costume) and Preston actually seems energized for a change than her usual dishwater logged turns lately  as the parents are a match made in heaven  with equal parts humor (I laughed out loud when Russell  in a fit of anger  demolishes a cel phone  only to open the kitchen drawer and retrieving a new one from a dozen standing by in just that case of circumstance) and know-how ingenuity (when the villain Royal Pain is finally revealed it is shrewdly alluded to earlier in a subtle line of dialogue). It's also nice to see the shapely  remarkably well-preserved Carter as the high school's principal who actually says at one point  \""I'm not Wonder Woman  you know?\""What makes the film fun is the kids enjoying themselves largely thanks to the breezy direction by Mike Mitchell and a smartly funny screenplay by Paul Hernandez  Robert Schooley and Mark McCorkle (the latter duo of the animated TV series  \""Kim Possible\"") and the kooky production design by Bruce Robert Hill and the aforementioned colorful costumes by Michael Wilkinson (sort of Nickelodeon meets DC Comics) all not taking itself too seriously and plainly a guilty pleasure not since last year's benchmark animated fare \""The Incredibles\""  which this inevitably is being stacked against; apples and oranges \u0096 both are ultimately fantastic family fare. It beats \""The Fantastic Four\"" for what that film lacks  whimsy and heart.\tSky High is a terrific movie for the 9-13 age group  but anyone can really enjoy it. For a Disney movie  it has fairly good acting and a great concept. Older children may not go for the action parts (it is very unrealistic  though the special effects are excellent)  but a love story that captures the feelings of high school is entwined in the story. It was several funny lines  but it is mostly just good fun for younger kids. The actors are around the right age  so it really makes it seem realistic. It's a cute movie that pretty much needs to be seen. I would highly recommend Sky High to anyone who is looking to have a fun time at the movies!\tShy High might have been purposed for little kids  but like most good Disney movies(and only the really good ones)there are different levels of comedy. It was not necessarily the lines which made it great  but the actors who were saying them. There was also a lot of situational comedy  which I will not disclose  but there were times that I was laughing quite loudly through entire scenes. It was almost uncanny how accurate Sky High was to any other high school  just add super powers to the mix. All in all in was an extremely entertaining movie and the moment it was over my sister turned to me (she is in college) and said  \""As soon as this comes out on DVD I am buying it!\"" It was hilariously fun  full of laughs and it actually had a good moral lesson. Go see it  you will love it  I promise! ;) Note: The reason why I did not give it a 10 was because I do not believe any movie is perfect. So 9 in my book is amazingly awesome!\tLet me begin by saying that I went to this movie with very low expectations. I only went because my little brother wanted to get out of the house. Now  I'm so glad I did.As a senior in high school  I expected to groan through a movie of the same calibur as power rangers. I was pleasantly surprised! There were of course some campy elements  such as the obvious villain and the villain's look  but otherwise  it was cleverly written  had some original lines and ideas as well as a very accurate view of high school (I especially liked the cafeteria scenes.) In short  go to this movie. It's clever  fun  and not what you'd expect.\tSky High inhabits that sort of murky area of a being a spoof and a straightforward story at the same time  a la Galaxy Quest. Though lacking the genius of that film  Sky High nonetheless carves out similar territory.You've discerned the pitch from the trailers: Will (Michael Angarano  frighteningly resembling a teenaged Brian Wilson) is the son of the two greatest superheroes on the planet  The Commander (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream (Kelly Preston). He's headed for enrollment at Sky High  a special school which caters to the children of super-powered people. The dilemma: Will has no powers to speak of  so while everyone expects a great deal of him given his parentage  he has nothing to show for it.Of course this being a Disney film  Will has a pining best friend  Layla (Danielle Panabaker) and a coterie of nerds who stay loyal to him up until the point he becomes popular (teen movie plot #4). There's also the 'hot' girl  Gwen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead)  who of course becomes involved with the son of the world's greatest heroes.The first half of the film \u0096well  no  most of it  really \u0096 is ripped straight from Harry Potter. The kids are from a special lineage. They go to a special school for people with neat powers  driven there on a special bus. There are bullies; the hero is put upon by expectations of him; he must prove himself against a jerk out to get him. There's even a sorting hat  in the person of Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell)  who decides whether the new kids will be hero or sidekick. My favorite of the oddball faculty was Mr. Boy (Dave Foley  perfectly cast)  the sidekick or 'hero support' teacher.Sky High is fun despite its obvious borrowing; Russell in particular is enjoyable as the dad who never quite grew up  an amalgam of Superman and Batman and an eternal teenager. Preston makes less of an impression but has a few good scenes  mostly when sparring verbally with Russell. Angarano is fine as Will; he's not charismatic enough to carry the film  but with all the eye-popping super-hero visuals and an interesting enough supporting cast  he's fine. The big surprise for me was a character named Warren Peace (Steven Strait)  a semi-bully who ends up having surprising depth.There are some good chuckles in the film and it's a fun diversion  pretty harmless  but not up to what I expected given that the geniuses who create Kim Possible \u0096 Robert Schooley and Mark McCorkle \u0096 were the primary writers on this. It's cute throughout and clever in spots  but a tad predictable  and the similarity to Harry Potter pops up so often you almost wonder if J.K. Rowling will sue (not that she needs the money). I enjoyed the movie  but you could easily wait for a DVD rental on this one. Light fun  a bit of fluff  better than most of the kiddie fare out there at the moment  but nothing earth-shattering. I'd rather they go back to working on the far-superior Kim Possible  myself.\t***May contain spoilers*** Quick Plot: In a world where super-powered humans exists  Will is the son the the greatest super-hero couple  The Commander and Jetstream. Children of superpowered parents are sent to an exclusive school called Sky High in order to train them to use their super powers. The movie follows Will as he encounters various obstacles while trying to live up to the standards of his famous parents.Basically this movie is a stereotypical \""teenagers in high school\"" movie combined with a superhero plot. It has all the standard elements of a teenage movie: dorky male character  female friend who really loves him  group of nerdy misfits that save the day  high school \""tough guy\""  high school bullies  prom night dance  attractive teenage girl that is desired by all the guys  etc However  the formula works with the superhero aspect added and combine to create a fun  entertaining movie. The special effects for the super powers really blend in well and the actors all do a great job (both adult and teenagers alike). The pacing was good and the flow of the movie went well.A downside though  is that the movie was pretty predictable  at least for me anyway. I was already figuring the identity and plan of the villain long before it was shown in the movie. But that's just me.Overall  this was a thoroughly \""fun\"" movie and good for all ages. This movie isn't going to change your life  bring about world peace or be titled \""Best Movie Ever\""  but it is a fun movie to watch and entertain.I definitely recommend this movie. I give it a 7.5 out of 10.\tMy husband and I were dreading a visit to theater to see Sky High with our six year-old daughter. We were so mistaken! The film was really very enjoyable. Funny  smart  visually interesting and just plain good. We were all laughing  as were the other parents around us. The actors were very witty and capable. The script was great. The set and special effects was first rate. I usually enjoy going to the girly Disney movies (Princess Diaries  etc.) but I walked into this film with a bit of a bad attitude  convinced the superhero plot wouldn't cut it. I was so wrong.The commercial doesn't do the film any justice  it was really a very cute film that I won't even mind viewing ad nauseum when it comes out on DVD.\tI was stuck in a theatre with at least 3 elementry school classes  all of whom found the basics of the film to be very entertaining. But for those of us who want to see something a little more grown up- WATCH THIS MOVIE FOR WARREN PEACE. Played by former model Steven Strait his presence lights up the screen  and I would even go as far as to say he steals the movie. And during scenes where his mature looks are meant to contrast the otherwise silliness of the moment you can tell that he has a future as the next great film star. So for the movie as a whole I would give it a 5 (good enough for kids a and good enough to see more then once without getting bored.) but for Warren i give a 10 which averages out to an 8.\tThis was a decent lighthearted movie  relatively fast paced  so one can simply have a good time without noticing the movie shortcomings.But the studio plants really really need to cool it down. I mean it is getting to the point where it is becoming useless to read IMDb reviews of newly released movies.I understand an occasional person giving this movie a 9  maybe someone who has not been to the movies in the past 10 years can be excused for giving it a 10  but realistically for the movie that has a bunch of meaningless lighthearted laughs going for it at best  5-6 rating should be absolute top. I've been reading IMDb for many years and I remember the time when the rating system was still useful  and comments at least seemed sincere.IMDb needs to do something about it. Well  there are always trusted critics to turn to  and their reviews are available on the internet  so people will always be able to find unbiased info about new releases  and hopefully studios are burning more money in planting these comments on IMDb than they are getting in extra ticket sales. And then MPAA has the heart to complain about piracy?"""
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005),"Seeing this movie reminds me of the saying 'You can't kick a bark out of a dead dog.' That being said  this movie seems so forced in its attempts to be everything to everyone that it doesn't achieve any one particular aspect very well. The drama presented between characters is oddly placed when thinking of what kind of care they movie attempts to make you have for them. Basically  the character interaction is stagnant  with some contractually obligated hints at Anakin's angst or whatever  until such time as the obvious crescendo is is reached and signals another stagnant character interaction. There is nothing that makes you care what happens between Anakin and the ex-Queens relationship  save for an excuse to fart out some of the most forced and/or disinterested acting in Hollywood... and that says a lot. Normally that wouldn't directly make a movie abysmally bad if it has action or other redeeming entertainment value (like special effects)  but all the pomp in this film cannot save it from the commitment the movie requires you to invest. It's long  long and cheesy. The movies cares little to present Anakins inner turmoil  and if it gives reason for it  it doesn't bother to make it a focal point. If an audience isn't made to care about the characters inner developments  then how are they supposed to care about the clich\u00e9 twists and turns it attempts to make? If you don't care about the characters  something the original trilogy succeeded in  you aren't going to care when Padame has twins in a minute and spits out both their names in the same breath. What? Why'd she pick those names? Was she looking for the first thing that came to her head? WHy didn't Lucas have enough sense to foreshadow an influence for her name ideas. All this would seem moot if the scene wasn't supposed to be so important in the entire saga. ANakin  as well is presented as a plastic 2 dimensional character  and I say 2 dimensional  because the film tries to fart out a sorry excuse of struggle of good and evil within him which basically consists in him saying the appropriate lines to tell us which side he is leaning on at the moment. Rubbish! And when he converts he is reduced to the one dimensional archetype tattered super-villain we have all seen before. The only relation I had with this film was when Vader gets off his operation table and shouts in the worst and most unconvincing 'NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO' I have seen in a film since your favorite Ed Wood film  and the reason for this connection is that that is what i was screaming in my head during this entire picture. I wasn't expecting much in the first place. The first two prequels were horrible  with an amusing battle scene at the end of part II  but this film is exactly what Star Wars film shouldn't be - Star Trek parading around as Star Wars.I think  with all sincerity  that Lucas' new Star Wars 'vision' (starting with his hacking the originals with horrible cabaret scenes and needless animations) is the product of a mid-life crisis. It is not his fault that the best STar Wars film wasn't directed by him (Empire Strikes Back)  but there is no reason for garbage like this save for lining your pockets with the money of nostalgic Star Wars fans and their kids. And although  i have a fondness for the originals  and i have that nostalgia too  I am glad I didn't get suckered into paying 7 bucks for this trash. I downloaded it off the internet. Lucas is not an artist  but a capitalist.\tWith the release of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith  George Lucas has brought his epic space saga to a close  and to what I would imagine is the relief of fans everywhere  he takes it out on a high note. Revenge of the Sith  is  by far  the strongest of the three prequel films Lucas began releasing in 1999.Revenge of the Sith still exhibits many of the weaknesses of his previous two entries: questionable dialog  some occasionally silly scenes and performances that don't always show the actors in their best light. But this is all trivial compared to the good aspects of Revenge of the Sith: engaging action sequences  outstanding visual effects and the most involving dramatic moments featured in a Star Wars film.As the film opens  the Galactic Republic is still in the throes of war with separatists that began at the conclusion of the previous film. We are treated to an breathtaking extended action sequence that features Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) attempting to rescue the Galactic Republic's Chancellor  Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid)  from the clutches of Sith Lord Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and the robot army leader  General Grevious (voiced by Matthew Woods). After the success of the mission  Anakin is reunited with his secret wife  Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman)  who reveals she is pregnant with his child. Plagued by dreams of Padme's death during childbirth  Anakin finds himself more and more susceptible Palpatine's insinuations of learning the power available to one from the Dark Side of the Force. When a critical juncture is reached during the war  the Jedi  not trusting Palpatine's motives  decide to seize the Republic from him  with dire results. Palpatine then convinces Anakin to become his apprentice  with the reward being learning a method to save Padme from death  and so he takes the name Darth Vader. Palpatine then sends him on a mission to wipe out the remaining Jedi and bring the war to a close  while Palpatine manipulates the Galactic Senate into becoming the Galactic Empire under his rule.Most of the details of the plot are familiar to anyone who is fan of the original trilogy  so the outcome of the events of this film are hardly a surprise. However  George Lucas imbues the film with a stronger element of drama than any previous entry in the series. There is some powerful  emotional material on display here  intertwining the fates of various characters in a complex web of deceit and betrayal. Especially moving is the plight of Anakin Skywalker. His character is so desperate to keep everyone that he loves that he actually causes the very things he fears by holding on too tight and making questionable choices. More than any character in the Star Wars saga  Anakin is a decidedly tragic figure  and you cannot help but feel a strong sense of pathos for him as the film progresses.Lucas also delves into the nature of a totalitarian regime and how it can spring up  rather unforeseeable  from a strong and virile democracy. For the first time in the Star Wars movies  Revenge of the Sith also introduces some shades of grey into the conflict between good and evil  where previously everything had been depicted in black and white. The Jedi are presented almost borderline arrogant  sure of their passionless approach to the universe  while the Sith seem to embrace the affections of others. That does not necessarily change the conflict  the Sith are still evil  the Jedi good  but how Anakin perceives the situation is what gives the new nuances some strength.Of course  a Star Wars film wouldn't be a Star Wars film without some serious eye-candy  and Revenge of the Sith delivers in spades. The elaborate opening space battle is impressive  the screen filled to bursting with visual information. There are several digital characters in the film  the most interesting being General Grevious. He is a mix of machine and living being  and he is no less a character than any flesh and blood actor featured in the film. Yoda returns to the digital fold again after first being rendered with ones and zeroes for Episode II  and again he holds up just as well as the puppet of old.We are also treated to several elaborate action set-pieces  the strongest being the climactic lightsaber duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan. The battle unfolds on the surface of a molten lava planet named Mustafar  and setting is appropriate for Anakin's decent into his own personal hell. The battle on Mustafar is intercut with a similar duel between Yoda and Palpatine in the Galactic Senate chamber  and both hold our attention without fail.If Episode III has a weakness  it's the acting and dialogue. While most of the performers do a serviceable job  at times they falter  struggling with clunky dialogue. That being said  Episode III does feature at least one standout performance  that of Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine. Delivering what I think is strongest performance to date in any Star Wars film  McDiarmid shines as Palpatine moves his plans from the background to the forefront. Ewan McGregor brings some levity to the proceedings with his jovial performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi  but is serious when necessary. Hayden Christensen brings his work up a notch from Episode II with the darker  more serious Anakin. While he is saddled with some of the worst dialogue  he still manages it well.And so  after better than 20 years  the book is finally (theoretically) closed on Star Wars. I  for one  was glad to be there for the ride  and happy to see it go out on a strong note. May the Force be with you.\tI've noticed that women in general liked the movie more than men. I think women liked that there was more of a love story in there than the other ones. I also thought it was a great movie  however it can not surpass the IV V and VI. It was also much better than I and II. The first one was horrible and the second was good but didn't give me the feeling of \Star Wars\"". There wasn't any Jedi on Sith action and that doesn't feel like \""Star Wars.\"" That's why this one was so good  it had those epic fights they wanted to put in the episode II but it still had the saber fights and lots of them. The two trilogies were connected by III and it was nice to see some familiar faces.\tLooking at this film and the first trilogy you can't help notice a simplicity about the first three and also how the first three where more human.This film gets much closer to the originals whilst still suffering from some of the over blown elements of the first two films. Going darker was a good move  it adds more weight to a series that originally was based upon the feel of a Saturday morning western.The best of the first three films by far  not up to the strength of the main 'star wars' film  it has to be said  even with all the special effect.\tThe Phantom Menace was okay  I loved Jar-Jar but he did get annoying. Attack of the Clones was wonderful though sometimes the love story was cheesy. But Now Revenge of the Sith is by far the best of the prequels. Excellent visual effects. I'm just sick and tired of people giving crap about Count Dooku being killed off early. Obviously Lucas has his reasons. Ewan did and excellent job with his role. He does a fantastic job setting up Guiness in A New Hope. I felt sorry for poor Natalie  there wasn't much she could do with her role except stay at home patting her pregnant belly  praying that Anakin was alright. But all in all she did an acceptable job. She's done well in the past with the Star Wars prequels. Ah  and finally Anakin has moved on from being the whiny teenager to a more mature. Hayden did a great job making the transition to the more mature  darker side of Anakin.I didn't find many questionable parts. Lucas made a good tie in with the Original Trtilogy. Though I was a little surprised about Anakin's turn to the dark side for Padme. The fight scenes with Ewan and Hayden and Yoda and Sidious were well choreographed. It was great movie.\tYes this is the best of the three prequels. The special effects are as dazzling as ever and this time there is more story. The problem however  is the major plot holes. If you are not a big star wars fan  you may not notice but Luke and Leia's mother died instantly after she gave birth. In Return of the Jedi  Princess Leia talks to Luke about the memory of her mother  her \""real\"" mother. I've heard other people say that in the new DVD versions of Star Wars  Lucas edited out this dialog. I don't know if that's true but if it is  its a lazy attempt to tie the original story together. After dwelling on this  I realized that this plot hole is not nearly as bad as the one in the original trilogy. Luke and Leia have a passionate kiss in Empire Strikes back and then we learn that they are brother and sister. Leia confronts this fact by saying \""somehow....I've always known.\"" Well maybe long ago in a galaxy far far away  people were not ashamed to have deep kisses with their siblings but that strikes me as a little odd. Also  what's the deal with R2D2's flying capability? This did not happen in IV  V or VI. Did he forget he could fly when Captain Antilles wiped away their memories? Well  I guess for the average popcorn-blockbuster-movie-fanatic this does not make much difference. it would not surprise me if one day  Lucas decided to re release all the movies in theaters with added scenes and all new plot twists that will continue to distort our imaginations of the story.\tGeorge Lucas originally created Star Wars: A New Hope in 1977  which was originally intended to stand alone  and when he later created the two sequels \""The Empire Strikes Back\"" and \""The Return of the Jedi \"" the theme of the saga was that of an intergalactic war. With the creation of episodes I (The Phantom Menace) and II(the Attack of the Clones)  the central theme for this expanded saga changed to the rise  fall  and redemption of Annakin Skywalker. Walking into the theater  I was dearly hoping that this film would be better than the previous two episodes. I was pleasantly surprised. No  I was AMAZED. I had originally hated the new change in theme  but Episode III did a fantastic job linking together the films. The cinematography was amazing. However  there is one point I feel I must make. Annakin Skywalker is supposed to be \""the one \"" so to speak. How come he was undercut by Obi-Wan in their duel  when he attacked from a lower elevation? Elevation had proved to be unimportant to Obi-Wan when Obi-Wan had slaughtered Darth Maul. Surely  Obi-Wan should be the one then. In any case  the films I think still must be viewed episode 4 5 6 1 2 3 to any people new to Star Wars. George Lucas revealed some information that wouldn't be beneficial to those watching the episodes in straight order. Most people have watched all the episodes already preceding this (chronologically)  so I do not think this poses to much of a problem. ****/**** or 10/10\tFollowing review does contain spoilerThe Phantom menace  very well choreographed fight scenes  top notch special effects and a few big name stars weren't enough to give the die hard star wars fans something reminiscent of the Empire Strikes Back  few years late and Attack of the Clones comes out which in all honesty the title still baffles myself as the Clones rescued the Jedi and didn't really attack anyone really  but it was an improvement on TPM as the back story behind the original saga is blown wide open and the story of Darth Vader becomes ever more complex to what we first perceived all them long years ago.1977 we see a small Rebel Starcruiser being chased relentlessly be a Stardestroyer! 2005 we see a Star Destroyer in a battle over Corusant the ships that we though represented the Evil ways of the empire and the Sith defending the Galaxy from the Droid army's of Count Dooku and General Greivus. The space battle of corusant reminiscent of that of the death star in Return of the Jedi captivates the audience and the Story of Darth Vader will become complete (in about 2 hours)  We see hoe Anakin Skywalker gives into temptation and the dark side by his arrogance at his own abilities   his thirst for more power  his disobeying and questionably of taking orders from his superiors and his reluctance to give up his possessions as well as trying to control himself through his emotions  while having all these problems he is being cleverly manipulated by Chanceller Palpatine(Darth Sidius) who is trying to turn anakin into his apprentice  Once the chancellor believes that Anakin is having premonitions of death he explains a sith legend of how a Sith lord was able to stop people from dieing  which Anakin thought would save pad-me from dieing in child birth. of course only a sith could learn such a power as the Jedi take life and death in the same hand as death means to become one with the force.On Discovering Palpatine is the Sith Lord the Jedi have been looking for  Anakin first tells the Jedi and is told to wait patiently at the Jedi temple  but he lets his emotions control him and he stops Mace Windu from killing Palpatine and in doing so gives himself to the Sith  Palpatine then initiates Order 66 and the Jedi are no more with the help of Anakin now Darth Vader as he storms the Jedi Temple and murders all Jedi and Jedi young lings even the librarian!. Obi Wan must now attempt to rescue Anakin from the dark side of kill him! Revenge of the Sith is by far the best of the star wars prequels it puts the story to rest with little fuss. The digital animation and special effects are some of the best seen in film. the performances of Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid are superb  Hayden Christiansen plays his role well and although at times seems as though he is in an adolescent strop does platy the role well enough. And a great Performance from Frank Oz once again his linguistic skills are the best in film!\tLet me begin by stating growing up that I was a huge Star Wars fan. I was one who was extremely disappointed at the Phantom Menace (e.g. I hated it) and thought Clones was just going through the motions.With Revenge of the Sith Lucas has somewhat redeemed himself. Visually  the action sequences are stunning. I saw this movie at a Digital Theatre in Manhattan  which is the way you should watch it.Lucas  has the basics elements of a great story in Sith. In the opening sequence Anakin gives into his emotions (aided on by Palpatine) to kill Count Doku after he has defeated him in battle. Basically  the emperor has arranged this to see if Anakin is the future apprentice that he wants. You realize that really everything (including the war) is being arranged by the emperor.Basically  the story revolves around the fact Anakin wants to control the future and things that occur around him  rather than letting them play their natural course (which is the Jedi way). If anything he is guilty of loving too much  when Jedi's are not suppose to have possessive love or attachment. In his fear of losing his wife Padme he is seduced by the Dark Side into thinking giving into it is the only way he can save her. The Jedi's advice on the other hand (provided by Yoda) is to let things play out. Many do not like the fact that lucas makes Vader a more pathetic creature in the end  rather than this almighty evil being we thought he was when we first saw Star Wars. However  I think after seeing what Vader looked liked  underneath the mask in Empire and Return we should have known that was really his story. A guy who could not control his demons.However  this is the problem that Lucas runs into. While he can still come out with a great story plot  he really cannot write one. The love scenes in the movie are clunky and badly written. The witisms that made the first three movies and especially Empire and Star Wars so great are few and far between. The acting in the movie is not bad. The real problem is the writing is so weak any actor would have difficulty pulling many of the lines off.In addition  there seems to be no real reason in Anakin turning. Yes  he is weary of the Jedi's (they are using him to spy on the emperor  which actually ends up being justified)  yes he is tortured by the thought of his wife dying. However  in one scene he is telling Obi Wan how much he respects him  then himself wants to destroy the emperor then boom! he turns to the dark side  there seems to be no real trigger for him to do so.In addition  I have also found that the pace of the this movie like episodes I and II is lacking. Even though the special effects are superior to IV - VI the movie seems to move much slower.Putting that aside the last 1/2 an hour or so of battle between Anakin and Obi Wan is brilliant. There is a real emotional battle occurring. Anakin fights with a real hatred that you would expect a Darth Lord too. And FINALLY in the first three movies you get a real emotion connect  as you see Anakin burning up writhing in pain telling Obi Wan that he hates him. Obi Wan yelling at him telling him that he loved him like a brother etc... before walking away in pity and disgust.Then of course you see the birth of Vader etc... Many people had a problem with Vader asking about his wife  thinking it made him too human. However  remember it is not until years of distancing himself from Anakin that he truly becomes Vader.Overall this is easily the best of the prequels  but when you watch the first trilogy you realize there is still something missing to this movie. However  it almost  almost makes up for it by being visually so stunning.7/10 Sincerely  Freedave\tI get the feeling that people's expectations of this movie are such that if Lucas didn't deliver anything short of \""Hamlet\"" they were going to resentfully dig a very deep hole in the ground and toss him in. Personally  I think I finally realized something about these Star Wars movies: they are the cinematic equivalent of comic books. I don't mean this as an insult. It's just that it's hard for me to take some of the negative reviews I've read seriously - harder to take in fact than Anakin's ridiculous reasons for turning to the dark side  or the much-derided love scenes between Anakin and Padme  or  well  Anakin as a character in general. However  Anakin as comic book hero-come-villain? Post it on Ebay and I'll bid.I really enjoyed Episode III. Perhaps it was the familiarities from the original \""Star Wars\"" that crept in towards the end  I don't know  I just did. I was prepared for the worst  which is not to say my expectations were low. But I knew what to expect from Lucas in terms of negatives  after sitting through Episodes I and II (not to mention the Ewoks of Episode VI). Fortunately  and perhaps somewhat surprisingly  these were kept to a minimum in Episode III  while Lucas finally cranked up the positives. Seen as a comic book come to life  it's just amazing. Seen as Shakespeare it's  well  pathetic. And  my word  I've seen shorter books on the works of Shakespeare than reviews of this film (unfortunately for me  my own included).I just don't know that George Lucas is trying to deliver the film that people seem to be expecting. That is  I don't think he's really aiming anywhere near the \""Best Film of the Year\"" award. I think the campiness is intentional. I think the hokiness is intentional. However  I also think there are times when the campiness and hokiness is just plain bad. Nevertheless  he's up against the collective memories of everyone who saw the first three films as an impressionable pre-teen and I just don't think he has any possibility of winning. What the viewer gets out of it will certainly depend on the baggage they bring with them.Put a completely different way  Episodes I-III are like major-leaguers hopped-up on a ridiculously large and deadly diet of steroids  such that  while performing at their absolute best within their league  they could also die at any moment. Such was the case that led to the demise of Episodes I and II. Episode III on the other hand  though suffering from permanent damage from all the steroid abuse  can certainly look forward to many years as a heroic  albeit damaged  veteran of the Star Wars World Series.\tI thought star wars episode 3 revenge of the Sith was amazing. I know people saying it isn't as good as the original star wars but i have seen the original star wars and i think the the new ones are MUCH MUCH BETTER. Hayden was great at playing Anakin because he went from being nice caring Jedi and being in love with Padme'at the beginning then slowly getting more and more anger and darker so i think he was AMAZING and he is gorgeous!!! and i thought Nataile Portman was brilliant as Padme' and she got to wear all these lovely dress which she looked great in and she had real chemistry with Hayden which you could tell on screen. and not forgetting Ewan as obi-wan was good he was great his Actsent because he is Scottish but you would never know  the whole cast is great and I loved the film and can't wait for it to come out on DVD.\tI'm a fan  not a die hard fan  but a fan  this final piece in the Star Wars Saga is in my point of view the best  not for the special effects  yet they are incredible  finally George Lucas made a story  that ties all the lose ends together created by The Phantom Menance and keeps the film moving (a problem in the other 5  sometimes.But Hayden Christensen fails big time  a good looking actor but expressing his feelings  a no no. He is empty  take the scene where he kneels before the Emperor and all the scenes with his wife Padm\u00e9  no emotion on his face to be seen  except in the Anakin versus Obi-Wan fight. Sorry but it ruins the emotional side of the movie. Lucky for me  Ian McDarmid(Palpatine)  Natalie Portman(Padm\u00e9 - even the very small role she got this time) and Ewan McGregor(Obi-Wan)are fabulous!I love this film also for another reason  it's for adults  nicely dark  very good fights and no stupid parades at the end. A movie for my sci-fi collection.\tThe first time I saw this flick  I came out of the cinema with the same disappointment I felt after seeing Menace for the first time. But on the second viewing  I realised I had gone in to it with my expectations too high. Why  after the last two films that I think are basically Universally accepted as poo? Watch Sith with no expectations  as millions did with Hope all those years ago  and you'll love it as I now do. Of course it has its unforgivable moments  such as the now infamous Vader 'NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!'  which sounds like a spoof from the Simpsons  and plot holes bigger than Lucas's neck  but who cares? I expect the 'NOOOOOOOOOOOO' will be altered for the DVD anyway. It has its big dramatic scenes that match any of those from the original trilogy  e.g Yoda fighting the Emperor  Palpatine telling Anakin about the Sith  Mace Windu being killed  Anakin VS Obi Wan (if a little shorter than promised)  the Jedi purge  Anakin becoming Vader (except 'NOOOOOOOOO' of course); and it has its nice little moments such as R2 setting two battle droids on fire  Yoda nearly being shot and dropping his cane  The Emperor grinning sadistically as Vader struggles to come to terms with Padme's apparent death - just before going 'NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!' It also does something unusual for a Lucas directed film  it allows time in emotional scenes for you to feel those emotions  rather than quickly cutting away. For example  where Anakin stands alone  torn between doing what he's been told  or rescuing Palpatine from Windu in order to save Padme.To put it simply  is it good? Yes. Is it bad? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.\tOne feature which characterised the original trilogy of Star Wars films was it's economy. They were all made on relatively low-budgets and  in episode four's case  a short space of time. This economy is also part of the action of the films themselves: They are marked by their constant action and a refusal to get mixed up in anything they don't need. The wealth of mythology that has since been created for the Star Wars universe is minimal  making the films easily accessible to non-nerds and very easy and a great pleasure to watch. At some point  George Lucas began to lose his spark. The shadow of this is seen in Return of the Jedi. From the no-frills adventure of New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back  Lucas starts indulging - particularly in pointless  cutsey teddy bears. It is at this point we hesitate to suspend our disbelief. This brings me to Revenge of the Sith. My biggest problem with RotS is Lucas' sense of humour. It is horrible. He can extend himself no further than ridiculous banter between cartoonish robots. This is a jarring and incongruous element prevalent in the prequel trilogy that ruins the experience. This could have quite easily been removed  and I cringe to imagine what HAS been left on the cutting room floor. In the original trilogy  the characterisation is reduced to a few simple archetypes - which Lucas can do. In the new films  however  his biggest mistake in these terms is trying to show the human side of his characters. the shaky dialogue and awful acting is indicative of his limitations as a director. Ah  yes  the acting. I feel I must blame the director for this. Respected stars of serious films such as Ewan McGregor are simply awful. An action film does not demand humans. Sci-Fi is all about escapism  and we want full-on heroes  not normal folks in films. Star Wars gets a very generous rating from me thanks to it's excellent special effects and graphics.5 out of ten.\tOne of the worst movies I've ever seen. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Here are some reasons why:Yoda -- In the first 3 movies Yoda's way of talking was kinda enduring and he certainly didn't mix up every sentence. Sam Jackson should have sorted him out and said something like \""looky here n*gger  your jive ass way of talking is driving everyone nuts  hear is a phone number of a speech therapist\"".The Emperor -- I didn't mind this guy so much  but when he was talking to Anakin on the balcony about some serious developments  at the end of his chat he decides to show Anakin one of his new Mr. Bean impersonations!CGI -- Far too much  not convincing and terribly confusing. Less is more George.Script -- As bad as it gets. Why didn't anyone tell George how bad it was before production?The Fights -- The one of Anakin and Obi Wan was unintentionally hilarious. As it starts they are about 2 inches away from each other and both start madly swing their light sabers not once connecting  what a couple of knuckle heads.General Grievous -- What's with this guy? I wasn't sure whether he was a seriously heavy smoker or had swallowed a fur ball  his cough just didn't make sense and was never explained.Anakin / Vader -- Hayden Christensen is not a good actor  in fact he is not even competent  and is certainly not helped by an embarrassingly bad script. And his motivation for turning to the dark side? He dreamt his wife was going to die  so what's the first thing he does as Vader? Try to kill his wife  naturally. This is just so idiotic. And the Frankenstein rip off scene was ludicrous  I mean his life was saved  he got a brilliant new outfit to wear and then he lets out a Principal Skinner \""Noooo!\"" he should have shouted \""Yippie!\""I could go on and on (and probably have a bit)  I suppose I enjoy disliking this movie. And when I watch the 3 original movies I will wonder what made Vader tu"
Stealth (2005),"I did not go into this movie with high expectations (my husband received free tickets to an advance screening). However  I was pleasantly surprised! I disagree with another reviewer - I thought the first 15 minutes were oddly paced and filmed poorly (the camera is shaking as we look in on the office of a politician initially).However  the film picks up from there with solid  well-developed characters  especially Jamie Foxx playing the role of a smart pilot who expresses the moral quandaries of his work at one point and Jessica Biel as a strong female pilot (both physically and psychologically). The audience enjoyed the movie as you could tell from their laughter at Jamie's quips.While the plot is a bit predictable  it truly is an enjoyable ride. Best of all  my husband is an aerospace engineer and he was impressed with the overall accuracy of the film \for a Hollywood movie.\"" I've had to listen to him (and his co-workers) complain about other movies  but they enjoyed it too - so we give it a thumbs up in you're in the mood for an exciting action movie - or love planes - with just a touch of romance (innuendo only  nothing graphic).\tI went into the movie with very low expectations  and came out pleasantly surprised. There's more to the movie than the previews imply. The action is exciting  the characters are rather more developed than I expected  and the plot is sufficiently complex as to be interesting. But it still has flaws. Biggest among them  if you know anything at all about aircraft you'll have to completely turn off your mind's capacity for critical thought in order to enjoy the movie. It would take pages to list all the technical inaccuracies. The worst was probably the midair refueling blimp. Yes  that's right  blimp. Second was probably the vast area these small aircraft cover on 1 refueling; from a carrier in the eastern pacific  they to the India/Pakistan region  then into Russia  then to Siberia  then Alaska  and then back to the southeast Pacific  all in a matter of a few hours. That's to say nothing of the design of the aircraft themselves  which is ludicrous.\tI have been motivated to give my comments by the only review that was available at the time.I agree about the special effects  but the show was great! Yes the story is some formula  but it did have a surprise or 2  and I liked the way it all came together. At 2 hours and change for a running time  I was never bored  and throughly entertained. It delivers what I expected  action all the way.I would recommend it to Beal fans  there is a scene by a waterfall that is amazing and contains no action at all  but does not have to. In addition  I kept thinking about the twist of events that we arrive at the end of the movie. I am still not sure if I like the ending or not  but I definitely keep thinking about it. That to me is a sign of a good movie  you keep turning it over in your mind.I am sure snotty critics will tear it apart. It ain't art  but  it is science. (Science fiction  and close to home at that.)\tI saw a free preview of this thing  and it was worth every penny that I didn't spend! I can't believe Jamie Fox would do a film like this  I mean the man won an Oscar! There are lots of \""pee pee\"" jokes  and big explosions. The pacing was kind of sluggish. I think I got bored only a few minutes into the movie. There were all the usual clich\u00e9s you would expect  and few surprises. If you've seen the TV ads then you probably can see where this is headed. It's like what if Hal (the computer from 2002) was a stealth jet? It all seems so generic. It's pretty much a typical run-of-the-mill action movie. If you like booming noise and explosions  you'll love it. If you have a brain you might be bored. I'll give it a \""3\""  because they put Jessica Biel in a bikini.\tI just got back from an advance screening of Stealth and I must say  as a very picky person  I was rather surprised by the movie overall.I'll attempt to right a fair summary :)To start I must say Stealth is a good package of action  comedy  drama  politics  even a little romance. Despite a few dislikes of my own  I would have to say this is one of the best movies I've seen this year. It definitely beat iRobot in my book  and not so hokey overall as compared to batman begins. I would have a hard time deciding which had a better story. I would possibly put it above War of Worlds  but only because I wasn't very happy with the overall feel of WoW.On to some key point reviews:Visuals: 8 At some points views seem distorted  flattened (mostly in the zoom angles)  but overall pretty realistic and a lot of interesting effects (combat and otherwise). The camera action was well done  very authentic  not overplayed like in some movies (ie Borne Supremacy).Plot: 9 The plot follows the trailer closely  but has many surprises that you won't expect. Things will happen that some people won't like  but overall these things add to the \""feel\"" of the movie and it really makes you wonder what next? Overall the plot was very good.Characters: 8 I have to say they played the characters out pretty well in this one  though at some points you will be annoyed by the amount of stereotyped personas. As a whole  it fits well and the progression of character development was smooth and felt about right most of the time.Dialog: 7 I really don't even feel right giving this a 7  but there was a lot of good banter with the bad. One of the biggest issues I have is the amount of backtalk in this movie. Anyone that knows anything about the military will know what I mean when they see this. Other than that most of the lines are fairly well placed  and there is a good integration of comedy and romance into the serious nature of the movie.That's all I can come up with right now  but I hope it's enough of something to think about.\tI absolutely do not know  why people have put thumbs down for this movie  because I thought before going to the theater that I'm wasting 75 bucks behind the ticket  but after watching the movie  I felt so good that I even treated my friend for free. The movie has got a weak story line  but thats made up by some quite mind blowing action  visual effects  and camera workmanship. The movie is very gripping with a steady flow of heavenly music in the background. The soundtrack is a must buy for anyone who watched this movie. The camera action has to be mentioned again as should be the visual effects  the plane crashes with slow motion action cameras are simple out of this world... Josh Lucas does a respectable job  so does Jessica Biel  although the romance developing between them is shown somewhat clumsily  Jamie Fox does another cameo performance as a comic side kick  making it more enjoyable...Also  the soundtrack for this movie is unearthly  it's so so damn good that it's hard to explain.. This movie also shows a part of the dirty cover work of the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Airforce  clearly pointing out the corruption involved...Overall a very well deserving 9/10...\tBe nice  people! It opened here in holy Ireland yesterday  Friday 5th. Mr Cohen is following the beaten track  like Mr Foxx. Do something difficult  and praiseworthy if possible  then take the CGI action thriller blow-em-up burn-it-all-down and bring home a 'dumpster' of money.XXX had its moments and its faults and Cohen convinced Hollywood he could make a success of a CGI-driven thriller. He has a conscience; he didn't do 'XXX2 \u0096 next level'.Jamie Foxx did magnificent work and got a very well deserved Oscar for Ray. Let's take it easy  sit at a caf\u00e9 table in a lovely place  sit in a cockpit in a safe warm studio  have 30 ish lines to say and watch the royalties roll in.Jessica \u0096 oh  Jessica\u0085 Ren\u00e9e stand aside  please. You're blocking my view. Cameron  it's about time I told you \u0096 you're too skinny. Oh oh Jessica. Do come back soon.Mel Gibson took some big risks \u0096 Braveheart etc. and (I presume) had to swallow his pride and wave the flag (literally) in The Patriot. His presence  a dastardly Englishman  and a fine piece of script writing (in the beginning \u0096 father/son/independence/war..) earned enough money to broach a risky subject like Viet Nam (\""We were soldiers once\"" \u0096 but he had to keep Scottish music; did the bean counters insist on this? And keep Hal Moore away from a microphone?).Educational aspects \u0096 no American film is complete without trying to teach us something. Most action movies take place over sea or in one American city. Well done this movie for moving outside the borders! Notice that Hollywood is no longer telling us to hate Arabs? North Koreans are being lined up as the next big hate. (We used to hate Mohammed Khaddafi  remember? Then we moved on an Ayatollah. We sold his neighbour weapons to keep the Ayatollah under control but  oh dear\u0085) The map in the cockpit shows neighbouring countries that most white people didn't know existed on the Chinese border. There is such a place as Alaska where stuff happens apart from oil spillages. There are white people there. Unfortunately they're not nice. Sorry  Alaska  tourism takes another blow. Better luck in the next film! There are TWO Koreas. Near Korea there ARE other countries. Some of them let us blow up their buildings in their capital cities  some of them are harmless farmers.OK O K \""Stealth\"" has its weaknesses \u0096 well done to that 'user' who saw magnificent Jessica take a 'hail Mary' sniper shot in the shoulder which made her limp \u0096 but the lads are entitled to rest on their laurels and there were more twists near the end than I expected.P.S.: I notice the spell checker is whingeing about US versus UK spelling!\tThis movie in general was an OK movie. You go to a horror film to see horror You got to a si-fi movie to see si-fi. and so-on so-on. This movie STEALTH however Didn't rock as much as I had been lead up to believe it would. It was good and all but it seems that in the wake of 9-11 Hollywood for the most part deems that everyone now is a terrorist and must use that in their movies to make people come and see them.I don't get it. The plot is kinda weak. An out of control A.I. Airdrone going to kill hundreds of thousands of people? Does anybody remember \""Deal of the Century?\"" I felt robbed. It had reminded me of \""I-ROBOT\"" feel only with wings. \""EDI\"" as the Airdrone is called I never bought him as being a character either  is made from a civilian agency i think ( It was never really explained who made it) and is put into service without being tested? Only in Hollywood. The sets made to resemble the aircraft carrier bays were shoddy at best. The set of Showgirls were better. I'm not saying that this was Awful like Constintine but they could of done a hole lot better. At one point i was kinda looking towards someone being voted off this straight to Radio movie. The actors couldn't save this disaster from its fate. The film got better towards the the last half. The animation was the best i have seen in a film in a long time. The camera angles that were chosen were fantastic. I did like to see the \""deployment action\"" of the rockets as there going off and some of the CATTAPULT launches of the stealth's off the aircraft carrier had looked so real and the level of detail in the cockpit during flight  even though wouldn't exist in an actual military plane were great. A rating of a seven is probably the best this movie is going to get due to a poorly written  poorly scripted poorly screened  and cookie cutter type of film. But kudos to the level of action  camera angles  overall look of the airplanes themselves and the end credits Do Better Hollywood\tIt's basically like a Sci-Fi B movie. The airplane dogfights and action were great but  the storyline and acting were not up to par. Jamie Foxx the great actor and entertainer that he is  seemed to be overdoing it. His jokes or ad-libs of scenes did not really fit in. The whole idea of the A.I. jet was poorly conceived  which added to it's B movie ( knight rider ) feeling.Jessica Biel seems to be the action genre's choice at the moment. She was great in the last Blade installment  but again this movie did not work for her either.Bacially it's a rental in waiting...\tStealth was a pretty decent movie  but it lacked of something..... They also overdid the innuendo. A lot of what they said was supposed to be funny but they were just crude. and obnoxious.The innuendos parts didn't even go along with the movie  they should have deleted those scenes. But the Stealth fighter scenes were sweet  and the special effect were off the chain .I liked the movie but it could have been way better. I recommend it for anyone who can handle a few offensive comments  and intensive  fast pace action.I rate this movie 7/10 because it was good (i liked it but it could of been way better) if you are reading this and are debating to go see it with a friend  only go if your a big fan of one of the actors.\tGood action This movie is another action flick as we all have seen a lot of before. It provides good fun for the moment though. It's the story about how technology takes more and more part of the warfare in todays world  for good and bad. Of course  since it is a Hollywood movie  there's a little love plot going on as well  even though it was toned down. Jessica Biel gives a good performance and are shining brighter and brighter as a star. Let's just hope she gets some better roles in the near future.Some things annoyed me though during the movie  for instance how they can fly 10 000 miles on 20 minutes  but then it takes 2 hours to get 500 miles. And of course there were some really stupid one liners  I'm sure you wont missed them.\tThis film is absolutely dreadful  very boring. so predictable and no real plot. not even a good actor in sight. Would not recommend  really awful film. Trailer looked good thats why i watched it  but the graphics was a real let down  very disappointing. Some of the plane scenes are OK but not very realistic if anyone was to ask me i would tell them the truth  but let them see for themselves  but i rate this film a 1. If this film had a couple of decent actors like: Will Smith or Jessica Alba then it would probably be good. very disappointed. Expected it to be a lot better than what it was. Normally i love a good film with lots of action or comedy i watch a lot of movies and would be happy to comment on various films.\tWhen i went to see this movie i had low expectations mainly because of the low rating and user reviews. But after seeing it i was surprised as to why the movie is hated by our viewers. The movie plot is not bad and special effects are Mind Blowing. This movie has one of the best special effects i have seen in an air combat movie. The acting has been pretty fine too.Jesicca is looking pretty good too. I wouldn't say superb but above average. The movie is pretty loud. That means there is special effects sound buzzing most of the time. But its okay as it adds to the excitement. So i think it worth watching. Watch it and say worth the penny & time.\tThis movie is Super Excellent. Everybody should see this movie. I Absolutely Love Stealth. Jamie Fox is so hot and good in this movie. Jessica Biel is great in this. The only bad thing was the way Charles Ndibe acted in this movie. Charles was really bad. A error in the movie was that I was not in it because i am the best actor in the world as everybody knows. But a good thing is that my uncle Josh Lucas was in this. He probably played the hardest roll in this movie and did spectacular this part. The special effects in this movie were great. These effects caught you by surprise and made you say wow how did they make that look so real.LOVE  meghan41289\tRun of the mill summer movie. Action  flesh  and romance in a summer movie. The staple of any summer movie. Stealth has Biel and Lucas as leads  and both actors perform well considering the material given. Foxx why did you take that role? I hope Foxx's answer is money. What worked is the plane look real  and I could see pilot-less planes one day. What did not work. Why would a computer download music? Answer for the movie soundtrack  in order to sell CD's. Why did the computer go haywire? The question should have been answered. I like the Alaska and North Korea bit  but a little too Ramboish. 6 out of 10. It is an okay movie  save it for a rental on a rainy night.\tStealth is one of those Summer movies whose music is loud  its explosions are even louder  and its screams of \""I HAVE NO REAL STORY!\"" are the loudest.But what else do you expect from Rob Cohen  the director who brought us The Fast and the Furious and XXX? If you dare answer  \""Hitchcockian suspense and Capra-esquire storytelling \"" then you truly deserve any slaps in the face that you receive today.So we've established that it's best not to expect much substance from a Rob Cohen film  but how does Stealth stack up against the other two movies I just mentioned? This may alarm some of you  but it's the weakest of the three. I know that statement is probably enough to send most of you screaming for the hills  and so be it. If you don't like outlandish action movies then you probably shouldn't be considering this one in the first place. But what if you happen to be a Cohen fan? Well  let's explore the issue a little further.The movie does have a few things going for it. Hmm  there's Jessica Biel! That's one very good thing. And then there are the special effects. We get lots of jets flying around really fast  blowing things up  and it all looks really spiffy keen. So that's two. Let's see  what else? Jessica. Biel. Bikini. Aaaaaaand  that's about it. Oh  and the gals might like Josh Lucas. If that sounds like enough to warrant $8+ of your hard-earned money then knock yourself out.But what's the moral of this story? Beyond the eye candy  there just isn't much here. Seriously  without Ms. Biel and the special effects  what is there? A compelling  gripping story? *snicker* Yeah  good one. Come on  it's another computer-operated-weaponry-gone-wrong story  and as such it doesn't offer much new to the genre. There are a couple of surprising moments  but they're not handled in such a way as to generate any real shock value.One of my main problems with the movie is that too much time is spent in the air. I'm sorry  but I can watch jets fly around and blow stuff up for only so long before I start to get bored. You've got Jessica Biel in your movie - why make her wear a huge flight suit and helmet for so much of the running time?? And would it have hurt to have a little character development? The attempts are so miniscule that it made me wonder why they even tried at all. I can't quite place my finger on it  but there's just something about the interaction of all the characters that seemed too forced. None of them really clicked. The dialogue is of such quality that you get the feeling that everybody is just trying a little too hard to reel off a pithy one-liner. Jamie Foxx is the worst culprit.At least he doesn't have to worry about making extra shelf space next to his Oscar this year. He reverts back to his unfunny The Jamie Foxx Show days and the one-liners he drops on us are bigger bombs than those dropping from his jet. He's supposed to be suave  ya see  saying stuff like  \""I fly jets. You like to go fast?\"" Bwa. ha. ha. Give me a minute ... hold up ... side won't stop hurting ... ah  I can breathe again. Hey man  you forgot  \""I fly jets  and I've just gotta ask - is there an airport nearby or is that my heart taking off?\"" His character is more appropriate for an episode of Blind Date than an elite flight program.And I really don't expect a lot of believable action from a Cohen film  but couldn't we be given something just a tad more conceivable than having Jessica Biel being shot at by a well-trained North Korean army and barely being grazed by a bullet? Yet we're supposed to believe she pokes her gun up from behind some rubble  starts firing  and takes out a few guys? Riiiiight. At this point I started to lose focus on the \""story\"" and centered all my energy on admiring Ms. Biel's lovely figure.The movie also has a few romantic dabblings  but they're mostly restrained. What this means is they give Josh Lucas some 2-day beard growth and make him and Jessica reluctantly ogle each other. It's a little cheesy at times  but at least it isn't overdone.I know I've had more negative things to say about the movie than positive  but it's not *horrible*. It's just not all that great. It's one of those movies that caters to our most visceral desires. There are some moviegoers who only ask for beautiful people  loud music  and impressive effects. If you can accept that along with the weak story  awkward attempts of humor  and lack of character development then you may get the entertainment you're seeking.\tWell  I love action  and I love Jessica Beil  shes plain beautiful. The movies a little clich\u00e9  u know whats gonna happen way before it does in the team. A black guy  a beautiful girl and a white guy. U know who's gonna die  who will be close to death and live and who will be the hero. The commercials only show the first half of the movie. Sort of I  Robot type of middle. The last 10 seconds are actually sort of funny. The action and special effects are incredible. The in air sequences are well made. A few factual mistakes but nothing huge. The acting was not bad  it was actually pretty good  could have been better but it was good. I just want to reiterate the fact that Jessica Beil is beautiful. All in all  it's a good movie  I would recommend it in theaters because u wont get the feel on a couch!!\tHere's just a smattering of what's beyond wrong with this film: i) It suggests that it's acceptable behaviour to use a plane to destroy a very tall building in a built up area Yes  really ! ii) It's also perfectly OK to send planes in the airspace of a peaceful nation and kill the pilots sent up to intercept you without even trying to make radio communication with them.iii) North Koreans are not human and thus can be killed willy nilly if you happen to illegally enter their country.I could on and on but I'm sure the other reviewers will have pointed out the hundreds of other problems with this movie. Suffice it to say this film is NOT so bad it's good  it's just simply awful  a waste of the planet's resources and that every single person connected with its creation should be very deeply ashamed of what they have created.Bottom line = DO NOT PAY TO SEE THIS CRUD.\tThis movie is a video game although not as much fun because you can't fly the planes.Three fighter pilots -- Josh Lucas (as Lt. Ben Gannon -- sort of like Cannon  get it?)  Jessica Biel as Kara Wade  and Jamie Foxx as Henry Purcell -- have to contend with a top secret  state-of-the-art  all-computer controlled  fighter plane named EDI. That's like \""Eddie\"" in case you didn't catch it. It makes the computer's name easy to say. Sort of like HAL from 2001. Which is what the screenwriter had in mind when he created EDI. EDI can talk. Unfortunately  EDI's voice is effeminate. Which makes him about as scary as a paper airplane. As if that's not enough  the lame things EDI says while he flies in formation are too funny. There is absolutely no military protocol followed during communications. In fact  everybody's dialog sounds like kids making it up. \""I'm going in.\"" \""If you don't come back  I'll have to shoot you down.\"" \""Look out. Incoming.\"" Somewhere about 45 minutes into the movie the three of them are on R& R in Thailand. We get to see Jessica Biel in a swimsuit by a waterfall and this part of the movie is like a travelogue. It looks nice. We also get to hear Jessica Biel say this line: \""I have to go peepee.\"" After she comes back from peepee  she all but propositions Ben Gannon (sort of like Cannon  get it?). Being the disciplined pilot that he is  he rejects her proposition. Does this guy have self control or what. Lucky for him  the movie makes a jump cut (one of many) so he's suddenly in a hangar being briefed on an urgent mission to Tajikistan which  as Sam Shepard his commander reminds us  was part of the former Soviet Union. Furthermore  EDI is going to be part of the mission. \""But he hasn't been battle tested \"" Ben Gannon says. Tough  he's going with you. The rest of the plot is ridiculous and isn't worth telling.This movie is edited like a video game. Between scenes I'm surprised the screen didn't go blank while the next level loaded.The FX are very poor. There is a slow motion shot of a plane crashing into a mountain and as the plane collapses the fuselage breaks into flat vectors so it looks much like an explosion in an old video game.This movie was written for teenage boys who play video games. They'll love it. Nothing against them. But for everyone else...YOU LOSE. GAME OVER.\tI am giving this movie an excellent because the script seems to be written by someone who understands that life is just an illusion of stories  and that people get so caught in story that they can no longer tell good from evil.There seems to be no real differentiation between the \""good guys\"" and the \""bad guys\"" as everyone in the movie is somewhat psychotic and completely lost in their particular illusion. Very interesting handling of how life probably seems to the spiritually enlightened.I probably won't write anymore reviews as even at this length  I am not able to submit as I don't have the minimum number of lines. But I am done talking about the movie  so I will try it again."""
Submerged (2005 Video),"Submerged starring Steven Seagal! Its his newest film released on DVD and I have very mixed emotions about it. I liked it because the camera effects were cool and the action was good and then I didn't like it. I'll go through the good and the bad below.THE GOOD 2 OK: The fights: YEAH!!! Steven Seagal fights Gary Daniels! Camera shots: The jumpy camera work was a cool feature to the movie.The actors: Steven Segal and Gary Daniels together in a film and they fight each other! Is this a sign that other well known martial arts actors will be in Seagal's future movies? William Hope and Vinny Jones have appearances. The two women were neat.THE BAD 2 WORST: Seagal's talking: He'd change his voice constantly to a light voice and then a deep voice and if that wasn't bad enough he'd change his accent like a southerner then to a cowboy and then back to the regular accent we're all used too. What the heck was up with that?The fights: There was only a couple but they were OK because they weren't long I mean extremely brief! Daniels was no match for Seagal as he got killed by Seagal. The big bodyguard guy was absolutely not even a sparing partner and the fight with him and Seagal! I mean dang it  a guy like that should have lasted longer! Nick Brimble: Was he trying be Jack Palance or thought he was him? Plot: It was confusing as everything just jumped around back and fourth  back and fourth! The color: The color kept on changing and changing! Why? The dialog: Examples: (Gary Daniels: I'm taking over this Submerine now! Steven Seagal: You're just gonna have to kill me I guess...) (Steven Seagal: Let me ask you a question. What kind of damn fool do you think I am? I'm still in prison for doing the same thing you're about to ask me to do again). I thought a lot of the dialog was funny and I laughed at most of it.The camera work: Why was there so much camera effects? It seemed funny because even when someone got killed they didn't fall like they should. Instead it seemed like they skipped a spaces and got to the ground earlier than you'd expect? The opera concert: Hopw the conductor looked up and here and there when guys were getting killed.Surely everything that seemed funny was unintentional? Right? There many other points I could point out but there are too many of them. You may consider this film to be one of those that are so bad is its films. I would only recommend this film to people who like unintentional hilarious moments in films and of course Seagal completest and hardcore fans.Movie Nuttball's NOTE: If you are big Steven Seagal fan like Me then I strongly recommend you to check out these other great movies! Above the Law  Hard to Kill  Marked for Death (Must see because it great!)  Out for Justice (Great!)  Under Siege  On Deadly Ground (Really good!)  Under Siege 2: Dark Territory (Very good!)  The Glimmer Man (In My opinion his all time best and one of the greatest films ever!)  Fire Down Below (Excellent!)  The Patriot  Ticker  The Foreigner (Surprising great!)  Out for a Kill  Belly of the Beast  and Into the Sun (Great sword fighting)!\tI don't care what everyone thinks about this flick. It is the best movie I have watched this summer. And I am deadly serious.. You have to watch it over and over to really appreciate it.. It kind of grows on u... Trust me if u like action flicks watch this movie and you wont be disappointed. The story is interesting  Seagall delivers some great lines and the villains are very-well played.. This is not a masterpiece of course  full of factual inaccuracies (as some ppl from Uruguay rightfully pointed out) but I for myself don't expect such stuff from a Seagall movie anyway. Btw anyone has any idea why this movie is an UK-Bulgaria co-production? Is Hollywood done with Steven?\tProbably the worst movie ever !! Not only is very badly performed and directed  its incredible the lack of knowledge regarding the country where everything occurs  Uruguay  it shows Mayan ruins only 150 miles from Montevideo (capital city) Mayas have NEVER been near Uruguay !! Not only that  in the Mayan ruins you can observe a gigantic head which belongs to a much ancient civilization and is only found in the Isla de Pascua (Chile)  some thousands miles away... Apparently for these guys Spanish and Italian languages are the same...you can clearly read CHIUSO/APERTO (italian) in the submarine dashboard  but one of the guys says he is the specialist in Spanish !! No wonder this movie has been prohibited in Uruguay  I know we don't belong to First World countries but this is offensive from every point of view.\tSubmerged? We were on the sub for ...what? 10 minutes? Also  I never saw evidence of a nuclear sub...rather  the hull of a WWII Diesel/Electric.The F/X were...well...lousy. Background in cars was bad. Ship in the ocean was bad. Drone in the air was really bad. Segal was in the shadows and bad. Fighting was not realistic.They show the aircraft carrier USS Independence  but call it the \Clinton\""??? Ewwww.I just couldn't follow the story line. Not because it was complicated  but because it just doesn't make sense.Segal has a price. Whatever he got paid for this movie is it!\tThis Movie Is Set In A World Where The Mayans Conquered The World To Then Be Defeated Only By The Mongol Tribes. The Mongol Tribes Reside Now In Pubs In South America  Arm Wrestling With Every Girl They Can Find. Then The Offspring Of Heidi Immigrate To South America Along With A Bunch Of Goats Becoming Suicide Bombers At The Age Of 18. This New South America Breeds An Elite New Social Class Where Every Child Is Born And Raised To Be A Dictator Or Drug Dealer  Every Elite Child Born Into This New Social Class Is Named \""EL PRESIDENTE\"" (The President). But Not All Is Lost STEVEN SEGAL AND THE US IS THERE TO BRING DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM TO EVERYONE\tI have read most of the comments made by the Uruguayan and American people regarding this movie. I was born in Uruguay long now I'm a American citizen and live in the states. One thing is you can not judge every American because one or few people in the movie has no idea where Uruguay is or what they have  it is obvious that the director for this movie is an ignorant  due to the fact that if you do not know where the Mayan lived  you really need to go back to the books and do some study then what type of Spanish is spoken in Uruguay because it is different from other Spanish speaking countries  they speak Castellan. I know for a fact that Uruguay is a very peaceful country I go there every year to spend my long vacation and every time I have lots of fun with my Uruguayan friends and never ever had any problems with no one there in fact people there will definitely know that I'm not from Uruguay and they treat you like a king. So my advice to the Uruguayan people is don't worry about those ignorant movie producers and makers  they really don't care about any country  not even their own  all they care about is making money\tThis is the worst movie from Steven Segal. As well  the lack of knowledge about Uruguay is a disgrace. The writer and producers should re-visit their geography text books. Next time  use an imaginary country  instead of insulting all the Uruguayans around the world. It's a shame to see our Flag flying sideways  the native going around with goats on a Bolivian outfit  the Mayan ruins near Montevideo  a total lack of knowledge about everything. Just do a search on the Internet  and you will find all the facts about Uruguay  it is not the Banana republic that portraying in this poor excuse of a movie. I used to enjoy Steven movies  I will now burn the ones I have on my collection. Shame on you.\tHaha  I just voted awful but it is actually funny. Although perhaps just for us  native Mayans born in Bulgaria who immigrate to Uruguay in 100 BC to build up the ruins and bring the goats. Let alone talk about the mountains! that took a while :) Hey  wait a second  where are the Swedish girls! I missed these ones :) I wonder if Jorgito had something to do with this  he always seemed to live in a different country :)I read http://www.elpais.com.uy/05/08/03/ultmo_166644.aspwe are going to take legal actions  well  that is not gonna change what the ignorants here in US will think about us. Let me tell you a story. I flew to Mexico to actually see the 'real' Mayan ruins and sat next to me where two US girls (I hate to say Americans for obvious reasons) whom filled in: 'Nationality: white' in the immigration forms. No comments :)Aunque Soy Carbonero  No Seran Las Ruinas Manyas De Las Que Estan Hablando?  Es Que El Futbol Se Esta Llendo Al Joraca! Aguante la Celeste!!!(QUE PAJERIA ESTO QUE TENES QUE ESCRIBIR CON MAYUSCULAS!)\tReally a case for taking the movie out of the market! The use of Uruguay name and flag without having done a proper background research on the country should be punished. Uruguay is a beautiful country and is far away from what is pictured in the movie. The good thing is that Uruguayans are very proud of their country (as every one should be) and they will make their voice strong on this topic. Anyaway a good one will be that Uruguay invites the Director of the movie and maybe Seagal too  to a visit to the country so they can see how far away from the reality they are. Apart from this  for all the ones that think that this type of wrong impression given in movies does not harm   they are very wrong. Most of the people nowadays get to know about different countries and cultures via movies. Uruguay is a very touristic place and this bad image can cost them a lot  but on the other hand the type of tourism that goes to Uruguay won't be even close to a movie like this Cheers\tObviously  you \""americans\"" don't learn geography in school. This is shown clearly in this movie. I'm not going to review all the geographical  language and political mistakes made in this movie. But I want to say that URUGUAY is maybe the most peaceful country in the world. We may not have palm trees or blue-water beaches (which we don't  as you may think)  but I can assure you that our people is not the kind of terrorists depicted in this movie. Not even the people of other south American countries are like that. However  we are the target of your infamous jokes. Not only Steven Seagal is guilty of this crap  but also other actors  like your beloved Californian governor. In the end i'd like to add that if you see this movie  laugh and don't believe in it. PD: Thanks to every Uruguayan who place their comment re-assuring the real condition of our country (I'm sorry that I can't write this in Spanish  the page won't let me)\tI admit it. I like Steven Seagal movies. It is a \""guilty pleasure\"" because most of his recent movies could hardly be called \""good\"". I also have a odd fondness for submarine movies. So I couldn't believe my luck when Mr. Seagal made a movie called \""Submerged\"".There are BIG problems with this movie  however. The plot makes little sense from beginning to end. I can accept a little silliness in an action movie but watching a group of supposedly highly trained commandos stand in the middle of a concrete tunnel and just \""shoot it out\"" with an oncoming squad of soldiers (with a tank  mind you) without ducking for cover is not good nor believable action.I'm not certain: why the submarine was located where it was; why it was stolen by commandos; why they approach a US carrier group submerged and without radioing them first; why the \""brain washed\"" soldiers take over the sub and order them to submerge when they already ARE submerged; why the carrier group commander orders the sub to be fired at only if it surfaces (because we all know subs are much more dangerous and up to no good when they surface) and on and on. And to top it all off  the submarine wasn't even in much of the movie.The plot and plot holes only get deeper from there. Mr. Seagal's signature fighting style is only demonstrated rarely and in extreme closeup. And I have no idea why it was set in Uruguay. I'm not certain any of the people involved with this move has ever been to Uruguay or can even point to it on a map. Does Uruguay even have submarines?In fairness  this movie does not appear cheaply made. It had okay stunt  special effects  lots of gunfire and explosions. The submarine unfortunately looks like something I made in my backyard as a kid  however. I still like Mr. Seagal's movies. They are still silly fun. But avoid this one. Go rent \""Under Siege\"" or \""The Glimmer Man\"" instead (my personal favorites).\tFirst of all  in a scene the newspaper said 'Uruguaians' and then 'Uruguayans'. It's supposed that a writer must write a script ( it's obvious! )  but this movie seems to be made by a third grade boy. That was just to show the lack of talent....\u00cd'm a fan of B class movies; but when a movie makes so many mistakes ( and you don't need money to fix them  but common sense ) It turns really bad.By the way... I don't know why I'm writing in English!-- Here goes some words in Spanish  but the system didn't let me publish them --If you decide to waste part of your life seen this movie  please try to remember that it's only science fiction. I't a shame that a country it's been insulted for free\tIt is true that an action movie is not intended to educate  but it is important that the consumers have the tools interpret and judge when its fact and when its fiction. In committing this sort of gross mistakes the writer and all of the producing line are not making fun out of us  Uruguayans  but showing contempt for their audience  you. I would love to read an opinion of an American who has never came to Uruguay alerting about the fallacious statements directly and indirectly found in the movie. When a spectator assumes a passive position becomes a trash can  but if her or him applies an active role  evacuating doubts  informing oneself or even sending any sort of feedback to the stakeholders  even a shameful product like this could be a growing opportunity. Don't be so obnoxious  learn  study  in the XXI century the Umbilicus Mundi doesn't exist any more. Break the shell.\tI saw this film and I couldn't believe it  URUGUAY being a country dominated by terrorists??? Did you study geography when you where KIDS? apparently no  or you only studied your own country  because you think your county is the best and you don't get out of it!!. Uruguay had neverhad terrorists. and only the 0.5% of the population speaks in English!. and we speak a different Spanish that the one that was used on the movie!!. I will speak about Uruguay: Uruguay is a little country between Argentina and Brazil (I suppose you know Argentina and Brazil) we were soccer world champions 2 times on 1930 and on 1950; we sell lots of cow meat to your the USA; and only the 5% of the population is black;\tHello. I am writing to demand an explanation about this movie. Yesterday i was checking on the news when suddenly the reporter started to talk about a Steven Seagal's movie where he has to kill a bunch of terrorist which nationality is URUGUAYAN. Well  let me tell you  i live here  in Uruguay  since i was born. I am an Uruguayan graphic designer who is really shocked about this fact of the movie. We are not terrorists...just for you to know  we are one of the smallest countries of south America and aren't a powerful nation. But we have something that the Americans have too... its called PROUD.. YES.. we are proud of our little piece of land.. where the people is kind.. and have great values and moral. This is the reason why i'm writing.. i feel an enormous anger for the producers of the film.. and for MR. SEAGAL too... who only makes stupid extra violent action movies.... Well.. what can i say... from this side of the river.. there's a dissatisfied country.. Especially because this year Oscar's winner for \""BEST MOVIE SONG\""  Jorge Drexler  is Uruguayan too. And an other thing to add.. the movie was filmed in Bulgary... WHERE NOTHING IS EVEN NEAR IN APPEARANCE TO URUGUAY...\tThis picture is based in a country with bananas  terrorists  tyrant government  Heidi's girls raising goats...COME ON!!! URUGUAY IS IN SOUTH America  and we raise COWS no goats!!! This is one of the most peaceful countries in America  that's one of the most particular characteristics of our country. We have nothing in common with BULGARY (where it was filmed)  we don't have Maya's ruins (that is in north and central America  please!!!)  and we can't hide a submarine!! If you want to create a new country  be my guest! But you are showing this movie all over the world with bad concepts and a very poor history. Please...search a little more before you film a movie!!!\tOK  we all know what we are to expect from a S.S. film. Definitely not good quality cinema  but a lot of laughs! Even if I did get the laughs  I also got quite upset about how they portray our country. The level of ignorance of these people is astounding!!What you can find in the real Uruguay: people whose language is Spanish and whose accent is different from the rest of South America and only similar to the Argentinian accent; democracy; very little evidence of our Indian heritage; European looking people (we are mostly descendants of Spanish and Italian immigrants)What you will find in \""submerged\"" Uruguay: people who speak Spanish with a totally different accent from ours  probably from Central America; people whose written language is sometimes Italian  sometimes another language (pay attention to submarine instructions  find the words \""telefon\"" and \""revolution\""); a revolution going on; Mayan ruins (!!!); Viking looking men and Swedish looking women(!!!!!)So  just for the record  the country you'll see in submerged is not Uruguay (actually  it's Bulgaria)  though for some reason the people involved in submerged thought it would be a good idea to say it takes place here. Anyway  I invite everyone to laugh at this joke of a film  just remember our country is nothing like submerged shows... and if you know someone from Uruguay  watch submerged together  and you'll have even more fun!!!\tSorry  I am cheating because I didn't see it  but being an Uruguayan  having read the plot  and having watched some other awful Seagal's movies is enough for me. In fact  I became aware of this movie as it appeared today in Urugay's newspapers as an hilarious article. As another uruguayan said  this film is a celebration of ignorance! We don't have goats  we don't have any Mayan ruins  we have a (truly) democratic government with 80% of acceptance among the population  we have no terrorists at all (and we don't like them either) and no major incident has happened here since the late 70's. Also  we are a *sub*-tropical country with no bananas at all  having a nice 0 to 10 Celsius degree winter right now. It is all so ridiculous that the film is truly becoming a cult movie down here! Everyone wants to watch it (including me). After all  there are not many good funny films around lately...\tI am from Urguguay and i couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing!!!!! Is not that hard go to internet or to an encyclopedia and search a little bit about the country that you are going to make a movie in!!! Lets review some misunderstands:we don't have goats!  we have cows  sheets  horses... but not goats!!:( We don't have mountains! We don't have Maya's ruins!!we never had Mayas! We don't have bananas! We don't have terrorists! We don't look like people from Peru or Bolivia. Anyway i have to say that for a moment it was funny ;) see all this ruins and mountains he he he. But at the same time i felt a little insulted from the director of this movie because he had no idea what he was talking about. I have no idea what they were trying to do  they needed a place to make their movie but they cant just invent a culture and a geography and people and a government to a country that already exists!! If you want to invent a new country its OK for me but don't put the name of mine in your non existing place. it is very disrespectful to all south American countries the fact that Hollywood feels free to say and show absolutely everything that they want about us including fakes things. so Anthony for your next movie just try to be a little more informed OK?\tI don't have much to say about this movie except that I did not enjoy it  thus I do not recommend this movie at all! Its first problem was that it had next to no plot and was very hard to follow. Secondly the entire movie seemed to be a lot of (random) shooting and violence. The acting is mediocre. A lot of it centers around Segal; he is just out to be the \""hero\"" and have good lines. In general  I didn't find the acting particularly inspiring or even entertaining. Do not be fooled by the seemingly exciting summary on the back of the DVD because I assure you there is not much of a story! Unfortunately  not even the \""special effects\"" impressed me this time!"""
Team America: World Police (2004),"I love \South Park\"" and the movies but flat hated this one. It's a waste of film. It's almost as if they were exhausted and ran out of ideas in the first five minutes. It's just too much and did not have the wit I expect. I never thought I'd think one of their pieces were dorky but this one? Yup  dorky. Maybe I asked for it when I rented the MA version or maybe all the raunchiness is funnier coming out of the mouths of 7 year olds. I admire the trying of something completely new with the marionettes but they are even more flat than the \""South Park\"" characters. The complete lack of PC has never bothered me with this bunch but it's got to be funny and this isn't.\tThis is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I am a big fan of sarcasm  and love Southpark and Family Guy. This movie had a very thin plot  bad voice-overs  was loud and grating on my nerves. I expected the movie to be witty  but it was not. It's humor appeals to the most juvenile of instincts (much like the true war that Bush has waged). I watched the first 30 minutes and may have laughed once or twice. This movie in my opinion is the most over-rated I have ever watched. For the life of me  I can't see why it has received such good reviews. Any knuckle head could have written such a poor story. I would advise any one to save their money  and buy some ice cream during this hot hot summer.\tthats really awful  the terrorists in Cairo??Oh GOd  whoever made this movie don't have a clue on whats going on.   I lived in Egypt for 20 years  and people don't even look like that. Cairo is a city of like 6 million cars  with flyovers  bridges and subway system. And what the hell was that language  you people  maybe should watch a little bit more from CNN or BBC  they have good coverages on countries like that. And wait a minute  destroying the great pyramid  even Napoleon failed to do it  what a bad taste. I realize that making a spoof is funny  OK they obviously got jealous of thunder birds so thats the reason for this move. BAD BLOODY TASTE.\tI'm giving this a 7 primarily on the strength of one song whose title I don't think I can write out & which might be considered a spoiler. It's a classic of our time...\""America. F**k Yeah!\"" I can just picture the guys with the \""Terrorist Hunting Permits\"" on their pickups singing along with this song like it's the next \""I'm Proud to be An American!\"" The whole \""world police\"" idea is great - making fun of the fact that we are jumping into situations without understanding them  blowing up a lot of stuff  and declaring victory. The technical achievement of this movie is pretty impressive (not the puppet sex scene which looks like stuff I did with my Barbies & that's what makes it funny - I mean the action scenes).\tThis movie rocks!!! I didn't like Southpark. Maybe thats because I do not live in the Untited States and don't get everything. But I do love Team America. I like the \""Thunderbirds\"" like look and the humor! All music tracks in the movie are terribly funny! The best song is \""I miss you and Perl Harbour sucks\""! \""Montage\"" is also very funny! It's great that the German version includes the songs in English because otherwise it would make no sense I think! And I will never forget the \""puking scene\""! I've watched it several times and every time i lay on the ground laughing! The \""Barbie and Ken\"" like sex scene is funny in different dimensions! The look  the positions and the fact that in no movie with real actors this would have happened in the United States! :) What I din't understand was the Michael Moore self bombing sequence! Does Parker and Stone like him or not!? I remember one of them talking in\""Bowling for Columbine\""!? Maybe it's sarcastic...The oral sex scene between Gary and Spottswoode is a little bit weird! :X And it's a bit to hard for my opinion to show Kim Jong Il as a roach...It's one of the funniest films I've seen in my whole life! (Even a bit funnier than Top Secret!!! ;) )\tI have by no means lead a sheltered life whatsoever and have a collection of movies of various genre. With over 600 titles in my collection  I thought I had a few \""dogs\""  but not now. Being middle-aged I'm certain some may regard these comments as coming from someone who is closed minded or \""square\""  not so. I have spent over six years in the armed forces  worked a variety of jobs and am frequently exposed to what the media calls \""entertainment\"". Needless to say  I have a veryopen mind. Also being a non-practicing Catholic (which would probably put me in the heretic category)  I still believe in God and honestly feel it's time for Him to put His foot down (RIGHT ON TOP OF US). Bottom line is  please do not bother with this trash  I beg you. I have since thrown this movie in the trash (was tempted to burn it but feared the toxic effects) and have vocally relayed my thoughts and opinions to my work associates that would consider viewing it. I refuse to admit to any others of having even seen it let alone owned it  it's that embarrassing. BTW  this scaling does not go low enough. IMO I would have gone to -10.\tI laughed for 2 days!that's all I had to say. but apparently I need to post 10 lines. So let me also Point out that the whole \""Dirka  Dirka  Mohammed Jihad\"" thing was really well written.And the soundtrack was phenomenal: \""I need you like Ben Afflec needs acting lessons... Like Cuba Gooding Jr. needed a bigger part\"".Kim Jong Ill cracked me up. \""Your breaking my balls Hans Brix\"".\""Matt Damon\"".Don't let your kids see this movie.Graphic puppet sex scene. I can't get that image out of my head.These guys should really get jobs with the Bush Administration. They could write speeches for Rumsfeld.\tGod  I had to force myself to watch through this waste of time. Two or three decent jokes don't justify a 90 minute movie.South Park was huge fun. But this is offensive stuff. War opponents are fags  Michael Moore a socialist terrorist.And in the end moronic gung ho Americans are the heroes who save the day. A propaganda piece disguised as satire. Dim.To be fair it has some nice puppetry and some great sets  but in the end it just doesn't make up for a very weak and inconsistent script. Avoid at all cost.What a missed opportunity\t'Team America' is a breeze of freshness in a genre that seemed deeply dormant or plainly dead  since the Muppets movies back in the 80s. Also  it's the first serious comical treatment - if I may say so - that the war on terror gets  whatever you believe this means.Nobody gets clean out of the impertinent treatment of the script writers. Not the valiant American team policing the world and fighting for democracy  not the various brands of terrorists and communist dictators  and especially not the Hollywood branded liberal peace movement. Every and category of those  and more have full reasons to get angry at this film  but the viewer is the one who gets happy  with a cynical but sincere treatment of todays world and its assembly of coocoos. Sure  one needs to approach this film with an open mind  but if you do it  even the irreverent language will give you good reasons to laugh.\tFrom the beginning to the end  i was laughing non stop. As soon as you calm down from one funny bit  another one gets you going again. Not only that  but its been weeks since me and my mate saw it  yet conversation still slips to team America some how. When we've gone over the whole movie again  he asks \""what other funny movies are there\"" and we go silent in concentration. The things that make this movie so great are the songs  characters and the pure unrealistic stupidity that is a necessity when building a comedy like team America. The producers have made all the characters special and they have made them all funny. If you really listen to the songs  there's more to laugh at. PEARL HARBOUR was meant to be a sort of love song but when you listen to the lyrics  it makes fun of other actors and movies. Its a great movie that deserves 10/10. Long live team America - putting the F back in freedom\tbut imagine having thirty million dollars to make a movie and this is what you create. Think about it  $30 000 000.00! That's insane. The outrageousness and irreverence are there; it was just a little too ambitious. Mocking Hollywood and America should've been two separate film  the combination of the two didn't work for me. (On a side note  in my own script I do mock Michael Bay and Ben Affleck. I wrote this script long before I saw the movie so I don't want anyone giving me the business when they see it.) Spottswoode's character was brilliant. Anytime he discussed \""acting\"" I was on the floor.Holla!\tF---yeah! Trey Parker and Matt Stone sure did a good a job in bringing this spoof of all the Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay films in this puppet movie that's also a spoof of the cult classic marionette action TV series Thunderbirds  and at the same time  it pokes fun at all political sides  though George Bush and John Kerry were missing  crap! But still  it is funny to see them make fun of all the clich\u00e9s in action films and war on terrorism. In some ways  it does poke fun at America itself especially poking fun at how other countries see America  and make liberals look the way conservatives see them(I liked Alec Baldwin  Tim Robbins and Michael Moore puppets) and make other nations look the way some people see them. And not to mention Kim Jong Il! He was very funny with the 'Ls' and 'Rs' and his song about him being lonely. Overall this has to be the funniest Trey and Matt made next to South Park  recommended to the fans of South Park  and to those who like adult humor  the spoofs here are hilarious! F--- yeah!\tHilarious movie poking fun at the overzealous  flag-waving red-state people in our midst  while also saving their best jibes for celebrities harboring delusions of grandeur and political savvy.I must not be terribly sophisticated  because the very dumb jokes in the film had me cackling- \""Trust you? You're a butt****** quitter!\"" Or \""Jesus tit****** Christ!\"" The final speech given by Gary  I think  sums up the ideology of the filmmakers. The US may be reckless  arrogant dicks but they're far preferable to the people we fight. And the \""anti-war\"" people who oppose us EVEN after battle has been joined  are forming a de-facto alliance with the terrorists- as evidenced in the film.\tSouth Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone return to the big screen with Team America: World Police in an over the top and hilarious satire on world events and the debates raging over the war on terror.Parker and Stone manages to poke fun at almost everyone  including the U.S. by satirically showing the wanton disregard for the local population and what other people think as they go in and shoot up Paris and Egypt  perfectly illustrating the widely held cowboy mentality of American foreign policy. The film also captures the na\u00efve sense of optimism and black and white triumphalism of American foreign policy when Team America tells the French \""everything is bon\"" after destroying Paris. For Team America  the end justifies the means  and their job is to blow stuff up  police the world and catch terrorists.The two would later comment that they designed all the international sets to reflect what an American might think a place like Paris would look like  which meant a kind of Disney World version of the world. The Paris set for example had The Eiffel Tower  the Louvre and the Arch De Triumph in one small square. The cobblestone roads are made of croissant shaped stones and locations are described relative to their distance from America  showing the American inward looking self-centered attitude.Parker and Stone's politics have long been apparent in their work on South Park  spawning the term  South Park Conservatism. This new political movement is largely driven by young people who aren't wearing Che T-shirts and protesting the war in Iraq every time there is a meeting of world leaders. It can be loosely described as an opposition for political correctness  use of satire to mock established institutions and dearly held beliefs both on the left and the right  and the ridiculing of 'protected groups'. The purpose is usually to ridicule  mock and satirize the excesses and dysfunction of institutions that are often taboo to criticize.The film also includes a surprisingly insightful exchange between UN weapons inspector Hans Blix and Kim Jong-Il which skilfully illustrates the frustration many people have with the UN. In the exchange  Blix urges Kim Jong-Il to let him inspect Kim's palace for WMDs  \""or else\u0085\"" Blix threatens. \""Or else what?\"" Kim retorts. Blix's could only respond with complete seriousness the comically emasculated position of the real UN. \""\u0085or else we will be very angry with you and we will write a letter telling you how angry we are.\"" The fact that for the entire scene  Hans Blix isn't a caricature but portrayed sympathetically as a real UN bureaucrat urging Kim to let him so his job so he could \""ease the UN's collective minds\"" makes the scene even more potent in its political analysis of the UN's current problems.The greatest achievement of the film is that in its nearly two hours of political satire  and especially with the speech comparing American hawks  peaceniks and pariah states with the human reproductive anatomy  the South Park creators have delivered a clear framework for their take on the world with amazing clarity and ironic insight  upstaging the various talking heads  politicians and pundits who have done essentially nothing but scream at each other over the past few years.The other part of the Team America focuses on Parker and Stone's satire of Michael Bay's action movies and their total loathing of actors (they later mentioned that they refused to hire real actors to do the voice work because they hate all actors which they feel are too self-absorbed in their own importance). There's several amazingly sung and composed satires of genre songs in the film  including the testosterone driven \""America  F*** YEAH!\""   country tune \""Freedom Isn't Free\"" and Broadway musical \""Everyone Has Aids\"" among other songs including one berating Michael Bay and Ben Affleck's abilities (largely deserved).The decision to split the film into a dual satire between politics and action movies  especially Parker and Stone's seemingly personal vendetta against a select group of actors ultimately hurts the film. Team America loses focus in the second half and never regains it until the final minutes of the film when Gary delivers an impassioned plea to world leaders  allowing Parker and Stone's point to get across. Whatever one's political position is  and assuming the viewer isn't too old or too socially conservative to find exploding heads  swearing and puppet sex socially corrupt  Team America: World Police is a great film that delivers one of the most politically cogent post-911 world views that I've seen  read or heard anywhere. There is no room for apologists  vitriolic rants against certain countries or sensitivities for feelings of some minorities  they tell it like they see it and it works.\tWhen the world is threatened by global terrorism and the machinations of a homicidal madman who can't pronounce his Rs  the United States calls on an elite team to save the day  figures who stand tall even if that means only two feet high and suspended with puppet wires.\""Team America: World Police\"" takes the threat of al-Qaeda and global qualms about the U.S. promoting order and poke acerbic  crude fun at the whole thing  replacing actors with marionettes and reducing everything to one-third life size. Director Trey Parker and his writing partner Matt Stone prove that even 9/11 won't get in the way of a good gay or poop joke. It's one way to strike a blow for freedom  though not a guarantee of great comedy  even for the \""South Park\"" gang.I admit I watched \""South Park: Bigger  Longer  And Uncut\"" six years ago with the hope I wouldn't like it. The series was a guilty pleasure  but the review in Entertainment Weekly made the movie sound like the greatest satire ever filmed  something I found irksome. To my short-sighted disappointment  the film was great  one of those rare movies that made you laugh from beginning to end  yet gave you ideas to chew on about censorship and obscenity  not to mention some super songs.I was disappointed seeing \""Team America \"" too  for a completely different reason. This time I was rooting for Parker and Stone  especially after they took early heat from the Left despite the fact they clearly made fun of the neo-cons  too. Alas  this time it WAS a disappointment. The songs here are funny  if not as melodically solid as with \""South Park\"" \u0096 \""Up There\"" would be a killer number in any musical. The humor starts out strong but wilts after ten minutes  giving you moments here and there but a lot of dead air  too. Maurice LaMarche nails Alec Baldwin  though that also points up the weakness in Parker and Stone's voice work playing everyone else. Worst of all  I never got the sense there was any underlying point to this film  to all the vulgarity and crudity being poured onto my lap  other than Parker and Stone wanting to show they had the cahones to do it.Even the funniest moments have weaknesses. When we first meet Gary Johnston  the main character  he is performing in the Broadway musical \""Lease\"" with a showstopper finale: \""Everyone Has AIDS.\"" That provides anti-PC humor at its best [\""My grandma and my dog Ole Blue/The Pope has got it and so do you/C'mon everybody we got quiltin' to do\""] but not exactly freshest; the red AIDS ribbon that rises up off the stage like a disco ball feels like a '90s throwback because it is  just like the Jerry Bruckheimer movies that the film parodies throughout.When the material is more currant  it's scarcely better. I admire any movie made in 2004 that makes fun of Michael Moore  but the satirists can't manage to do anything more with him than blow him up  which not only misses the point of Moore's cultural relevance but makes him more heroic than anything else  someone willing to die for his convictions rather than make money off them. Similarly  the assorted killing of left-leaning movie stars (as well as people like Liv Tyler and Samuel L. Jackson  who aren't especially political but apparently fun to kill in the Parker/Stone mindset) has zero satirical value and just bogs down the story.The anti-PC vibe in \""Bigger  Longer And Uncut\"" was a source of strength. Here  it feels dated. Having Kim Jong-Il talk like a Catskills impersonation from the 1950s works for a minute  but it doesn't go anywhere  and his \""I'm So Ronree\"" number sags from beginning to end.That said  the film does make you laugh  and the puppet production work is ingenious enough to make the film worth seeing for that alone. But given the heavy issues it plays with  and the comedic talent involved  I had hopes for something more than a middling  infantile comedy that presents swearing puppets and scatological sex as cutting-edge comedy.\tTo get it off my chest  I *like* South Park. I loved the SP movie. Don't get me wrong  I \""get\"" Matt and Trey's brand of humor. However  TA just couldn't do anything for me in the least. It's not funny  not especially well-written  and  worst of all  boring.I know I probably won't change any die-hard fans' minds  but I really don't see the humor in this. The plot is paper-thin at best  and there aren't a whole lot of jokes worth laughing over. Most of the \""humor\"" comes from the fact that it's puppets doing all this crazy action stuff. But after the first 15 min.  the novelty of that wears off and we're left with a pretty weak action-adventure comedy.The problem with doing an action-adventure with puppets is that they're not very mobile. Sure  the set piece in France *should* have been funny  but because the puppets shamble reaaaallly slowwwllly  any energy is drained out of the scene. This problem gets terrible when there's a supposed fist-fight between on TA-er (Chris?) and Sam Jackson  but I couldn't even tell what was going on. Maybe if it was a full cartoon this could have worked. Instead  it's just really really draggy.The actual plot fails as a satire  because it doesn't even know what to satirize. The liberal activists barely act like their real counterparts  and neither do the pro-war on terror characters. It's like Matt and Trey tried to make a movie and remain as ignorant as possible about what they were 'satirizing.' The constant swearing sounds like a 10 year old who just learned some dirty words. It's used almost without any real reason  aside from the fact you're supposed to find it funny that a puppet swears. Same thing with the FAG joke....by the 60th time you hear that joke  you realize it wasn't ever funny to begin with.But I did like the song \""America  F*ck Yeah!\"" That gets 3 stars.\tI should have known not to rent this movie when I knew it was from the creators of South Park. The movie actually started out great and I loved the puppetry work  but the constant and unneeded swearing did not add anything to the movie. The theme song throughout the movie \""Team America @!&@ Yeah\"" got real old real quick. There was also a sex scene in the uncut version which was funny in the beginning and then got downright disgusting. Once again the creators of South Park disappoint. If they had taken out the constant swearing and had toned down some of the scenes it would have been an OK movie (but then again fans would say it wouldn't be a movie from the South Park creators).Warning: Do not rent this movie if you have kids!\tTruly one of the least intelligent movies I have had the misery of actually sitting through. The humor was primarily vulgar  rarely funny  unintelligent and not incredibly subtle as some might suggest. If only I could have known  now I don't get back that hour and a half of my life. I do find it an impressive achievement that they did not rely on computers to add to the content of the movie. Unfortunately  that does not excuse the lack of creative thought and attention to what an audience may actually desire; a comedy. To subject them to a puppet drama with limited scope of thought seems to be a bit of a travesty. However  I am sure that loyal followers of South Park hailed this movie as creative genius and for that I say  Trey Parker can laugh all the way to the bank.\tThis movie is rated R for graphic crude and sexual humor  violent images  and strong language \u0096 all involving puppets. And this is no exaggeration. Team America: World Police is a dirty  low  sick  and mostly unfunny movie that spoofs terrorism and the way today's societies work.I'll say right now that I enjoyed the first part of the movie. I found it to be funny (for the most part) and nice. But the last bit of the movie is so disgusting and vulgar  that I tried to figure out what went wrong with Trey Parker and Matt Stone's brain. You might say that it is rather harsh of me to bring a movie's rating down so far when it was the ending that really killed me. I believe a lot of the movie relies on how it ends. I didn't much like War of the Worlds because I thought the ending was annoying  yet I give it a C+ because it still had some good sequences. This train wreck has nothing strikingly memorable  unless you count Kim Jong Il's solo  I'm So Ronery.I did find the whole \""America is infatuated with itself\"" theme funny. Team America is an independent organization that fights terrorism. In the movie's opening sequence  they destroy about half of Paris in an attempt to catch four terrorists; in another sequence  they manage to destroy the pyramids and the Sphinx.The main character is Gary  a Broadway actor who stars in the play Lease and seems to have the ability to reduce audiences to tears. Team America's leader  Spottswoode  employs Gary to disguise himself as a terrorist and infiltrate their hideout in Egypt. Though the mission is successful  the destruction they leave behind causes protests (one outside the base  a hollowed out Mt. Rushmore  is lead by Michael Moore)  which eventually leads to the capture of Team America's team and the destruction of their base. (When their computer is destroyed  with is called I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E  they yell  \""We have no I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E).The marionettes are interesting to look at  but they eventually grow tiresome  and you start wishing for some South Park animation to butt in. The marionettes do provide some funny looking imitations of such famous actors as Sean Penn (who wrote an angry letter to Parker and Stone after the movie's release)  Alec Baldwin  Susan Sarandon  Tim Robbins  and Helen Hunt  among others. They are all members of the Film Actors Guild (F.A.G)  and their soul purposes in the movie is to oppose Team America  and be ridiculed & killed.Of course  I'm not a big fan of Trey Parker or Matt Stone anyway. But I have seen the South Park movie  and found it to be a little vulgar  but still intelligent and fun (B-). I just wasn't ready for the vulgarity of this movie  and so I just have to give it low marks. Ebert pointed out that this movie pretty much insults everything about the war on terrorism; from the terrorists to the way we act. They pretty much target everyone. My question: will they ever put themselves under ridicule in their own movies  like they do so many others?I hope they do. In the meantime  Team America: World Police offended me and so I do not think it deserves more then what I have given it. I just hope Parker and Stone's next movie is smarter then this one; they should look back on their South Park movie and take some pointers.\tTeam America: World Police was one of the first movies I wanted to see in 2004  but never had the time to see it. So I finally rented it last night and watched it. The movie is hilarious on all levels. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are excellent comedians who are the creators behind South Park. There were a couple scenes in the movie that made me die laughing such as the puppet sex scene  the Korean ruler's song \""I am so lonely\""  the killing of the actors guild  and many others. How the puppets moved  talked  and killed was hilarious. Nearly the whole movie I laughed. Overall  Team America: World Police is an enjoyable satire that is highly entertaining . Trey Parker and Matt Stone are good! I highly recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 8.5/10 ***+ B+"""
The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005),"AFter receiving free-passes to a screening of the 40 yr old virgin  I wasn't expecting much  but was very pleasantly surprised. This movie had me in tears in several places from laughing so hard. There's a fair amount of swearing  drug references and some nudity  but the story is good  the jokes are non-stop and hilarious. I highly recommend it. You'll notice some familiar faces if you've seen Steve Carell in other movies like Anchorman. In Virgin  he re-teams with Paul Rudd  as a co-worker in an electronics store  as well as Seth Rogan. Ca There's a cameo from David Koechner (Anchorman) and Nancy Walls (Daily Show  SNL).\tI haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time. I got to go to an advance screening  and was thrilled because I had been dying to see it. I had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie. The audience all shared my laughter  and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie.Kudos to Steve Carrell(who I had already been a fan of). He proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy. He has a style that I haven't seen before. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always. Thank God there wasn't a cameo from Will Ferrell(love him  but saw him too much this summer).There were parts of comedic genius in this movie. Partly thanks to Carrell  and partly thanks to the writing(also Carrell). The waxing scene and the speed dater with the \obvious problem\"" were absolutely hysterical.I will definitely go see '40 Year Old Virgin' when it's released. My advice: go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it.\tI was really surprised with this movie. Going in to the sneak preview  knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I'd seen  I thought it was going to be a Dude Where's My Car kind of crap fest. I was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work. Instead I got a smart  surprisingly original movie about a decent  average guy who just never had sex.Yes  the film is chock full o' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-a-nipple!  but it's done much in the spirit of Bad Santa rather than Sorority Boys. All the characters are people you probably know in real life  redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives.I went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap  and I was very surprised. Yea  it's pretty over the top (c'mon  it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin!)  but it's very smartly done.In the end  you're really pulling for this guy to get laid  which says a lot about the movie because honestly  did you really care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?\tJust came out of a sneak preview for this film. It had me laughing every 30 secs. The ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing I hadn't bought that large coke. There are definitely some lulls  but  overall  highly entertaining. The movie lets Steve Carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both Jim Carrey in \""Bruce Almighty\"" and Will Ferrell \""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy\"" in their movies. Paul Rudd is hilarious as always. I love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas (like P.S.). I think that Seth Rogen should be getting more work  because he so freaking talented and engaging. Leslie Mann also had some incredibly funny moments. I highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac. However  if you're easily offended  don't see this movie. If you're a rabid feminist  don't see this movie. And  please  not matter what  even if you think you're one of those \""hip\"" parents  don't take your kids to this movie. Sure  you should let your teens go see this movie  just don't watch it with them. It would make for some incredibly awkward moments.\tAll right  here's the deal: if you're easily offended then you might want to stay far  far away from this one. There are some painfully funny moments in the movie  but I probably blushed about as much as I laughed. Actually  I probably blushed MORE than I laughed. And if I wasn't literally blushing on the outside  then I was blushing on the inside. If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame. Whether that's a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder I suppose.I will not deny that I laughed quite a bit  but this is a movie that I simply cannot give a blanket recommendation due to its subject matter. If I were to say  \""This movie is hilarious  go check it out!\"" and some sweet  little old church-going lady heads to the theater and has a heart-attack during one of the graphically explicit sex situations  well  that's just something I don't need on my conscience.So how raunchy is it? Hmm  try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers. Honestly. My mom would've walked out during the first scene. I feel it's my duty to at least warn you of what to expect.There is some cleverly intelligent comedy here  but that's what I come to expect from the man (Judd Apatow) who had a hand in both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. I'm all for making fun of Michael McDonald; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for his money. Paul Rudd proclaiming  \""If I hear Ya Mo Be There one more time I'll Ya Mo burn this place down \"" is hilarious  but it's one of those things that the majority of the audience won't appreciate.And when we see a quick 3-second flashback of Steve Carrell singing along to Cameo's Word Up  I laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over  whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about it.Strangely enough  despite the raunch  there's an admirable moral to the story. The movie doesn't portray Carrell as some freaky loser just because he's a virgin. He's really portrayed as a likable  admirable character. Sure  he's a little weird. After all  he has a framed Asia poster  \""more videogames than an Asian kid \"" and a toy collection that features the Million Dollar Man's BOSS  but we're never led to believe that there's actually anything wrong with the fact that he's a virgin. As odd as it may seem  there's a bit of an \""it's OK to wait\"" message.But man  oh man  please be warned that this pushes its R rating about as far as it can go. That was certainly Apatow's intention. According to him  he just let some of the guys (particularly Rogen and Malco) improv and talk the way they normally talk  all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty. If you can handle that or talk that way yourself  then you'll love the movie.I'm not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes. I find that subtle  clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the f-word or fratboy sex discussions. But that's me. Like I said  there are some absolutely hysterical moments here  but you have to ask yourself if they're worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you're likely to ever see at the theater. I just don't know how interested most women will be in what's discussed by men while playing poker. Honestly ladies  you might not want to know. If you've ever been curious why some girls think guys are gross  well  this gives you a good idea.There you go - my humble  honest take on what to expect. Be that your guide. It definitely should not be seen with your Sunday School class  mama  grandmama  any family members of the opposite sex  children of any age  or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion. If you'd see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it means to be uncomfortable.\tBeing a virgin was best for Christ's mother  but losing virginity is a right of passage for most American males. For Steve Carell's Andy Stitzer it's a nightmare he has avoided for 40 years. He's a reluctant virgin traumatized by more than one aggressive girl in his youth  but his buddies think his time has come. Thus begins a tortuous journey to love and maturity for an electronics store salesman whose idea of a good time is making a perfect omelet or rearranging his perfectly stored action figures.I thought \""Must Love Dogs\"" with John Cusack and Diane Lane was the best romantic comedy of the summer  and more than I hoped for. But Virgin goes beyond just middle-aged dating; it explores the value of holding out for a higher level of meaning when engaging in sex;  and it satirizes the social norms that foster promiscuity. Ultimately it settles on the right mixture represented by Carell and his business neighbor  Catherine Keener's Trish.Along the way is some insightful writing  often delivered with understated irony  by Andy and his two buddies. For instance  those who haunt video stores for offbeat memories know immediately that when Andy is counseled to be tough like David Caruso in Jade  the writers are geeky and knowing. The setup in the waxing salon  with Carell actually having his chest hair torn off and bleeding  reminds me of the outtakes of Peter Sellers as Chauncey Gardner in \""Being There \"" where he keeps trying to swear but ends up blowing the scene because he finds himself amusingly out of place. Andy swears at each rip of the adhesive  each time funnier than the last.This is my first experience with Steve Carell; I hope it won't be the last. The same can be said of first time director Judd Apatow. Both are not virgins when it comes to delivering sophisticated comedy.\tThis movie was one of the best movies that I have seen this year. I didn't see any cameos in the movie  but it is still pretty good. It is similar to Anchorman in the humor department  but I think this is a better put together movie. It actually has a point. If you are going to see a whole bunch of T&A you will be disappointed. Just a well put together movie!!!! If you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor  you will find this to be a really good movie. I definitely think that Ebert and Roeper's review of this movie is right on. I mean  I don't really like Ebert on most movies  but this is the movie that I will agree about. The movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there. There is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie. Yea  sure  you get laughed at when it is found out about  but it still suggests that you wait. Steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet  it is still funny.\tI wanted to see this based on all the favorable reviews. I have to remember in the future that most reviewers are male. A man might find the excessive vulgarity and profanity funnier than I did. The 18-25 year old males will undoubtedly love this film. This movie is rated R and it is about a 40 year old virgin  but funny shouldn't mean four letter words in practically every scene. To be honest  some of the male talk left me in the dark. I guess you have to be a guy to know the 'guy speak'. I was expecting sharper dialogue  humor based more on observation. There are a few good one liners  but I wished for more. In the showing I saw  I imagine the 65-70 old woman in front of me was cringing a good deal of the time. Some scenes made 'me' uncomfortable. I'm guessing this movie will play better for men than most women.Steve Carell  so good in NBC's show \""the Office\""  is equally excellent here. I was surprised at his range. He never makes Andy seem dorky  just a little out of the loop when it comes to women. His performance saves the film. The supporting characters are all excellent. I wish they had been given less raunchy material. I still give this movie a thumbs up  but with reservations  especially if you're easily offended.\tThis movie has the same boring jokes over and over again in a 5 minute loop. Yeah  I would have liked this when I was 14  but those days are long gone. All I can say is that I am scared that anyone over the age of 14 actually liked this movie. Seriously  wow. This is an embarrassment to the world of comedy  reminiscent of Without A Paddle  and makes any Jim Carrey movie ever made look like pure genius. What I thought would be funny for the first 15 minutes of this movie turned out to be not only the first 15 minutes  but the entire movie in a loop. No evolution of thought  character  or jokes. Simply the same penis-oriented garbage from one scene to another. So yeah  if you laugh every time you hear the word penis  go ahead and see this movie  otherwise look for a comedy with some thought put into it.\tI expected this movie to be good  and it was better. It was excellent. From beginning to end  it was hilarious. Non-stop f-bombs and sexual content is my kind of movie. Believe me  you wont be disappointed to see the 40 year old virgin. i cant really imagine a person who cannot like this movie. The waxing was awesome  and the condom scene was funny as all hell. Not really much else to say except  see it now! Screw the other movies that just came out  especially the August 12th line-up. This is in the same category as Wedding Crashers to me  probably a little bit more funnier but pretty damn close to the same. So  if you liked movies the Wedding Crashers  see this. It's even 2 hours long  and those 2 hours aren't boring  every bit is f*cking hilarious! 10/10\tThis is the second movie to exceed my expectations in the last few weeks. The trailers left me wondering whether this movie would be worth watching at all. Plus  I loved Steve Carell on the Daily Show  but I found his movies lacking  but he was never the star. Here  he has a writing credit. His performances are getting better as his roles expand. Much to my surprise  they pulled it off after all  to an interesting  and unexpected closing after the closing which adds a significant element of sweetness to the story.The subject of the movie is more serious than the comedy this is billed to be. Andy Stitzer (Carell) is the virgin because he \""choses to be\""; actually  because he's socially inept and afraid of the opposite sex. I was wondering how he would break the news to his girlfriend in the movie  who eschews sex with him  apparently to avoid the pressure.The supporting cast is a hoot  the dialog is well written  and entirely believable  as crazy as his co-workers seemed to be. We've all had them. I also loved the interesting choice of music  which adds an interesting layer to the movie one doesn't usually notice.Not the funniest movie of the year  as some reviewers say  because it isn't intended to be  considering the subject which needed to be dealt with seriously and not frivolously. It is good story with funny parts  and I highly recommend it.\tThis movie is damn good comedy! I saw Wedding Crashers and thought it was hilarious  but this movie blows it out of the water.By the way  I am an educated  intelligent thirty one year old woman who enjoys a good laugh. Do I like being referred to as a \""bitch\""? No! But come on ladies and gents  that's how it is. Back to the movie...The laughs just keep coming and coming and.... er  uh  no pun intended? I missed dialog because all of us were laughing so freeking hard! Though unlike typical Hollywood BS endings  40 year old Virgin saves the best laugh for last. I have already planned on buying the DVD.Thank you guys - writers  actors  director  set designers  soundtrack makers  and everyone who took part in putting this piece of work together - for making the $23.00 I spent  just on myself  worthwhile. Just in case you were wondering  I went with friends  and no  am not a virgin.A must see for all ages! Well  puberty and up at least! You have to see this movie! Go tonight! Take a date! Go now!\tThis review is not meant to edify the reader's knowledge of what actually takes place in the movie. It is merely meant to advocate the legitimacy of this film as a rare comedic stand-out in an era when Hollywood studios care more about the financial bottom-line than actually engaging their audiences. At a time when the film industry is treating its patrons like HMOs do their patients  it is refreshing to have been able to view a movie that does not sacrifice quality nor demean my intelligence by pandering to conventionally uninspired adult humor. This film is well thought-out and will probably do a tremendous amount of business because it was well-crafted as opposed to the pre-packaged  formulaic soft sell approach of most comedic films today. As a 32 year-old  it was also refreshing to watch a film containing characters who are my age-mates  as opposed to another flaccid youth-obsessed teen movie. The fact that Steve Carell also co-wrote and executive-produced this movie not only makes \""The 40-Year Old Virgin\"" a tremendous personal achievement  but explains its artistic success  as well.\tThis movie was extremely bad  not in terms of actually making the film (acting  cinematography  editing  directing). The movie was extremely poor in the quality  portrayal  and meaning of the story. The movie could have been so much better without all of the meaningless curse words. Of course  this is a rated R feature  and I can see that they were pushing it to be rated R  but a lot of the cursing and various pornographic images and words that were put in there  did not need to be used either. It seemed that this movie was made just to do that  to put all of those words that did not need to be there. I will hand this to them  the movie was funny in some parts  I really did laugh...but most of it was just sick words and bad content. I was really disappointed because I knew that this movie was from the producer of Anchorman and I thought that Anchorman was a really good  classic comedy. This was too  because it ends in a wedding  however  it just seemed very strange when watching it and I really do not recommend going to see it. This movie still could have been funny without all of the curse words and pornographic images in it.\tThis is the movie all actors dream of  a comic performance that can make them a movie star. That is what 40 Year Old Virgin is to Carrell. Not only is the film hilarious it has a good natured spirit this is missing from most sex comedies. This movie has a message and it makes you feel good. This is more than a gross out comedy. The problem with a lot of adult comedies is there is no soul  this movie brings i the heart. I loved and I want to see it again and again. Another highlight of this film is the wonderful supporting cast  Paul Rudd and Catherin Keener are in particular very strong. However  the entire cast is a fabulous ensemble.I highly recommend this film to everyone. I believe this is the movie that will showcase Steve Carrell just like with Steve Martin in the Jerk and Jim Carrey in Ace Ventura. I have suddenly become a huge Steve Carrell fan!\tThe 40 Year Old Virgin stars Steve Carrell in pretty much a rehashing of Brick from anchorman. the first 30 minutes or so of the movie were about the least funny minutes in any comedy i've seen in theaters (i say *in theaters* because for some reason i watched \""Guess who\"" on DVD... and that whole movie was pretty much the least funny comedy i've ever seen). The whole movie was filled with nothing but poorly written  uncreative  and vulgar cheap laughs. i.e. the old Pakistani guy rambling on about sex acts. nothing remotely witty about it. in all i'd say the last half hour or so and the waxing scene were the only parts worth seeing. there was a small amount of funniness throughout that barely kept the movie going along at a decent pace. but in all  this certainly wasn't the best comedy of the summer. the humor in it is supposed to be shocking or whatever... but saying: sh-t  fu-k  pus-y  co-k  b-ner  etc. really isn't shocking to anyone outside of Jr high schoolers and parents. in summation... it is a movie full of cheap laughs and uncreative to the bone  but a few scenes make it worth it if you're really bored and hard up for a laugh.\tI read several reviews of this movie before I went to see it  and was just not prepared for how incredibly raunchy the language was  how incredibly raunchy the situations were  etc. I can see how it could have been a wonderfully touching  funny movie  if the language hadn't been so just plain awful. (Sexual language that  if I tried to warn you of what I mean  the IMDb would not allow me to put it in writing!) The only reason I am writing this review is to let parents know: UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES LET YOUR TEENAGERS SEE THIS MOVIE! However  perhaps you as parents should watch it to see what Hollywood is wanting your children to see (to emulate). Frankly  I'm surprised it was just an R rating.\tI got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and didn't know  what to expect. The premise seemed silly and I assumed it would be a  lot of shallow make-fun-of-the-virgin humor. What a great surprise. I  laughed so hard I cried at some of the jokes. This film is a must see  for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor.  OK.....this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother (Jack  Palance?) or small children. The language is filthy  the jokes are  (very) crude  and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find  anywhere. What's amazing  however  is that the movie is still a sweet  love story. My girlfriend and I both loved it.  Steve Carell is terrific  but (like The Office) the supporting cast  really makes the film work. All of the characters have their flaws  but  they also have depth and likability. Everyone pulls their weight and  the chemistry is perfect.  I can't wait to get the DVD. I'm sure it will be up there with Office  Space for replays and quotable lines.\t(Synopsis) 40-year old Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) has gone his entire life without being with a woman in bed. His friends at the electronics store where he works as an inventory clerk want to correct that situation. They make it their mission to find Andy a woman. They believe it will happen when Andy meets Trish (Catherine Keener)  a 40-year old single mother of three  who runs a business across the street from his job. Unfortunately  Andy and Trish begin their relationship with a no-physical contact agreement until after they have had 20 dates.(Comment) This is one hilarious movie  with non-stop laughter. The target audience for this movie with its graphic discussion about sex  drugs  and dirty language is adult men. I laughed from beginning to end. There are several scenes where I laughed so hard it brought tears to my eyes. Carell's character is a likable one and so innocent that you will root for him to succeed. The subject matter may offend some women  so this is not a date movie  and surely don't take the kids. (Universal Pictures  Run time 1:56  Rated R)(6/10)\tThis is a great movie for both men and women! I agree with it's \""R\"" rating  due to foul language and sexual talk/innuendo  but none of it takes away from the movie itself. You will thoroughly enjoy this movie whether on a date or out with a few friends. This movie has sweet moments along with laugh out loud moments that will make you second guess your desire to take a drink of soda; you may end up spitting it on the person in front of you as you burst out laughing at the many hilarious moments this movie provides. During a time when the movie industry may put out only one good comedy a year  this year we've been blessed with two outrageous ones - The Wedding Crashers (an absolute MUST SEE) and The 40 Year Old Virgin. So  grab your significant other or a group of friends and treat yourself to an extremely laughable good time."""
The Aristocrats (2005),"It's a good doc. It has a good idea. Particularly memorable are the mime and Sarah Silverman. The mime's performance is his first since retiring from miming beginning in the seventies. Sarah is simply hilarious. Still  the other comedians hold their own. George Carlin tells the joke well. Paul Reiser does a good job too. Check it out. It really is quite amusing. I have submitted ten lines of text yet \there are still problems with my comment\"". How much do I have to say? It was a successful premiere with good commentary by the producers and director before the show. It also had a good audience reaction. And it had a kick-ass party. The movie features hella talented comedians. Do I need to say more?\tNot since Lenny Bruce has something been simultaneously so profane and so profound.I laughed 'til I cried  numerous times.I am thrilled that I live in a country where I can sit in a theatre and watch a movie where people say whatever they want.Did I mention that I laughed a lot?Sarah Silverman  Gilbert Gottfried  Dana Gould  Billy the Mime  and Otto and George are standouts in a stellar cast.If you like films like Herbie: Fully Loaded and Rebound  then you may want to steer clear of this one.This film is disgusting  hilarious  offensive  hysterical  and patriotic.Much like your mom.\tWhat can one say of this film? Any adjective would be an understatement. It is great how this stellar cast plays together and builds this story yet brings their own experience to the mix. The use of imagination is nothing short of genius. It works on all levels from the ground up. The pictures painted by the performers are so vivid and captivating that you can't help but to experience it as if you were there. A classic tale of struggle and opportunity. A whirlwind ride for the whole family. Something for everyone. It's great to see a timeless treasure  such as this story  finally shared with the world. I would definitely see this again. There is just so much to absorb. It would take a plethora of paper towels to do the job. A most uplifting experience.\tI heard things I never thought I would ever hear in a movie theater. And  while hearing them  expected people - especially women  of whom there was a whole row behind me and who constituted about a third of the three-quarter-full NYC house - to start walking out. Nobody did  that I saw  and the women behind me guffawed along with everyone else  perhaps a bit subdued when really crude references to female body parts were spoken. And everyone applauded at the end.There is really no good way for me to describe this movie  which caused me to laugh more than I ever have in a movie theater  except to say that it is to no-holds-barred humor what a featurette about the making of Tarantino's \""Kill Bill\"" films would be to exaggerated  bloody  cartoon-like martial-arts violence. It's an inside look at comedy and comedians that the general public rarely if ever gets to see.This movie is not for the faint-hearted  squeamish or easily offended. And it's definitely not a date movie  unless your date is a professional stand-up comedian or wants to be one.\tIt's filthy  it's real. It's not something to watch for a punchline it's something to watch for the realism of the oldest most told joke in the comedy network. Just enjoy all the personalities and what they bring. Honestly  for me it was very enjoyable and it hit home with my sense of humor. Probably not for everyone but it's only an hour and half  just take chance you'll laugh a few times for sure then you can complain how bad it was later. Bob Saget and Kevin Pollack  priceless! Enjoy it for the comics. Enjoy it for the raunchiness (is that a word). Enjoy it for what it is  don't read into it and next time you're around a bunch of comic's listen and relate. I like how it brings this to our generation of comic's  great job guys!\tYes  I am guilty. I just lied through my teeth and took a 16 year old to \""The Aristrocrats.\"" We did not sit in the front row and talk through the movie because we were both laughing too hard. I think he was taking notes on some of the new \""vocabulary words \"" as well.We loved it. I can't imagine being offended-the joke is a \""morality play.\"" The whole point is how absolutely \""wrong \"" \""perverse \"" \""against the codes of \""normal\"" behavior a Vaudeville act can be (Hello  reality TV. A point made in the film.) to culminate with a punchline that seems to indicate \""correct\"" or \""proper.\"" The individual interpretations (Carrie Fisher using her parents? OMIGAWD. Sarah Silverman's Parker-Posy-Waiting-For-Guffman version? The kids of South Park (timing is everything) not getting the joke? And yes  Gilbert Gottfried and Bob Saget are my new heroes.On a personal note  I was especially happy to see \""Otto and George.\"" George was looking less healthy than Otto  for a change. And at least the kid didn't leave the theater chanting the term \""Stanky Pussy.\"" Well  until I told him about seeing Otto and George live  anyway.THANK YOU!\tThe problem with this movie is that it ceases to be funny once the premise is revealed. The joke gets really dirty---get it? Now listen for another hour and a half as comedians say all of the dirty things you already thought up when you reached your \""obscenity maturity\"" at around  oh  eighteen. Incest  various sexual positions  feces  etc.Those things are funny when you aren't expecting them. For example  in the South Park movie  I remember actually being surprised at how many obscenities were invoked in the \""Terrence and Phillip\"" movie-within-a-movie. It was a cinematic first for me  and I laughed.But in this movie  once you have heard a fairly dirty version of this joke  you are expecting anything and everything. In fact  the only funny version of the joke (in my opinion) was told by the South Park characters in the second half of the movie. It was funny because it invoked something that was actually surprising--in other words  something that probably even offended some people who came to the movie knowing for the most part what it was about.Other than that  the only interesting aspect of this movie was that it served as an unwitting empirical investigation into the self-indulgence and self-aggrandizement of the stand-up world.Another user's comment reminded me of a thought I had during the movie--that this whole thing might be a hoax  a joke perpetrated on America to see how many people would laugh at something so clearly not funny. In fact  during the movie I kept wondering if we weren't going to all be told at the end  \""Gotcha! Shhh...pass it on!\"" That would at least explain A.O. Scott's (NY Times) ridiculously positive review. Needless to say  we weren't.But hoax or no hoax  since this is a review of the movie  I guess my comments stand--it was irritating.\tFor all its over-the-top vulgarity -- with large helpings of pornography  scatology  and incest -- \""The Aristocrats\"" is fundamentally an intelligent and affectionate film. One gifted comedian after another dives into the time-honored muck of this joke  keen on retrieving the filthiest possible diamond from the sludge. The result is some of the most hilarious film-making of recent years.It's difficult to select just a few favorites from this assemblage. Bob Saget is surely the most startling (and one of the funniest). George Carlin offers both great humor and insight into joke telling. Sarah Silverman's deadpan first-person account is unforgettable  and Gilbert Gottfried's post-9/11 version is a jewel. Billy the Mime has riotous sexual encounters with various invisible family members. Only a few comedians misfire: perhaps most notably  a guy who tries to pull off a \""clean\"" Jerry Lewis sort of physical comedy routine.And this is the paradox of the both the joke and the movie: clean versions just don't work. The hilarity comes from the clash between the pornography and the punchline  the comedic brilliance and the carefully crafted vulgarities.90 minutes on one joke may seem like overkill  but the film skillfully avoids monotony. The broader subject matter is the art of comedy: the comedians' insights are fascinating and their enthusiasm is endearing.Two minor complaints. First  it would have been helpful to identify each comedian *during* the film  not just during the (excellent) closing credits. Second -- and more seriously -- some of the camera-work was intrusive and distracting  with rapid MTV cutting that flipped back and forth between full-face and profile shots. This got so bad at one point that I had to look away from the screen until the segment was over.9/10. A masterpiece of filthy good cheer.\tThis seems like an \""Andy Kaufman\"" type of joke.By that I mean the joke is on the viewer by sucking them into a make believe world that was created by the comedian. This was the genius of Andy Kaufman and the fine line he eventually went over leading to his  in my opinion  insanity.The jazz riff analogy is a good cover to generate interest for the comedians and for the viewers. I doubt that this joke has been around for many years. The groundwork for the joke was probably laid out maybe 4-5 years ago. The fact that the groundwork was laid so many years ago for the eventual joke payoff years later is itself genius.The bottom line is that it does prove that \""words still have power.\"" Thank you Penn!\tOne of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. If you're not familiar with the joke  that's fine. If you are  you'll probably enjoy this movie on an entirely different level (which may or may not be better).Whatever the case may be  be prepared to laugh to the point of crying and in some cases  sides aching.Now  be forewarned... this movie is not rated  and is about the most disgusting joke ever told. If you're a prude  you'll probably walk out like the stuck up couple who left the theater about 10 minutes into the screening I was at tonight.There are some howling moments  there are some painfully unfunny moments  but overall  I can't recall laughing this much in a theater since seeing There's Something About Mary. This is an exercise in 1st Amendment rights (this movie would have been shut down in the days of Lenny Bruce). If you think 97 minutes of various comedians doing their versions of the same joke won't work  you're in for a surprise. This movie has so much more than that... It shows a real affection for comedy and comic performers. I have to see it again  there were so many jokes I missed  either because of other people laughing or because I was laughing to hard to hear.If you love stand-up comedy (or just enjoy laughing) and aren't easily offended  you must see this movie. You'll laugh your ass off.\tJust saw the flick tonight at Arclight in Hollywood. Director Paul Provenza came out and did some Q&A with the audience afterward. Apparently he's been putting this thing together for five years. Paul  it certainly was worth it. Probably the most entertainment and fun you'll ever get from any documentary  ever. Period.I've heard often times people talking about the \""magic\"" of comedy. It shouldn't be deconstructed or explained; either you \""get it\"" or you \""don't get it.\"" Along these same lines  comedy cannot be taught. Either you are born funny  or you're not. In my opinion  that is a load  sir.This film manages to explain quite a lot about the practice of comedy (by showing  not telling)  all the while being very  very entertaining  and very  very filthy. No sex or violence appears in the film: just people talking. But what glorious filth they talk.Simple idea for a documentary: dozens of comedians tell one of the oldest  dirtiest jokes of all time. The thing that makes the joke both a lousy joke and a template for great comedy is that its middle section is completely open to interpretation by the teller. The only mandatory parts are the opening sentence and the punchline. It's a like a comedic Rorschach test; a tabula rasa upon which each comedian imprints his own particular comic style; be it aggressive  sarcastic  dry  cynical  deconstructive  campy  bloviating  offended  angry  apologetic  or totally unconnected with reality (viz Emo Philips and Steven Wright). The editing is excellent  with juxtapositions of various comedians' thoughts coming together to bring forth several themes throughout the film.This film is comfortably in the great American tradition of rampant ribaldry and scatology first expounded by Benjamin Franklin  in his classic essay  \""Fart Proudly.\"" (That's not a joke. Franklin really did write such an essay.)So if you want to get some insight into the craft of comedy  or you just want some down-and-dirty entertainment  this is one of the best ways to spend some time in the company of sharp comic minds riffing away. At more than one point the movie makes the comparison between comedians and jazz musicians improvising  and this makes sense: jazz and stand-up comedy are two of the most lasting forms of entertainment given to the world by American culture. This is a very entertaining movie. What do I call such a movie? The Aristocrats!\tA good documentary with some very funny moments. While the retelling of the joke itself *may* get tiresome  it is the variations and \""riffs\"" on it that got themost laughs (from me anyway). Gilbert Gotfried reacting as a real person might to the act \""MY GOD! WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING???\"" had me on the floor. A joke about three African American women which utilizes two of the most offensive works in the English language  and Sarah Silverman doing a monologue as if she was once the daughter in the act are also highlights.The funniest line in the film belongs to Sarah  and you kind of have to know who Joe Franklin is to appreciate it.Gilbert Gotfried's telling of the joke to an audience in New York City three weeks after 9/11 is remarkable. It is a brilliant cathartic meltdown for the audience at the Friars Club roast where Gotfried is telling the story. Check this one out.\tThe Aristocrats uses a warhorse joke to give the audience a window into humor  obscenity  and the American conscience. I am not aware of another study capable of inducing such laughter. The premise is devilishly simple and almost a modern version of comedia delarte. This allows some of the best American comic minds to muse wildly about humor. A great achievement of the movie is the raw footage of a who's who of comedians. Comic greats such as George Carlin  Eric Idle  Whoopi Goldberg  Gilbert Godfrey  Jason Alexander  Robin Williams  Phyllis Diller  Drew Carey  Sarah Silverman  and many more weigh in on how comedians put their signature on jokes.The editing and pacing of the movie insure that the audience goes no longer than two minutes without a good laugh. There is no shortage of obscenity and lewdness in the film. The Aristocrats is not a family film. However  the film proves that there is much to be gained from wading into the lake of obscenity. Packed between laughs about bodily functions and social taboos  are searing insights about improvisation  character  show business  and things which most of us would not willingly put in our mouths. The movie hits on many different levels and stands as an insightful sociological achievement garbed in laughter.\tI was bored  not offended  for the first ten or fifteen minutes. Then I got the \""joke\"" and laughed so hard I had tears in my eyes as did my companion. However the couple in front of me and at least three others were so offended they walked out. BE WARNED: the language alone is so vile that people were upset enough to walk out so gird yourself for unimaginable filth before purchasing a ticket. I saw this movie at Sundance and therefore the audience was more likely to enjoy a film like this yet still several walked out. I fear in wide release it will have many more who walk out in disgust and there will be politicians and pundits bellyaching on the Fox Propaganda Channel. And get ready to see Bob Saget in a whole new light. He is in the film being particularly disgusting and the director was asked what was up with Bob. Mr. Provenza answered by saying Bob is one of the dirtiest comics in the business and related a story about his making a joke about his preemie daughter that is too disgusting to be repeated here. Naturally the audience again roared with laughter.\tHere's the premise of the movie......It is an old vaudeville joke about a family looking to get into show business. They go into an agents office looking for representation  the agents asks \""what's your act?\""- The comedy then ensues. Each comic in this film attempts to answer the agents question in the most outlandish  disgusting  ludicrous and hilarious story/joke possible. They continuously one up each other. This movie is not for the faint of heart AT ALL. These comics REALLY get into it and that's the point. I strongly suggest everyone see it  I am a huge comedy fan and with so many talented comics in this movie you're bound to see or hear something/someone you absolutely love. You should see this with a group of people and compare notes afterward!\tAfter seeing \""The Aristocrats\"" I found myself wondering if I truly enjoyed a film about the craziest joke in the world. The answer: Almost.The film itself centers around a single premise: A joke with the punch line \""The Aristocrats!\"" has existed for a long time  and many different comedians tell their versions and try to explain why the joke is funny  allowing reflection on what makes this particular joke so memorable and humorous.Don't get me wrong. There are parts of this movie where I was having difficulty breathing due to the humor and the telling of \""the joke.\"" Some of the deliveries were flawless  executed with the aggressiveness and impartial judgment that have made some comedians famous.But some comedians I didn't find funny. And their telling of \""the joke\"" created another feeling inside me: How much longer is he going to try to make me laugh? And the problem here is that these parts of the movie are just very difficult to sit through. Using foul language and references to numerous taboos is one thing  but it hurts to listen to a comedian do it badly.Ultimately  the comedians do a good job of explaining some of the finer nuances of \""the joke\""  comedy in general  and its place in our lives. But the film spends more time on each comedians' angle with \""the joke\"" than the development of why the joke is great. And I think the movie suffered from it. Listening to the philosophy of \""the joke\"" was great; listening to bad comics preach the scripture was unbearable.So the dilemma was created: I thought I enjoyed the film afterward  but I didn't know. After careful deliberation  I gave it a 7  losing 3 stars through the lack of developing more comedic philosophy and for the sometimes painfully unfunny moments a movie like this has in it.\t\""The Aristocrats\""  the hilarious documentary directed by Paul Provenza  and produced by  among others  Penn Jilette  is one of the funniest things about American stand up comedy  period! Mr. Provenza was able to amass some of the best exponents of this typical form of entertainment in which the classic joke is reinterpreted by whoever happens to be on the screen at any given moment.Granted  this film is not for everyone who might object to be a witness a gross joke being told the way it's supposed to be told. It's a credit to Mr. Provenza and everyone involved in this project not to stray from the joke itself in all its exaggerated detail.\""The Aristocrats\"" is an excellent documentary that will be appreciated by all fans of comedy. The film is laugh riot because it comes out naturally with what appears to be an improvisational style. The joke being told for our benefit by some of the best talent performing today in this country.\tThere was definitely too much hype  but the movie is still worth seeing if you don't object to obscene humor in principle. I found it amusing rather than sidesplitting funny. However there are several moments that make the show well worth it. My favorite \""straight\"" telling of the joke is by Taylor Negron  whom I don't otherwise know and have not seen mentioned among the top comedians performing here. Other than that  the places where I laughed were not so much when the \""joke\"" was being told  much less explained and commented upon  but when the comedian would add something unexpected.Needless to say  don't go see this if you dislike crude humor.\tI caught a sneak preview of this flick from the front row of a packed theater. Nonetheless  a good time was had. What intrigued me about this movie was twofold. 1) It was free. 2) One of my female colleagues first told me about it and read aloud many of the dirty words and phrases  often times naming body parts and acts that I found incredibly exciting. I would have expected a movie with such a narrow focus to drag  but it didn't. I was also expecting some sort of free-speech slant to things  which would have been incredibly boring. But they didn't do this either. It was just pure entertainment. My only word of caution: See this movie at an off-peak time. There will be a lot of braying from the audience (and applause  God help us)  which can drown out some of the dialog. The jokes come in rapid succession  so a boisterous crowd will certainly tax the ear if not ruin jokes entirely. Enjoy!\tOK  I walked out of this movie feeling dirty. Most porn films have more taste than this film...it is just the lewdest movie I have ever seen or heard. That said  I remember several instances in which I was laughing hysterically  even as I questioned myself for laughing. This film is so off-color and so crude that it has to be laughed at. It essentially has 100 comedians (and 1 mime) telling (and/or commenting on) the same joke. It seems that this joke  and I won't tell it here  differs greatly depending on who is telling it  and the more foul and profane it becomes  the funnier it is.As such  if you are remotely prudish  shy  wary of foul language  or if you prefer entertainment that is politically or socially correct  stay away from this film. If  like me  you can suspend your better sensibilities for an hour and a half in order to simultaneously laugh and grimace  try it out."""
The Aviator (2004),"****Excellent ***Good **Fair *Poor Before watching \The Aviator\"" I knew nothing about Howard Hughes. I had heard about him a couple of times  but basically knew nothing about this man. So  in a way this film was very educational. I think director Martin Scorsese did an amazing job of showcasing Howard Hughes life as a Hollywood filmmaker and Aviation pioneer. Every once in a while during the viewing of this film I felt as if I hadn't really accomplished anything in life. Hughes lived such a fascinating life compared to that of an average Joe. It is really kind of sad that his phobias got the best of him and he spend the final two decades of his life in isolation. Who knows what he could have accomplished.As for the performances  they were all amazing. I have never really been a fan of Leo  but I was really impressed with his performance. It was amazing. And the technical team was as impressive. The production design  costumes  cinematography  editing  etc  were all at top level. And I especially loved how Scorsese played around with the color filter to resemble the colorized pictures of the time.RATING: 4 STARS (****)\tI know all of the other people who liked this will tell me to f*** off  but I'll live with that burden. The only thing truly amazing was the camera work and some of the acting  Robert Richardson you are a genius. The colors were so very contrasted. anyway  it sucked. the acting wasn't that good. if I had to choose between seeing that and seeing Ray again  I would choose Ray  a million times over. The special effects were terrible. The soundtrack was too. I can't believe the way they ended it. it was the worst ending since the first cut of clerks by Kevin Smith (which re-cut is one of the best movies ever). Just because I'm a Kevin Smith Fan and I don't like the aviator doesn't mean I don't like drama. my favorite movies are dramas. Jay and Silent Bob strike back was even better than this!\tI found it extremely difficult to sit through this \""Hollywood Blockbuster\"". THere just wasn't anything there to keep me entertained.Leo's portrayal of Howard Hues the germophobic  womanizing  obsessive compulsive  maniac  was just as any of his movies... Long  boring  overly dramatic  and played up with a really funny voice. During one part of the movie  an airplane he is flying takes a horrible crash in the middle of a large populated area. I've never felt happier to see a character dying in a film. And yet... he lives! Kate Beckinsale  a woman whom I admire in Hollywood  had the most annoying and pointless part in the film. She seems to be the \""fallback\"" girl for Hues  who he wants to marry  just because  brings him down into nothingness  and then drags him back up because she feels sorry for him. She sort of has a \""woman of the evening\"" feeling about her.You are also not spared in this movie  pointless nudity  which is to say that we see quite a bit of a naked Leo  who is afraid of the germs on his clothes 3/4 of the way into the film. It was pointless! All in all  it was difficult to stay in the room while this movie was playing. It's ending didn't play out  and I just have the feeling that I wasted 2 and a half hours of my life.\tCuriously anaemic biopic that works hard to deliver little. There's definite promise in the early scenes where the young Hughes comes across as a sleazeball with the nightclub waitress and you wonder how this particular shade of character will be reconciled with all the other shades still to be painted in. But then. . . there aren't any more. The script abandons any notion of complexity and instead drops into neutral  leaving all concerned to do their best with an acting vehicle that never once gets off the ground.Scorsese is too canny a director not to know when things aren't working out  but there's real desperation here in the extended aircraft crash sequence  as blatant a case as ever there was of special effects being rushed in to enliven a movie that's lost its way as well as its pace.Shame. It could  and should  have been so much  much better.\tI would not have seen this film if my wife had not bought it on the sly. My prejudice is based on a personal bias against the Star  the person (Hughes) represented  the State where our man was born  and the Director. Armed with this sort of informed doubt  I am seldom burdened with a dud movie. We have a large collection of DVD releases  a small house  and limited storage space. Any addition to the collection has to be good enough to bump some earlier selection out to the Thrift Store shelves. In other words  to earn a place on our shelf  a film has to be a convincing WINNER and BETTER than something else already there. So  it was with misgivings that I agreed to sit through \""The Aviator\"". So  I did. My wife loved it (or  the Kate Hepburn part). I hated it  all of it.It would have been sufficient for the director to simply state that \""HH\"" inherited much more money than he deserved and got on with the business of playing with it. And  with anything else that came his way. The ending could have come next but that was somewhere in the muddle (er  middle) just before \""HH\"" leaped out of bed and raced to the Government Hearings to protect his good name. Our man was really upset when he divined somehow that he was not believed and that made him a liar! (\""...I am not  nor I have been  A LIAR!...\"") Hmm  reminds me of Nixon telling us he was not a crook. Onward.(In fairness  \""HH\"" was quoted as saying that other companies had signed contracts to deliver defensive weapons that became obsolete with the end of World War II. Furthermore  those companies had not delivered unwanted weapons. How short sighted he was - we still see some of those aircraft flying around to this day. We could use some more of them  too. Forest fires  don't you know?) Well  \""HH\"" hocked the farm to get TWA (Teeny Weenie Airlines?) off the ground. This was interesting. It seems that there really was a bad guy after all. The U.S. Government. NO! That was Juan Trippe  president of Pan American Airways. All that fellow wanted was a monopoly of passenger business everywhere. Sheese! Another Henry Ford/John Rockefeller. \""HH\"" resented that fellow.I grew up about 3 miles from the Hughes Aircraft factory over near Loyola College; I heard about the \""Spruce Goose\"" but never had a glimpse of it - did not see it moved by truck - did not see it taxi and do wind sprints out in the Harbor - Saw the huge hangar where it sat for decades. I never even got into the geodesic tomb built for it in later years. - Just heard a lot about it. I do remember that \""HH\"" and a crew of dozens (3 to 5 per engine) drove it out into the Harbor and ran it back and forth and that he actually lifted it out of the water for a short run. Local press derided him for not getting it up further - we were all disappointed. Not in the movie  however. There he gooooooooeeeeesssssss!!!!!! Yay! I finally caught up with it in McMinnville  Oregon in 1995. It was sitting in a parking lot  not assembled yet. Phooey. (\""HH\"" also built a huge helicopter for some reason.) Where were we? Oh yes  \""The Aviator\"". The special scenes showing the crash of the TurboProp showed the right wing slicing through the wall of a house that must have been a thousand feet long and all built from rice paper. Yes  \""HH\"" was lucky. And obnoxious. The film did nothing to correct our impressions of him. As it turned out  \""HH\"" was just another shark in the Hollywood Pool. At least his aircraft were interesting.\tOkay  I'm still recovering from \""The Titanic\"" debacle  so I didn't buy into Leonardo Di Caprio playing Howard Hughes  and although Kate Blanchett's portrayal of Kathryn Hepburn was shrill and annoying  and the pseudo-psychology used to explain Mr. Hughes's idiosyncrasies were flat-out crude and ludicrous  and the scene where Mr. Hughes is staggering around in his hotel room naked utterly devoid of any entertainment value  still this is a solid movie. It's a solid movie because of the life of Howard Hughes itself. The story of Howard Hughes is not his mental illness  nor his affair with Kathryn Hepburn  nor his run-in with Congress. Rather the story of Howard Hughes is about what Hughes did  what he built  what he accomplished  what an incredibly great and gifted man he was. He was rich man  but he was also a worker  a test pilot  a builder  an innovator  an inventor  as well as a pioneer Hollywood producer and director. No matter how hard this movie tries to portray Mr. Hughes as some kind of oddball  and no matter how unbelievable and superficial is Mr. Di Caprio's portrayal of Howard Hughes  the man's accomplishments could not be ignored or denigrated  even in this movie  and they speak for themselves. So Howard Hughes had mental problems? So what? What is important is what Howard Hughes did  and for that reason this movie should be watched.\tMaybe Scorsese should have gone for a biopic of Jean Harlow  as this has all her shallow glitter  glamour and artifice but lacks any emotional depth or substance. Might also have persuaded him to hire someone more convincing than Gwen Stefani for the role too  but I digress. Plus points: looks great  though often in a curiously indulgent way (blowing the effects budget on Hughes near-fatal crash for example). Some fine performances  notably Cate Blanchett doing a star turn as Katherine Hepburn  the only impersonation which really convinces (Kate Beckinsale manages to look like neither Ava Gardner nor Kate Beckinsale). Leonardo DiCaprio acts his socks off but to no avail - it's that chubby kid again  pretending to be Howard Hughes this time. Disbelief never suspended  but it's a casting fault  not his. Big negatives: it's so damn boring. It seems to go on for ever. It's very old fashioned  being more concerned with chronology and events than really putting work into the connecting themes. Had Scorsese had concentrated on one relationship - maybe the Hughes/ Hepburn thing  which had some really fine  delicate moments - and built a smaller film around that - maybe with a grown-up playing Hughes - it could have been way better  but I guess he's not that kind of director. I kept thinking of that Jonathan Demme movie  'Howard and Melvin'  where Jason Robards' Hughes is only on screen for a few moments yet resonates through the film (and continues to do so afterwards) in a way that diCaprio never does here. To quote Aimee Mann  and like Hughes own colossally expensive yet largely forgotten 'Hell's Angels'  what a waste of gunpowder and sky....\tNobody can deny that Howard Hughes had a tremendous impact  not just on America but over the whole world and to film a biopic of him could never be boring. Another matter is to watch it and I must say that even though the movie does have stunning sequences and you can tell that everything in the flying sequences was well researched  it does leave you rather unfulfilled at the end. The trouble begins  as it usually does with the performances of the actors. Leonardo DiCaprio does well in the opening sequences and in one particular scene (the premiere of Hell's Angels) he captures just about every aspect of his character which unfortunately will be overemphasized through the rest of the movie. Like another of Scorsese's favorites  De Niro  he is pretty much let loose to bring out every emotion that he has in order to make the character a human being  rather than a stereotype.The supporting cast are not so lucky and I must say that even though Cate Blanchett is very good indeed as Katherine Hepburn  she hardly deserved the Oscar for her performance here. Her one great moment is when she and Dicaprio visits her family and they play a game of one-up-man-ship but that is more a collaborative effort.Another supporting actor nominee  Alan Alda  is serviceable as the slimy senator on the take from Alec Baldwin. His scene with Dicaprio at the hotel lunch meeting is some of the best acting he has ever done  despite the fact that it is rather superfluous because it is merely a set up for the big Senate hearing. The third actor worth mentioning is John C. Reilly who is in nearly every major American film today. Here he gets to play a normal character for once but he is terribly wasted. We don't feel that he is all that important neither to Hughes or the film.So to repeat what I said earlier: The story of Hughes is fascinating but like so many biopics it is not completely up to par with the real story. I think the opening caption on this film says it all: \""Based on a true story\"" and not \""The full story\"".\tI'll be short.The plane's flying are photographed more beautifully than any other film ever. It shows a thrill just as Top Gun.The music while flying happens to be my favorite classical pieces. Fuga in d of Bach and the Requiem of Mozart  but played like I've never heard it.This is a story that had to be told. I knew the man (Huges) from NGC documentaries  but he deserved a movie.The drama is strong. It 's been a while since I saw such a tormented soul as Huges.Wonderful directing  very good acting.\tWhat in the world happened to Martin Scorsese? Here is the creator of Dog Day Afternoon and Wise Guys  a man considered one of the best of the 1970's Golden Age of Film  but film by film his stuff gets more over produced  less insightful  and more expensive. I saw it coming with Gangs of New York  but somebody keep Leonardo DiCaprio away from this guy. They are awful together and The Aviator is one big expensive  good-looking bore without a soul.In a documentary on Neo-Realism  Italian Post War Cinema  Scorsese claims he started with storyboards as a child  a comic book look that is produced giving the director a visualization of what the film will look like. The trouble with The Aviator  it looks like a storyboard. The replicas and animation of Hugh's weird airplanes almost steal the show  because they are the only interesting thing to look at on screen. Howard Hughes is never fleshed out. At least Kinsey  a recent bio flick tried to show why Kinsey was what he was  but DiCaprio's Hugh's is some kind of freak because his mother talked about diseases while he bathed. There's not enough there Martin. The bulk of the film shows a very young actor with no physical resemblance to Howard Hughes talking big time business and avionics without any back-story on how he became so brilliant out of the crib? The women in Hugh's life are trotted out one by one. He's a cocky guy putting his hand under a cigarette flappers skirt  a rich boy lover for Kathryn Hepburn (She doesn't come off too swell in this version)  and Ava Gardner (No wonder Sinatra and Artie Shaw had it easy with this chick after the money-bags geekdom of Hughes). None of these gals are fleshed out other than Hollywood publicity shrek.Don't bother with this one.\tI really enjoyed this movie. I am not a big fan of DiCaprio  but I have to say hats of to the guy  this was an excellent performance.There seems to be a lot of talk about the character of Hughes as not being likable  and perhaps this is not the best way to make people like the film. I have to disagree  this is a commentary on a major figure in aviation history. What would be the point in making a film about him and changing him so that he was more likable? By all accounts he was a man driven incessantly by a desire to succeed  to go one step further in aviation. DiCaprio captured this about the man completely. Of course as most truly driven people are  he made enemies and some people simply found him too much. He would have not been an easy man to be around  even when his psychological problems were not affecting him. If the character had been softened to make him easier to like  then it would not have been a film about Howard Hughes.Nevertheless as the film progresses there is clearly a sense of loyalty toward the man from the growing population of people who work for him  he is clearly looked up to and there is the desire of his closest colleagues and friends to keep his problems out of the headlines  to protect him from pressure and harm. Even though he may not have been the easiest man to like  it is clear that he was liked by a great many people.Cate Blanchett was just perfect as Kathryn Hepburn as was Kate Bekinsale as Ava Gardener  and the insight into 1920-40 Hollywood was interesting.In my opinion  Alec Baldwin had the weakest character although I would not go so far as to say he did a bad job of portraying the bad guy of Pan American. Alan Alda (as always) provided a much better \""bad guy\"" though in the form of the Senator whose \""witch hunt\"" enquiry was torn apart by a determined Hughes.I quite enjoy long films  but this is longer than most. There are not many films this long that I would want to watch many times  but I think I will be watching this again soon as I was engrossed in the story from beginning to end. It's a shame that film is only concerned with Hughes life up till the maiden (and only) flight of the Hurcules  but if his whole life had been handled then in my opinion it would have seemed a very rushed and crowded film.Recommended.\tWhat's the problem with this movie?? Great expectations i had  and in the beginning i was really into the movie. And then... when the triumph started. When you get to see the real Hughes and his drama. The movie ends?! In the middle of Hughes life. Why? Where is the drama of seeing what's become of a great man  with great idea's. And getting at the end  alone in the world and afraid of everything!! But nothing about that in the movie. You see just the beginning of this all. I was completely surprised and disappointed the moment the credits began to roll. Even angry at some time. For the next time Scorsese  when you're telling us a story  finish it!!! And try to get to a point. The looks of the movie are very good  really authentic  but the certain stop makes this movie going down the drain..\tHaving missed The Aviator in the theaters  I purchased a used DVD from my local video chain for a bargain $9.99 and watched it over three days while exercising on the treadmill.I found this movie very  very entertaining  and it made the minutes on my treadmill seem like seconds. but... Leonardo DeCaprio never convinced me that he was Howard Hughes. In other films  the performances were so good that the actor became the character (Malcom X and Ray come to mind). But my only real gripe about this movie is the ending.It almost felt as if the director was leaving the door open for an Aviator  Part II. We never know what became of the Senate Hearings and we never know what became of the potential purchase of TWA. Despite this  I found it an excellent depiction of a fascinating era in American History. I saw Million Dollar Baby and  in my opinion  this is a FAR superior picture  though no better than an 8.\tCan't see why there's been such a fuss about this movie. Considering Scorsese directed such masterpieces as Taxi Driver  it is a real disappointment. I mean  you just have to have a look at the Wikipedia article to see what an exceptional character Hughes was  and Di Caprio certainly wasn't the guy to play the part. His acting is not particularly bad  it is just awfully boringly obvious. No depth  no complexity  no ambiguity. He looks angry when he has to be angry  sound megalomaniac when he has to be megalomaniac... nothing more. Besides  Hughes was certainly a ladies'man  but one can't say that the affairs with Kate Hepburn or Ava Gardner are really interesting (and  most of all  DiCaprio never seems really interested in any of them).Admittedly  a biopic is a difficult exercise  and few of them are what you may call masterpieces. Certainly  this one won't change my opinion of the genre.\tScorsese's film is better after watching it for a second time. I love this film. Its absolutely perfect. A 170 minute film that kept me interested throughout the whole thing. Its a great biopic about Howard Hughes and the obstacles he encountered while making great advancements in aviation and making a few films as well. Scorsese's direction is brilliant  i love the mood and feel of this film. Great job again by my favorite director. The screenplay is very interesting  at times very funny and great drama  John Logan (of Last Samurai  Gladiator fame) does a good job here. The cast is also good  Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances  he is better than Gangs of New York which i previously believed to be his best performance along with What's eating gilbert grape. Cate Blanchett shines as the leading lady  great to see her working with scorsese. The supporting cast is great as well  kate beckinsale was believable and good as ava gardner a few steps up from her poor acting in pearl harbor. Adam Scott was also good in this film. John C. Reily  Alan Alda and Ian Holm all gave great supporting performances as well. The film has a great score by Howard Shore  and great cinematography by a very talented Robert Richardson (Bringing out the dead  u-turn  casino)  this guy has filmed some of my favorite films  great cinematography in aviator as well. There was nothing i didn't like about this film  I mean i usually am critical of Scorsese  but i don't see why people bash his later efforts  his past 3 films are all personal favorites of mine and although they don't rank as high as Taxi Driver  Casino  and Goodfellas in my favorite film list  they are still up there. Anyhow  10/10 for Aviator  #45 on my list of all time favorite films\tOver 2000 years ago Aristotle observed that a selection of true incidents from someone's life doesn't necessarily add up to an effective story. THE AVIATOR proves Aristotle's point.Here's a movie that takes a lot of really interesting people and makes them -- not very interesting. The weakness is mainly the superficial script  which covers Hughes the aviation pioneer (much of this is quite exciting)  Hughes the Hollywood producer (this is sketchy and disjointed)  Hughes the womanizer (sketchy and uninvolving)  and Hughes the obsessive-compulsive eccentric -- but never quite succeeds in pulling all these elements into a persuasive whole.At the end of this very  very long film  I didn't really *feel* anything about Hughes  either positive or negative. He seems as cold and remote at the end as at the beginning and the last hour drags.What Scorcese needed was a screenplay that would make us care about Hughes -- either love him or hate him -- the way CITIZEN KANE does. But THE AVIATOR is no KANE. It tries to cover too much  and you never really know why some things were included and others omitted; the result is the incidents covered seem shallow  obvious  and quickly glossed-over.Still  there are a number of excellent scenes in the film. My favorite is Hughes' visit to Katherine Hepburn's family  where her relations -- as headstrong and self-involved as she is -- treat him with hilarious rudeness.I should confess I have a problem with DiCaprio: I have trouble accepting him as a grown-up. He always seems to me like a 14 year-old boy playing an adult in a junior High School play. He's a pretty good actor; he applies himself and he's quite talented. I don't know why that boyish thing bothers me  just as it did in TITANIC  where Kate Winslett seemed more like his aunt than his lover.Even Scorcese's period mise en scene fails to persuade. The sets and costumes are all so colorful  so squeaky-clean  they seem made for a musical comedy rather than a serious period drama. And Scorcese makes too many obvious choices  such as the movie Hughes watches that convinces him the public now wants sound films. Of course it's THE JAZZ SINGER.As in NEW YORK  NEW YORK  there's a ton of painstaking period detail  but it doesn't ring true. You don't feel you're really in the 1930s and 40s  any more than you believe Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow. Cate Blanchett tries a little too hard as Katherine Hepburn  though it's basically an intelligent and effective performance. Her strenuous efforts to imitate Hepburn's well-known vocal mannerisms are distracting at times.So I can see why THE AVIATOR lit no fires either at the box office or at the Oscars. A huge amount of work and money went into a film that is frequently interesting  but finally not all that compelling.\t\""The Aviator\"" focuses on the brilliant and tragic life of the fascinating madman and genius  Howard Hughes  1905-1976  (to be precise  20 years of it  from 1927 when 22 years old Hughes was producing the film \""Hell's Angels\"" until 1947 when his most famous aircraft  the Hercules was completed). The film is as amazing and dark as the man who called himself with pride  \""Howard Hughes  the Aviator\"". Cinematography  Art Direction  and Editing were perfect in the almost 3 hours long film that never for a moment seemed too long or boring. Martin Scorsese made a spectacular and dynamic picture and Leonardo DiCaprio earns my respect and admiration for his acting - he is one of the most talented young actors now and I will be waiting for his following films impatiently. I trusted him in every scene and he made me feel strongly for and sympathize with Howard Hughes's affliction.Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin both gave great performances as the corrupted and disgusting Senator Brewster (Alda) and truly memorable Pan-American Airways CEO Juan Trippe  Hughes' enemy and competitor (Baldwin played a delightful villain). Surprisingly for myself  I didn't like very much Cate Blanchett's impersonation of Katherine Hepburn (I usually love Blanchette in every movie I've seen her) \u0096 it seemed more like caricature but it is a matter of personal liking or not.I feel that \""The Aviator\"" took off the ground like a huge steel bird and took me with it to the marvelous journey. I also believe that \""The Aviator\"" is much better and more interesting film than the last year's Oscar winner - but again  this is my opinion. You  of course are entitled to have yours which may be completely different from mine.\tAfter seeing the ratings and reading some comments on this movie  I find that I must be out of touch (be nice  now). I just couldn't get into this lightweight treatment of the subject...Howard Hughes.I know that some think DeCaprio is a great actor...Please! He was totally unconvincing  that is if you are old enough to remember the real Hughes.And Blanchett did an atrocious Hepburn. I at least expect to be drawn into the character  both by physical looks and actions. If you remember Hepburn in her early days  you know she was a striking beauty  not a broad-nosed  wide-faced plain looking gal. Her voice characterizations seemed strained to me.I was never drawn into this movie  although it had some good special effects  not counting the obvious computer generations. IMO  Scorcese needs to get a new casting director or consider hanging up his track shoes. I have come to expect far better movies from him than this piece of polyester.\tOkay  I admit it. I watched all 170 minutes of The Aviator  although it took me two nights to do it. I liked the film enough to keep watching  but not enough to give it a rave review. Leonardo does an excellent job of portraying this larger-than-legendary man  even if he looks a bit too young for too much of the film. Cate Blanchett was  as so many have said  exquisite as the inimitable Katherine Hepburn. At several points  I got lost in the time-line of Howard Hughes' life. For example  I couldn't tell if his relationship with Hepburn lasted months or years. In the scene where he goes wacko in his screening room  I didn't know if that was days  weeks  or months  or whether he's still holed up there today. (Of course I have since learned that he is dead  but I guess that part will be covered in the sequel.) While it was useful to see how his character deteriorates into a state of verbal tics and OCD hell  I found it somewhat unbelievable that he could testify at a Congressional hearing with such clarity only days (if I got that time-line straight) after an apparent psychiatric episode. The costumes and special effects are superb  but as for the plot  I felt something was missing. Who was that milked man?\tIt ain't always easy being a visionary and an innovative genius - just ask Howard Hughes  the renowned millionaire  who had three main ambitions in life: to build the fastest airplanes  to make the biggest movies  and to become the richest man in the world. That he achieved those lofty goals at a very great personal cost to himself is what makes his story the stuff of legend. For Hughes also suffered from the demon of mental illness  which manifested itself in chronic obsessive/compulsive behavior  a neurotic fear of germs  and acute paranoia. Martin Scorsese captures all facets of this larger-than-life figure in \""The Aviator \"" a high-flying epic that does justice to a man who became a national icon and the embodiment of the American dream despite his internal weaknesses - and whose legend lives on today.John Logan's script spends virtually no time on Hughes' youth except for a brief prologue which shows Howard's hypochondriac mother planting those seeds of fear in his tender psyche that would haunt him the rest of his life. The story proper begins with Hughes' efforts to produce what would turn out to be the most expensive film ever made up to that time  the war epic \""Hell's Angels \"" a non-studio work that allowed Hughes to combine his twin loves of movie-making and aviation. If nothing else  Hughes thought BIG  and his capriciousness and profligacy  as reflected in the mounting budget of the film he was making  also spilled over into the realm of aviation  as he began looking for ways to create ever more aerodynamic airplanes at greater and greater cost. His obsession with size culminated in the creation of the ill-fated Spruce Goose  the largest airplane ever made - and one whose airborne career lasted exactly one flight.Logan and Scorcese also focus on the personal side of Hughes' life  concentrating specifically on his tumultuous affairs with Katharine Hepburn (brilliantly played by Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). His relationship with Hepburn is a particularly telling one because they seem to understand one another so well - so well  in fact  that they are unable to make a permanent go of things and wind up going their separate ways.As director  Scorcese brings his usual flair and visual inventiveness to the film  soaring highest - as is appropriate  perhaps - in the aviation sequences. The first hour  in particular  moves at a breathless clip  as he weaves the various strands of his epic - yet  at the same time  intimate - story into a cohesive whole. If the truth be told  at 170 minutes  the movies does run a little too long and it sags a bit in its middle section. However  as Hughes begins to unravel psychologically - at one point locking himself in a screening room barely clingi"
The Brothers Grimm (2005),"Not quite the story of the Brothers Grimm I know  but Terry Giliam and his awesome crew did an amazing job of telling a fairy tale. Matt Damon and Heat Ledger do the job as the Brothers. You'll find yourself listing the fairy stories as they either are told or happen. Glorious. Set in the Germany of Napoleonic France  the Brothers are set a task by the Delatombe (Jonathon Pryce)  the Brothers find themselves inside an enchanted town beset by a supernatural evil that they must overcome despite interference by their French watcher and the French Army. Sleeping Beauty with a twist. In true Gilliam style  there are some quick  blink and you miss them sight gags. Shot in Prague  Czech Republic  the film is dark  yet beautiful.\tWow! When I was counting down the days The Brothers Grimm would come out I knew it was going to be great! But once I saw it WOW! It was AMAZING! I am totally in love with this movie  the casting could not have been better. Even though Nicole Kidman was supposed to be the evil queen  and they had to replace her  I have to say I love the actress they put in instead of her. Don't get me wrong  i'm a fan of Nicole but I cannot see her as the queen! I definitely think she suited the part. If anyone know's the actress' name please post it and let me know. Also How much did you love the chemistry between Heath Ledger and Matt Damon! First of all I've been a fan of Heath since 10 Things I Hate About You  and Matt Damon since Oceans 11! I love them both So much! They are such talented actors... plus they're super hot :D:D:D:D:D ha ha okay well now that i've gushed enough please post here commenting on how much you loved this movie :D Cheers! Lot's of Love from Canada  Saira\tThe titled characters (Matt Damon and Heath Ledger) are early-19th century ghost-busters/con artists in French-occupied Germany who get immersed in a wicked scheme by a long-gone queen (Monica Belluci) who is trying to live again by taking the bodies and souls of youthful girls and women. Typical unfunny comedy routines by director Terry Gilliam and an uninspired script that is a melting pot of fairy tales  mythology  history and everything in between kills any hope that \The Brothers Grimm\"" had to be much of a movie. The film is dark  hard to look at and suffers from an identity crisis on top of yet another identity crisis. Damon and Ledger  usually reputable performers  get sucked into a whirlwind of dumb ideas and down-right poor film-making methods. A total disappointment that goes up about like a lead balloon. 2 stars out of 5.\tMany people  viewers and critics alike  are panning this movie. As a Gilliam fan  I wanted to see it for myself. As it happens  I liked it a great deal. I think that part of the issue for those who don't like it is that this is not an example of linear storytelling. In fact  later in the film  realism is totally eliminated - the story moves into the realm of the symbolic.I think that reading \""The Uses of Enchantment\"" by Bruno Bettelheim would enhance the enjoyment of this movie for many people. Gilliam's use of the symbolism from many of our most famous archetypal fairy tales had my head spinning (that's in a positive way!)OK  maybe it sounds like a real drag for someone to suggest that you read a book before you see this movie. Actually  I'm not suggesting that - most people wouldn't be interested in doing that  anyway. It's a shame  though  because ultimately I don't think there is a large audience for this movie. I feel that it will achieve \""cult status\"" (as so many of Gilliam's movies have before).It really does help to have the background in the archetypal aspects of \""Hansel and Gretel\""  \""Little Red Riding Hood\""  \""Rapunzel\""  \""Sleeping Beauty\""  \""Snow White\"" and others that the Bettelheim book provides  though - with that knowledge  this film can be seen as a really exceptional piece of entertainment.\tI was very disappointed. I don't like to criticize films. I go to have a good time  but this one was just real bad. Save your money. Stay home and watch The Closer (TNT) or BattleStar Galactica (Sci-Fi)  both are much better and free. Thank God for HBO.Matt Damon didn't need that much makeup. He looked like an overgrown Oompa-Loompas from the original Willy Wonka film. That's what I should have seen. You can always count on at least a little genius from Burton.If I knew this had to be ten lines  I'd never have started writing this damn review. Enjoy some popcorn and a coke. Pop Secret is better than anything you can get at the theatre anyway.I've rediscovered the Coke float  well the Pepsi float. If you haven't had one in a while  give it a try. Really good.\t\""The Brothers Grimm\"" is a delightful reminder of the power of folk tales for humor  shock and awe. Terry Gilliam accents the Python-esquire political jokes with eye-dazzling visuals that are both funny and scary.The film opens (and closes) with what feels like a loving tribute to the Bob Hope/Bing Crosby \""On the Road\"" movies of a cheerful pair of regular guy con men traveling through colorful geographies  and there's more than one reference to \""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\"" as these are thinkers not superheroes. While it takes a while for Matt Damon and Heath Ledger to develop on screen chemistry (I wonder if Damon's credited entourage had anything to do with that)  Damon's wandering British accent fits in with the good-natured joshing.While the Yankee won with science  the philosophical debate here is Napoleon's foppish army  with its buffoonish Italian ally  trying to impose rational Enlightenment on a \""French Occupied Germany\"" bound by superstitions  wryly hinting at their cultural affinity for ideological myths. Jacob and William Grimm are charged  under penalty of gruesome death of course  to prove that strange phenomenon have rational explanations. But Ledger's \""Jake\"" actually believes in \""the magic beans\"" and the film warmly supports the power of such notions (either that or  says \""Will\""  \""They have a lot more funding than we do.\"")  much as does \""The Princess Bride.\""The combination is reminiscent of \""Ghostbusters\"" and Tim Burton's \""Sleepy Hollow \"" but quite a bit more frightening than Disney's \""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\"" (or any Disneyfication of folk tales)-- from girls in coffins  to lots of bugs  to horrific spells  to severed torsos  to medieval torture a la \""Young Frankenstein \"" which reinforces the original role of these stories  according to Bruno Bettelheim. We see bits and pieces for the inspirations for the Grimm Brothers and other compilers with scary elements of \""Little Red Riding Hood \"" (that's the most explicit child swallowing I've seen in awhile)  \""Sleeping Beauty \"" \""Jack and the Beanstalk \"" \""The Gingerbread Man \"" \""The Pied Piper of Hamelin \"" \""Rapunzel \"" \""Cinderella \"" etc. (The toddler next to me at a matin\u00e9e fell asleep after the first half hour so I'm not sure how small kids would react.)Most of the audience is far too busy keeping up with the ever morphing images to take note of the constant stream of verbal puns and euro jokes about frogs  other than Jonathan Pryce's and Peter Stormare's over the top foils and such broad visual ones with wigs  compared with Mackenzie Crook who is an amusing sidekick.The special effects are wonderful  with even a better moving forest than \""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.\"" The film is a bit slow to get to the finale  with the additional gypsy-flavored denouement  but it does all hang together at the climax.The women are notably not bland  from Lena Headey's feisty \""Angelika \"" Monica Bellucci's Evil Queen who may just be the fairest one of all  spirited young girls and a recurring old crone. It looks like every resident of Prague must have been involved in the production and is thanked in the closing credits.\tI guess it's no shock that a film titled THE BROTHERS GRIMM has nothing at all to do with the actual Brothers Grimm. After all  who wants to see a film about writers? Where's the action and adventure in that  eh? Instead  Director Terry Gilliam and cohorts contrive to make the famous fairy story scribes into something resembling 19th century Ghostbusters. Accepting this shoddy premise  the film begins with a promising flashback (something about beans) and then resolutely shies away from character development for the ensuing two hours. The writers have forged a plot that would boggle the mind of the most intrepid film-goer. Even the anticipated humor (expected due to Gilliam's comic lineage) falls flat. Despite nearly constant action  the film goes nowhere fast and never hits it's stride.Heath Ledger and Matt Damon struggle in vain to bring their flatly written fraternal figures to life but they aren't up to so great a task. Experienced Brit thesp Jonathan Pryce wields an obnoxious French accent like a weapon and Peter Stormare is just as unforgivably idiotic with his Italian dialect: a Brit and a Swede doing French and Italian accents in a Czech film about German brothers starring an American and an Australian. Do you wonder this film is a muddle? Gilliam - as usual - is much more at home with atmosphere than storyline and the film is often fascinating to look at. But it is overly long and the sightseeing trip through the enchanted forests of Bavaria gets old fast. Now if someone would just make a film about clever writers... that might be worth investing 120 minutes in. Who ya gonna call?\tI just saw this movie this morning and it was wonderful. Not exactly what I was expecting  but better as it turns out. It was a bit morbid and frightening in places  not something I would suggest bringing the small children to. The special effects were very well done. I thought they did a good job casting the movie also. The make-up artist should get an award  it can't be easy making both Damon and Ledger look that unattractive. It was very nice to see something that wasn't a remake of a television show from my childhood  this was a very ingenious movie. I strongly recommend this movie  I liked it enough I would pay to see it again.\tSome directors work best with their own material. They can use another persons' source material  like a classic novel or a newspaper article. But at the end of the process a film must bear the mark of the director. He must have many different credits. This is why many of the directors that most consider visionary best works come when they write  produce  and direct. This is the undeniable flaw of Terry Gilliam's latest film THE BROTHERS GRIM  it's got all the trademarks of Gilliam's brilliant attention to detail  it's whimsical  and full of life and color  and yet the screenplay is full of ideas that are not fully realized because they are so small in scope and Gilliam is too large in vision THE BROTHERS GRIM follows Wilhelm and Jacob (Matt Damon and Heath Ledger)  the very namesakes of the title  two con-artists traveling around French controlled Germany in 1812. They have the whole countryside believing that they have killed trolls and battled all matter of evil thing  and it's not until they stumble into some real evil that the story gets going. Somebody has kidnapped 11 little girls and it's up to the Brothers Grimm to discover who's behind the nefarious plot. They are aided by Angelika (Lena Headly)  a young woman who's two sisters were the first ones taken.To try to sum up the story any more would just confuse you. It's a story that is far richer in texture  Gilliam and screenwriter Ehren Kruger has bitten of a little more than they can chew. But they give it a shot and for the most part succeed. Some of the extraneous subplots involving the French Army are silly and stop the film cold. I could have also done without Peter Stormare's over the top acting  which at times was more grating than silly. I especially hated his thick French accent that render much of what he says unintelligible.GRIMM should be praised because what does work in the film works so well. I loved all the scenes in the tower. I loved every moment that the Brother's Grimm are in the forest. I love how Gilliam filled the forest with life. I loved the colors  and the drab textures and how they meshed together. I loved that the film made me laugh. It's so hard to find a film with such genuine and unforced laughs in it. I also believe the last twenty minutes of the film were breathtaking. Monica Bellucci was divine in a role that could have been played by any pretty little thing. In her hands and with Gilliam's attention to detail her final moments are as awe-inspiring as the dancing scene in THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN.As a matter of fact many will probably find many comparisons to the unfairly maligned film Gilliam made in 1989. Both films are rich in detail and try to handle too much at once  and yet both films are passionate and it's in their passion that the true beauty and wonder of our imaginations take hold. THE BROTHERS GRIM may have trouble finding a mainstream audience to embrace it. This is a film that will probably bore the masses and yet will find a cult audience that will eat it up. Like previous classics in the fantasy genre like LEGEND or Excalibur  GRIM is a film that will take DVD and cable to find its audience.I mast say the biggest disappointment is the ripped from INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM ending that felt tacked on and not needed. This film had a natural and far more interesting final shot before the film ends that I would have preferred but alas  I was not in the cutting room (but maybe I should have been).At the end of the day what doesn't work is the story which while layered takes very few risks. You can see what Gilliam is doing on the screen and how hard he's trying to overcome the weakness in the script and yet Kruger's script is far too small for Gilliam vision. I would have like to have seen what Gilliam would have done if he'd tackled the script as well. I see his personal touches on the screen. I just wanted a more personal touch on the story.All in all the BROTHERS GRIMM is satisfying. It's a good movie that will stand the test of time. There is an audience of people that will be receptive to it  even if the masses won't. It's a great concept film with a lackluster script.\tGreat  Great Movie.Based on the critical reviews of it  I had expected something quite different - like a snooze fest or something. I was greatly surprised. I guess this serves to remind us why movie critics do what they do - they couldn't get jobs doing anything else!It did come across as a bit anti-French - who are now the epitome of all things 'cultured'  anti-American and socialist - so maybe that is why the critics hated it. But it is an excellent movie. One is captivated from start to finish.I went into this as open minded as I could. True  Terry Gilliam gave us all Time Bandits and Brazil  and for those accomplishments alone when he dies he will go to movie heaven and become a legend. But this piece stands on its own as a great piece of entertainment and story telling.\tThis movie was what I expected it to be. Decent. I give it 7 out of 10 because it was a C movie. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular with this title because I knew the director's work and I saw the previews.Now  the good things about this movie are definitely the very dark humor  and Heath Ledger's acting. He really surprised me with his performance in this movie. It's been a long time since I actually felt somewhat sorry for a character in a movie. But you'll understand why. He's submissive because of a terrible mistake he'd made when he was a young child and his older brother played by Matt Damon. Matt Damon's performance was good (not great) and he did disappoint in some areas. The humor was quite good and the gore from this movie fit the stories. So that was all good.A bad aspect was probably the timing of the movie. It would have been a good Halloween movie or it would have been a good movie to show in less dark times. This year calls for \""ROFL\"" comedies  unfortunately  and the dark  gory nature of this film just isn't timely. That was my main complaint. That and a bit of a lack-luster ending in which it seemed they lost a lot of energy and just sort of shot it. Besides that  I recommend this movie. It was a decent flick  just not too timely.\tThis movie just doesn't know what it wants to be! Is it a comedy? Sort of. Is it a fantasy? Uh  sort of. Is it a dark drama? Yeah  sort of. It just doesn't know what it's trying to be  so it dabbles a little in everything  and does nothing well. It has some great talent  and good directing  and a great premise  but in the end  it lacks a script to do justice to any of the elements. The script tries too hard to include too many of the Grimm's Fairy tales into one story  rather than picking a few good elements  and leaving room for a legitimate sequel. Frankly  I would really like to see Heath Ledger and Matt Damon in another picture together with a better script. Bottom line analysis: Too many elements  not enough cohesion  mildly disappointing  and not worth the eight bucks admission. See this one in the dollar theaters.\tPersonally  I liked the movie... I mean sure if you don't know who the Brothers Grimm really were  it wouldn't make a lot of sense. But if you know who they were and what they did  it makes sense. It summed up a lot of the fairy tales and folk lores that they travelled Europe to find out. I mean it wasn't exactly like the Brothers Grimm I know  but how many stories are exactly what they are supposed to be? I thought the visual effects were very well done. I found it convincing  I mean of course it's not going to be 100% realistic since it is about fairy tales such as Rapunzel  Little Red Ridinghood  Goldilocks  Sleeping Beauty  and Snow White. Oh ya and Hansel and Gretel. I thought the acting was well done in it. And I also thought it was funny... I found myself laughing out loud at the jokes.One thing I didn't like was the wolf/father guy. That was just creepy... How did he turn into the wolf? I didn't understand that.\t***May contain spoilers **** It's been seven years since Terry Gilliam helmed a film. As a fan of the director  I was very excited to see that he had a new project. Unfortunately  having just watched the film  I wouldn't recommend it to others.You probably know the story - the Grimm Brothers go from village to village as exorcists-for-hire. Then they get discovered by the French authorities and they must dispel a real magical curse or die.The film is populated by many characters and images from fairy tales  including Little Red Riding Hood  Hansel & Gretel  Rapunzel  the evil queen from Snow White  etc. However  it's really a mess. The story isn't very engaging and neither are the actors. The best \""role\"" is played by Monica Belluci  who is the diabolical mirror queen. But sadly  she isn't in the film very much  maybe 20 minutes  if that.Peter Stormare who is usually pretty good in films - most notably the woodchipping lunatic in Fargo - is so annoying  I hoped that his character was a minor one. Alas  no.The accents are equally heinous. Jonathan Pryce's pronunciation is abysmal  and the film's overall depiction of the French is  once again  ridiculous. I guess they are the new demonized target of Hollywood these days  being depicted as cruel  careless and power mad. I'm quite frankly getting tired of it.The special effects are pretty good  particularly the flying witch during an early exorcism  and the frog licking is kind of cute  but this film never really knows what it wants to be. Is it funny? Is it fantasy? It's certainly excessive in length.My biggest gripe is that it doesn't even know what it's message is. One of the characters complains that Christianity was the cause of the destruction of the forest and  I guess  the people who populated the area with folklore - the kind that Jacob is trying to preserve. The French  too  stand as a symbolic of \""the Enlightenment.\"" After all  Jonathan Pryce's character wants to burn the woods and vanquish the myths. But in the end  he  himself  is destroyed because of a trick cross. So which is it? Triumph of folklore  the trees and myths or rational thought? I wish Ehren Kruger had figured out where he stood before he turned in his screenplay.More often than not  Heath Ledger seems attracted to stinkers. The Order is a great example of that  so I think if he's in a film  I might skip it. Matt Damon  I'll keep giving your films a chance. (I like most of what he's been in.) Mr. Gilliam. I hate to say it  but this film stunk. Back to the drawing board.\tNot for everyone  but enjoyable if you like this sort of thing. As a fantasy writer I found it funny with a tad bit of darkness. You must remember these are supposed to be about fairy tales. The characters will be rather daft and have a sort of stereotypical quality... This is what Disney was making films off of after all  of course they'll have irritating qualities that make them just plain stupid. I wish their had been more character development but it seemed like it would have been hard to fit it in anyway. The side characters I felt were fine and dandy. They were loopy and a bit on the stupid side just like in most Grimm tales. (take the snails for instance if you ever get to read the book and no this has nothing to do with the movie) I felt a little unfulfilled by some of it. I wanted more explanations for why things were the way they were. What had happened to make those certain things happen? Why hadn't this happened? Etc. etc. All in all... If you wanted a horror  this is not for you. I honestly thought it would be darker  but I enjoyed it anyway... But this also inst for you who are looking for a comedy. My opinion rests.\tI haven't been so angry about a movie since Bertolucci's \""1900\"" (where's Pauline Kael when you need her?) I wondered why I reacted so strongly to \""The Brothers Grimm\""  as opposed to dozens of other bad movies I've seen over the years. I realized it was just mean-spirited and artistically deficient on every possible level. The acting was embarrassingly bad (kudos to Monica Belluci for managing to play the exact same character in \""Matrix\""  \""Brotherhood of the Wolf\"" and now this disaster)  the accents were so terrible that most of the dialogue was impossible to understand. The editing was so jumpy  I felt sick. The cinematography and sets were just horrible. What was Terry Gilliam thinking when he shot scene after scene of the moving trees  the horses running through flocks of geese  crows and more crows? Last but not least  for those who think animal cruelty is cool or humorous on any level  ever  should be ashamed of themselves. Thank God I didn't bring kids. We all left the theater depressed; thanks  Miramax!\tIt suffered a lack of Gilliam. Gone were his wild swinging-in-close-ups  his over the top acting (which has suited his films perfectly)  his fun and excitement  and his sense of humor. In its place are examples and glimpses at such traits that make Gilliam Gilliam  but smoothed over to make it look and sound more like a normal movie  which only makes for a jarring experience  and drains the life almost completely out of it. Fans of Gilliam never fear  I feel he still has it  he just ran into a few problems with the studio. Plus a very poor script didn't help much either  as it lacked subtlety and coherence. All in all  the film was a complete mess  and its saving grace  to my surprise  ended up being Heath Ledger with a remarkable performance akin to that of Johnny Depp's work  as you can't help but be enchanted by his each and every move. Damon was perfectly fine  but the other characters suffered from Gilliam trying to use them his way  with his amusing over acting  but the studio shunning him at certain moments  giving for uneven  and cringe worthy performances. Its a real shame through and through. But  I imagine Tidelands will be Gilliam back in form  and I just hope The Brothers Grimm doesn't hurt his reputation.\tPeople who go into a movie wanting to know exactly what to expect hate this film. Sometimes it is hard to tell the heroes from the villains  and you have to pay attention to understand what is going on. On the other hand  its got a lot of 10 votes  from people who don't mind the kind of mumbled dialog that got Robert Altman fired from his first job and who do like to see things in movies that they've never seen before. Not as good as Time Bandits or Brazil  it is a whole lot better than Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. So  stay away from it or go depending on whether you prefer the predictable or the unusual  the slick or the slightly lumpy but with chocolate chips. Rick Norwood  sfsite\tThe worst problem with Terry Gilliam films is that they're too intellectual. For the audience that's not paying attention  the joke  as well as many of the references  go sailing overhead.With this one  the audience needs to be at least moderately well versed in the tales of the Brothers Grimm. Do parents read this stuff to their kids these days? Have they done so for the last ten years? It may only be those lucky children who have seen Steven Sondheim's (who?) musical  \""Into the Woods\""  which has been broadcast on PBS - another channel not high on the list of the MTV or whatever generation  who will have enough information to get what's happening.So when yards of white hair are lowered from the inaccessible castle  who's going to get the reference? How old do you have to be these days? I've seen a number of critics complain about the plot. OK. Sorry. It's not straight from A to B  it's only revealed in bits. But there are significant clues all along the way  so if you were paying attention (Terry doesn't waste screen time  if it's in front of you  pay attention  it's important to the story) then you'll have a fair idea what's going on the second time you get to the village.The village is a marvel! It's pure brothers Grimm. At one point we see Hans and Greta (lost the l's?) in the forest dropping breadcrumbs and getting lost. Again  Gilliam has created a marvelously twisted version of the standard Grimm oeuvre  but kept many of the characters intact  just occupying slightly different territory.Oh  back to the plot for a moment...why are the children  girls  going missing? What is the terrible fate awaiting them? What is the engine below the surface that's driving this tale? All I can say is that not all the pieces are revealed in the first hour and a half  you have to stick around a might longer. The great news here is that you don't notice the time. I wasn't tempted to yawn once.As to Jonathan Price being annoying  I thought that was part of being a villain. And  given the storybook nature of the tale  some events are preordained (at least a little). 'Nuff said.So go see it. I'm going to see it again! (PS: I must congratulate the Weinstein's on not cutting out the prelude  which may have been a temptation  but would have seriously destroyed the continuity.)\tContrary to what I've been led to believe  'The Brothers Grimm' is actually not bad. It's not a really great movie  not one of those films that cast a spell on you  but it's fun. Don't expect anything but the basic amusement  and you'll enjoy it.Matt Damon and Heath Ledger play their main parts well  although I found myself slightly annoyed by them in certain points of the movie. Again  though  they played their parts very well. The supporting cast does an equally wonderful job.There are some pointless subplots in the movie  little details that are pretty but have little connection with the outcome. Still  the idea of the script is a good one - it's a light  fluffy fairytale that leads one to believing there is more.Trust me  there isn't.The soundtrack is eerily familiar  the melodies of well-known nursery rhymes changed into frightening tunes. There is no excessive use of computer graphics  which I take as a good thing. The costumes are well into the time period  although I hardly thing peasants could afford dentists to keep up such white teeth. The accents annoyed me a little  from the French fakes to the 'German' English. But those are little obnoxious details - nothing to worry about. Just sit back  turn off your brain  and relax.Two stars out of five."""
The Cave (2005),"The film had my heart thumping  my eyes bulging and my sense of Hollywood's stereotyping fulfilled from beginning to end. Arresting visuals both scenery and CGIs. Good looking set of modelesque actors and most importantly this movie contained a lot of footage of caving both subterranean and underwater. I might have preferred that this movie not have the predators as that would have devoted more time to the actual exploration of the caves but  in fairness  this wasn't the Discovery Channel. Film editing both sound and visuals were such that the movie created a high-paced suspension of disbelief  albeit much of the movie being relatively implausible. It  however  was not so ridiculously impossible that I could stomach the movie while I remained on the edge of my seat for the majority of it. Definitely worth seeing but don't get your hopes too high.\tHollywood is pretty good at this nonsense of releasing several films of the same nature within 6 months. Inevitably  one of them is always better than the other and here - where we have The Descent and The Cave... well  let's just say that if you saw The Descent  don't even bother with this.They aren't the same film  no but they're very similar. I mean  exactly how much leeway is there in a trapped-in-a-cave-with-monsters story? It's pretty much your standard monster fare  just trapped in a cave - so you have things like - the dark and... well  caving. This is where things differ from The Descent slightly  people are scuba diving all over the shop here Don't worry  the acting is all pretty horrible and there is plenty of that loathsome flickering-cut-every-second directing. There's perhaps one aspect of the film that might surprise you... but only if you're a dullard and it's not exactly novel.At the end of the day  the film amounts to little more than a generic monster film and if you want to see subterranean horror - I must surely recommend the far superior \The Descent\"".\ti went to see this film the other day.... i really like films that involve a bit of mystery  monsters and some jumpy scenes  but this film was just soooo slow and the only reason i stayed in the cinema was to see if they got out of the cave in the end...the plot was clever  thought out i would say but it wasn't at all jumpy or scary which i came to expect from the way the adverts made the film come across....i'd goto see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for a 3rd time than see this again  but i Really liked that film... :Di don't want to completely insult the film  its a good piece of directing and acting but just didn't entertain me personally...\tI'll agree with buffylover111 on the poor acting and predictability of the movie (man you just KNOW what's gonna happen next  no surprise at all) but if you're like me and just love monster movies you won't regret seeing it. Because of the creature's look and the general feel it reminded me of a cross between Aliens  Pitch black and The terror within. Although it's not very scary there's a lot of monsters who eat a bunch of people and it just what I want from that kind of film. I've given it 8 because although it's a great entertainment  the acting and the dialogs are just too bad and not even in a cheesy way  there's just plainly bad. In the last sequences  when they're in the last cave with the torch lit and the mist I thought they just walked into an Hercules set  it looked wrong.\tThe Cave starts out kind of intriguing  I've always loved the idea of spelunking  and discovering lost treasure and caves... but this movie lacked the atmosphere  and the treasure. It lacked the awe and mystique of discovery and gave too much too soon too little too late.Nowadays scary movie makers feel forced to come up with an ending that says 1 thing. \""This could be happening now  in your world.\"" The problem is  it's a formulaic scare tactic which often the case results in massive plot holes  and stupidity just to accomplish. This movie is no exception. We've seen it before; in Darkman  and Cabin Fever  and hundreds of other crappy movies.Not to mention a film with this thin a plot  and no real scares  will always fail because directing in such tight spaces requires talent  and it was obvious Bruce Hunt doesn't have any. I don't know about you but I hate watching a 100 minute film where I can only see what's going on for half the film. The creature was a ripoff of Alien  but that seems to be an epidemic in the new millennium. Uwe Boll fever.This movie was a lot of things  good is not one of them. Carrying elements from Pitch Black  Deep Blue Sea  and Aliens  i was bored to tears halfway through. Cole Hauser should know by now how to choose a role  but it's obvious he isn't looking for any Oscars.Movies aren't even worth seeing anymore.\t..still  this poor creature was a waste of that time. Clearly first-time director Hunt understands continuity as a relative concept--as in relatively nonexistent. The basic premise--escape from bloodthirsty monsters in the dark wet underground--could be scary in the right hands  but these are not those appendages. The underwater action is disjointed and poorly filmed  frustrating the viewer into filling in the gaps; the characters (all unrealistically attractive) connect with neither each other nor the audience  and the sole entertainment becomes a matter of guessing who will meet a sqawking demise next; after a while  the sight of yet another crew member being dragged feet first into an impossibly small opening elicits nothing but chuckles.The creature effects--in theory  Hunt's specialty--are workmanlike but redundant and pedestrian; a vast number of details are introduced but never explained.(What were those eels doing? Why is the church mosaic referenced  when the building containing them was destroyed 30 years earlier  and they should not have been visible? What on earth was the underground army of (dead) barbarians about?) The greatest complaints however  are reserved for the abysmal narrative structure: what are meant to be adrenaline-pumping chase scenes are badly undercut by bewildering illogic; characters switch locations without notice  vital equipment becomes lost only to show up a few scenes later; no one ever consults marks  compasses  or locaters  yet manage to thread their way through previously unseen passages to rejoin their companions. And I personally found distasteful a throwaway bit wherein two of the surviving characters  posited early on as the token love interest  engage in a CPR maneuver that requires him to rip open her wetsuit down to the waist. Eeee. The Abyss it is not.The final resolution  meant to be portentous  is merely silly. You'd have to see it for yourself to understand why  but I'd recommend that you spend the money on a decent lunch instead.\tThis movie is almost too horrible for words  but for the sake of you  the horror movie goer  I will issue a strict warning: THIS MOVIE SUCKS ASS!Just got out of the theatre  and I couldn't wait for the end. And let's talk about the ending. No  I won't give it away but let's just say  this movie borrowed from a mediocre adventure/sci fi/fantasy film called \""Reign of Fre\"". Now while I liked ROF okay  for a just released movie to steal so unabashedly from it  is just lame  cheesy  and stupid...I mean  god  I get angry when movies borrow from \""Alien\"" or \""Hellraiser\"" because those are incredible films. But come on  \""Reign of Fire\""?The directing was terrible  the script asinine  and the acting pathetic.The visual effects while pretty good  as usual  cannot save a film this bad.Watch at your own risk!\tThis film  although staying true to typical Hollywood thriller clich\u00e9s  does accomplish a few good things.By far the best thing about this film is the feeling of claustrophobia it puts upon the viewer. All of the tight spaces and underwater shots really made me feel ill at ease  which is a mark that a horror film is doing its job. For those of you who have seen the original Alien  it's a bit like that.....only in an underwater cave. (The creatures even share physical characteristics...from what you see of them...with Ridley Scott's space monsters).The film also creates tension in that the subject matter is a bit foreign  i.e. cave exploration. The characters wander around in an enormous underground maze  and unlike most horror flicks  you really can't think of an obvious solution. It's not a film where the characters stare blindly at an blatant remedy for their situation  and finally find it at the last second. The viewer feels just as lost as some of the characters (which  I will admit  becomes borderline annoying after a while) and thus  a good level of tension is created.Another neat little underlying device the film utilizes is the feeling of constantly being followed. Sound is a big part of this  in that the creepy  cricket-like chirping of the creatures follows the viewer throughout the entire film. A lot of the camera work (especially in the underwater scenes) adds to this effect.While the film's use of these devices is borderline brilliant  the rest of the movie is laughable. A hole-filled plot paired with disposable  static characters and unconvincing acting make the film another forgettable horror flick.The most frustrating thing of all is that the monsters are never fully shown. They are visible mostly in brief flashes. In the rare occasions when their entire forms make it on-screen  they are moving so fast that one still cannot get a good feel for what they would look like. I waited for that one big long shot where the hero stares down the monster  and it never came. Big disappointment here  and it made the film feel cheap.I'd say it's worth seeing in the theater  since it's only good points won't be done justice on your television (unless of course  you have a really nice home entertainment center). It's an entertaining film  and I do not regret going to see it. It's not one I would see again  however.\t\""The Cave\"" was disappointing in that it was never mildly entertaining as last summer's similar \""Anacondas\"" was. It was never clear to me exactly what the group was doing in the cave. The film was shot in a very dreary manner and the endless shots of the group diving  running and arguing with each other are never interesting  and quickly become annoying. The film's lead Cole Hauser seems even more bored than he did in \""Paparazzi\""  and displays no charisma whatsoever. The only actor that seemed credible was an athletic Piper Perabo  who did good in a climbing scene. Other than that there is little to recommend here. This can take its place next to \""Alone In The Dark\"" as the worst movie of 2005 so far.\tThe tag line says it all. \""There are places man was never meant to go.\"" and this movie is one of them. This is the latest in what must be the new refuge of the talentless director and cinematographer. When they don't have the knowhow or the skills for graphic depiction  ... they simply shake the camera. This brilliant advancement covers a number of sins  not the least of which are amateurish action sequences  and unimaginative monsters that look like leftovers from Godzilla Ate Hollywood. Enough already  at least hire a camera person who isn't going through withdrawals. The actors are presentable and do reasonably well with the insipid material. Some of the cave shots are worth a look  but not worth the price of sitting through this formulaic sci monster version of Ishtar Got Wet.\tNot sure where to even begin  there are so many negative reviews and comments that I find completely off base. I liked this movie  granted my wife and I went in with little expectation  we were pleasantly surprised. Those who say the action takes too long to begin are action junkies who care nothing for any attempt for characterization or story. We found the movie was well paced and thought out. Were there dark scenes? Yes   they're in a cave and under water. The story is a solid horror (reminded me a bit of \""The Relic\"" but in a cave :) Btw - this move has nothing to do with Alien  Vampires or Hell...I'm not sure how some critics actually get paid for their reviews? As expected Cole Hauser does a good job  as did the rest of the cast IMO. Those who bashed the so-called lack of char development...what do want? This is not a drama. You get just enough to flush out the story. I thought the creatures were well done(though I have to admit the film would of been better off with the freedom of an R rating) the editing of the PG-13 was a bit tight. But effective. And I have to say...I LOVED the ending! Was unexpected and I do hope more people ignore the critics and get out and see this movie. I look forward to the next movie. (as well as an un-cut Dir. Cut DVD!!! perhaps :)A side note...I feel that the majority who have seen this film and made comments didn't understand or catch the point of \""where\"" the creatures came from. That knowledge (imo) helps the story make more sense and enjoyable. Especially the ending :)So if you like suspense  horror  scifi-science  action this is a good solid \""B\"" movie!Much more entertaining and rewarding than The Brothers Grimm (which I \""really\"" wanted to like) but that's another review : )\tI am really quite happy that I went and saw this movie because it was really good! There was a good story line  and they made a good choice on choosing the people that they did for this movie. The Cave is a good horror movie because the producers tried a new spot  an underwater cave  as the main set. In the Alien Legacy the aliens were in outer space  in the Abyss they were an underwater colony near the ocean floor at several thousand feet. The cave was a first in putting the alien underground  but including water. The best thing I liked about this movie was that the leader of the group gets scratched by one of these giant bat-like creatures and starts to mutate into one of them. The ending also hints at a sequel  and I hope that the producers rise up to the challenge and make a sequel!\thello this my first review for a film. i have tried to not spoil scenes for you and write this critique of the structure of the film. this is my overall opinion of the film rather than pick apart certain scenes and spoil other peoples possible enjoyment of the film.just watched the cave and came out thinking that the writer/writers were lazy. they just came up with a premise then sat and watched other horror films and saw a scene and adapted it for quite a few scenes.the ending is telegraphed almost as clearly as in the sixth sense. the creatures seem to be hybrid of other screen monsters which makes them seem a little silly. with the plot line they devised they should have kept them simple they may have been more effective and scary.as a hardcore horror nut this film left me asking questions about the storyline. but to put my gripes to one side for a moment if you are not an avid horror fan you may like this film so i will not tell anyone to not watch it.at the end of the titles you may be left like thinking they could have done so much better with the film.p.s. if you have not watched it watch the descent after this.\tWARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I didn't really know what i was going to get with this but as i usually do i see the newest film at the latest showing poss on a Friday night. But 10mins into this film and i was wishing i'd stayed at home and watched a DVD. The acting was terrible the storyline was even worse. The cave magically enough was amazingly lit even though it was 1mile underground and most of the film was set more than 3miles away from the descent hole. The divers in the film had been diving with each other for years but when some of the group was being killed and lost they didn't really seem to care which just made the film seem even crapier.This is my first movie comment so don't know what else to say except this movie is really bad and you shouldn't go see it. Thanks for reading\tEXPLORING NEW DEPTHS...a review for The CaveThe Cave Columbia/Screen Gems 2005 Color 109 mins. Action-Horror Cole Hauser  Piper Perabo  Eddie Cibrian  Lena Headey and Morris Chestnut star. Directed by Bruce Hunt Rated PG-13 for language  violence and gore ***1/2(out of 5) First time helmer Bruce Hunt who was the second unit director on the Matrix films makes a valiant effort with the action horror spectacle The Cave. Brimming with classic suspense  an interesting story with a few unpredictable twists  decent performances  beautiful cinematograpghy and set design (I'm talking Oscar worthy) and taut direction this monster mayhem fest manages to reach new depths and be a cut above the rest. Sexy as Hell Cole Hauser( 2 fast 2 furious  Paparazzi) leads the cast of expert cave diving hotties which include feisty and surprising Piper Perabo (Coyote Ugly)  drool worthy Eddie Cibrian(Third Watch)  whiny Lena Headey(Gossip) and delecious Morris Chestnut(Anacondas). The film starts off thirty years ago ago as a group of explorers decide to explore a cave with a mythical history lying under a church. They are never heard from again. 30 years later the crew is brought together to explore the mmonstrous cavern. Soon after a tragic accident involving horrific subterrainian creatures leave them stranded together underground. Instead of staying still and awaiting their doom they decide to explore the caverns and try and find another way out before there supplies run out. But something awaits them in the dark. Something monstrous  something hungry. The film is a fairly standard horror pic reminiscent of other underwater thrillers such as Levaiathan and Deep star six. Although it never reaches those entertaining depths it does manage to go in a completely opposite direction and explore new depths of originality. Ultimately just a rip of Alien. Hunt starts the film fairly slow trying desperately to build the characters and their relations. He succeeds somewhat but the film really doesn't grab your interest in any way. Besides the apparent eye candy the film is terribly sluggish in it's first half. Than something interesting happens the action picks up  we care about the characters and there's suddenly a truckload of suspense thats unleashed. Boiling over with exciting action sequences and interesting plot twists the film begins to become one hell of an edge of your seat nail biter. On a technical level the film is photographed beautifully. The underwater cinematograpghy as well as the cave's set design is absolutely extraordinary and breath taking. Mixed with a bundle of structured colors and film textures the film presents itself as a mosaic work of art. Hunt does well with his first outing but leaves room for much improvement some of his editing and directorial choices seem slightly lacking in pace  believability and continuity. However in a film like this lapses in logic are to be expected and to fully enjoy this film and all it has to offer you just need to let yourself go. Also credit must be given for a film of it's subject matter to be played straight forward with hardly any humor. So that we can take the film as seriously and realistically as possible. The only real problem the film has is the insepid and unnecessary conclusion involving a clich\u00e9d and unbelievable twist. All in all a positive victory for all involved and a welcome addition to it's genre.\they kids  being a 35 y/o here  i thought this movie was amazing. i have seen millions of movies and this one takes the cake..dunno something about it just grabbed out at me and made me goto the theaters 3 more times to watch it..just so frig-gen awesome. . also  its crazy how when the creature comes to life and attacks all the cave-men  i mean cm-on  how awesome is that!! . lemme know what you guys think? your takes? it was just an amazing show! . i think that if i have to keep adding random stuff to this just to make it 10 lines   I'm gonna have to go rate another movie just like it.. go out and buy this movie as soon as it comes out \""! you will not be disappointed i promise..it is such a worthwhile investment!\tThis movie was great! I was highly anticipating the release of it months ago. The story of cave explorers going down in one of the deadliest caves is an interest grabber. The monsters looked sub par to being realistic  but the special effects entranced me at moments during the film. The acting isn't as terrible as some reviews given by critics on yahoo and such stand offish views are often expressed because of having a closed mind. This movie reminded me a lot of Alone in the Dark and also reminises of the film \""The Relic\"". The Relic was an older movie  but along very similar lines. If you liked The Relic or Alone in the Dark  The Cave is a must see!\tthe concept doesn't miss anything.the team leader's way of making people agree with him(along with the support of his brother) and how paradoxical the path to escape are what i remember scene by scene-the emphasis definitely gets to the audience.however when the team is being chased by the demonic looking creatures it looks way too shaky to follow making it almost impossible to look at the screen because you can't see anything clearly.other than that since 'beneath hell lied the cave' i expected to see more of those 'bad guys' after all they've been there for centuries supposedly without disturbances from the outside world. overall it's an exciting movie and i had a really good time watching it.\tHaving seen the trailer for this after going to see Unleashed I decided that this film would be worth the money to go see in the cinema. If you go to see this film be prepared for a lacklustre film. This film is best seen in the cinema because of the atmosphere created by the big screen and by the surround sound. The rest of the film is filled with some really stupid dialogue and several cheesy scenes.However saying that the back story is quite interesting... well the back back story or the legend of the cave. Thats the interesting bit. Unfortuanatly its mentioned briefly in the start of the film and then thrown away as a means of escape near the end. This film will be pulled from cinemas soon i think and coming to a DVD bargain bin near you by Christmas. After all..... *SPOILER COMING UP* ........after all when you see a picture of the creature/demon and it has wings do you really expect a member of the cast to scream 'It can fly!' no! I wanted to scream at the screen 'What do you think its wings for'. However the worse part of the film is the end which is just straight out of Hollywood and is completely unoriginal  i saw it coming from miles off and unfortunately it means there will most likely be a sequel.In closing... I enjoyed some parts but most of this movie was weak  contrived and completely unoriginal. I would recommend it if its all your cinema is showing really.\tI know not a lot of people are going to see this until it comes out on DVD  which is a shame  because this is precisely why there are less and less horror movies that are released in theaters.Anyway- The Cave is an awesome monster movie. There has been that trend lately  of horror movies being shot and intended for am \""R\"" release  but then get cut down to a PG-13  only to be release as \""Unrated\"" on DVD. Problem being  when you're watching them in the theaters  it feels like you're watching a movie that wanted to be more  but had itself gutted.Yes  The Cave is rated PG-13  but I never felt I was watching a movie that was heavily edited. The was just enough blood so you realize what's going on  but the action moved too fast to really linger. Part of the fun is being in the dark (figuratively speaking) with the characters. I think the only thing missing for an \""R\"" pic was bad language.The creatures were awesome  and you saw just enough to get an idea of what they looked like  while still being in enough shadow to still make you curious as to what they REALLY looked liked. (On a side note- though they never say it  and nor is it heavily hinted at  the creatures are a cool way of explaining early stories of vampires  being that the story takes place in the Carpathian Mountains...) I saw the ending coming from miles away  but I still liked it  and thought that it was the way to end the film.So  I liked it a lot. It's not everybody's cup o' tea  and not terribly original  but it's a damn good monster movie."""
The Constant Gardener (2005),"\City of God\"" director  Fernando Meirelles  does NOT disappoint with his film translation of the John Le Carr\u00e9 novel \""The Constant Gardener.\"" His treatment of the violence is on par with \""COG.\"" Subtly shown  emotionally felt  yet not glorified. In comparing the slums I've personally seen in South America  I'm drawn to the Kenyan slums on film  because of the way Fernando renders them. Yes  they are terrible  but you really don't want to look away. Unfortunately  I have not read the novel; therefore I cannot draw conclusions (this situation will be remedied next week).Major kudos to Ralph Fiennes for choosing Fernando Meirelles as director and to Richard McCabe  Pete Postlethwaite  Rachel Weisz  Bill Nighy  Hubert Kound\u00e9  Gerard McSorley for a job well done \u0096 they're a fabulous cast. \""The Constant Gardener\"" is a visually alive  emotionally moving film  not as ferocious as \""City of God\"" but thought-provoking nonetheless.Personally  I found Mr. Meirelles focused  curious  not at all jaded & cynical  down-to-earth  warm and compassionate. He conducted a Q&A after the screening of \""The Constant Gardener\"" in Washington  DC last night. At the post-screening reception  Mr. Meirelles graciously made himself accessible to all attendees. I hope the lovely people of Venice accept \""The Constant Gardener\"" to their festival!! Mr. Meirelles is currently making a new movie that  through the effects of globalization  unites 5 different stories of people  spanning a myriad of cultures in Brazil  China  Kenya  NYC and the desert. Best of Luck!\tI think the director and the script were a bad match.The dynamic shooting style that he so brilliantly applied to City of God feels inappropriate in service of this rather conventional  overlong  dialogue-driven international thriller.Extreme camera angles and moves are favored over acting and interpersonal drama. These are great actors  but they've been better in other movies. I don't think the director is quite up to the task of directing a mature  \""adult\"" film.And the script is a bit of a mess as well. Too much preachy  naive & on-the-nose dialogue. And the dialogue is doing too much of the dramatic heavy lifting: too much of the crucial action is off-screen or merely referred to in dialogue instead of SHOWN On screen! It felt like a rough draft of what could have been a much better script.Fiennes' character is not very well defined  so when the movie shifts from being her story to his  we're not attached enough to him to care.And there is no real suspense or mystery to his journey: we already pretty much know everything there is to reveal.This leads to an insufferably boring and overlong second half.So much talent here  but mismatches and an underdeveloped script sink it.Don't buy the self-important ads  this one doesn't deliver.\tCrisp and heartfelt thriller that gives you the right shot in the arm with an Oscar caliber performance by Rachel Weisz and an equally Oscar worthy performance by Ralph Fiennes. This is a film about the horrors of big business and the way they are willing to experiment on the poor to achieve their goals. Rachel Weisz plays Tessa  A feisty activist who uncovers a conspiracy by a pharmacy company to test experimental drugs on the poor natives of Africa. She then tries to fight them and expose the conspiracy until she is brutally murdered. Her husband  a quite diplomat then begins to take up her cause and try to give his departed wife justice while trying to uncover the hard truth of what is going on.Fernando Meirelles Follow up his masterpiece \"":City of God\"" with an equally satisfying journey of self-discovery  love and Justice. Ralph Fiennes owns the role of Justin and he takes you into the center this thrilling journey and into the center of his soul as well. The real showstopper here is the performance of Rachel Weisz  who gives the right balance of self-righteousness  heart and determination with her role. Weisz makes you believe in the film and makes you equally as determine as Justin and she was in uncovering the conspiracy and uncovering the true about what had happen to her.This is one of the best films of the year and if there is any justice in the world  this baby would be nominated to the hill with Oscars and Rachel Weisz would get one as well because her performance is easily the best performance of any actor we have had all this year.\tI saw this movie at a Q&A (with the director) screening Sunday night in Lincoln Center. I would say it was good movie but not a great one.It seemed to me that the film was trying to do and be too many things  so the emotional impact it had on me was far less than what I think it should have been  given the basic story and quality of the performances. I never read the book  so I can't compare the film to it.I think my major problems were these: 1.The way the story is told never enabled me to really feel the level of love that was supposed to exist between \""\""Justin\"" (Ralph Fiennes) and \""Tessa\"" (Rachel Weisz)  and it was this love that was supposed to enable \""Justin\"" to change and choose the course of action that is the center of the story- the protagonist's \""quest\"".2.While the scenes of the conditions the Kenyans and Sudanese (I believe that a later scene was shot in Sudan) live under made me feel sympathy (and to some degree  guilt)  there wasn't one main character who was a native of this environment- they were nameless faces who were supposed to symbolize the results of the exploitation and corruption that victimize Africa and her people. (I don't think the doctor who \""Tessa\"" worked with was native to that area.) So  while I felt bad in the same way I would if I were watching the nightly news  it's not the same level of connection I would feel if there had been some well-defined characters- even one- who could have defined \""who \"" as opposed to \""what\"" \""Tessa\"" was fighting for.Because the movie has a mystery element to it  \""Tessa's\"" full motives  by virtue of both the narrative form and needs  retains a degree of mystery  and to me  this made her character seem somewhat aloof  underdeveloped and one-note  although I have no problem with Rachel's portrayal of her. She is quite an engaging actress; reminds me a lot of Kate Winslet .The most successful part of the film to me  despite the roadblocks I mentioned  was Ralph Fienne's beautiful performance. His work here is very internal  subtle and understated  and I found it quietly moving and powerful. Although \""the too much going on\"" I referred to causes a competition of sorts among the elements for what the focus of the film should be- a murder mystery? A love story? An exploration and indictment of government and corporate greed being able to flourish unnoticed in Africa because nobody cares? The director's formidable skill in using flashback  visuals and sound to create auras of haunting memories  mystery  and suspense?- it is Fienne's moving portrayal of an English gentleman who experiences his emotions quietly as he pieces together what has happened that emerges from all of these vying elements as the center of this film.\tI saw it at a screening recently and was drawn into this great film from the very opening shot. The director does a great job of telling a complex story in an interesting way. His pace and visual technique kept the film moving in a languid yet urgent way (I say this because I remember thinking that there were very few quick cuts in the film  yet I never felt the \""drag\"" that is usually associated with bad pacing). The cast was first rate and the script gave them lots to work with. Mr. Fiennes will likely get an Oscar nod for his performance  it reminded me of his great work in \""The English Patient\"". Rachel Weisz was great too  but I felt she didn't get enough screen time to truly show off her talents.I hope it reaches a wide audience.\tFilms that are written as thrillers  suspense stories and romances all feature certain story elements that define the genre. How the elements are combined to tell a specific story is the measure of a story's success at convincing an audience of its worth. \""The Constant Gardener\"" is a well-crafted story with many fine performances  starting with Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz  and including the many character actors who make this film feel viscerally real and true. In the tradition of films like \""Silkwood\""  \""Z\"" and\"" The Insider\""  the director of \""City of God\"" takes the audience on a tense  suspenseful ride with characters who dare tell truth to power. The film viewing experience feels dangerous and worth-while. No doubt  \""The Constant Gardener\""  like \""City of God\"" will fuel discussion about the politics which is the basis of this film  and will also send more people to read John Le Carre's book  which is the basis of the film.\tGreat romantic thrill ride that is made even more special by the performances of Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes  who both give this adaptation of the John Le Carre book a real sense of beauty  dignity and grace with their on target performances. Weisz is perfection as Tessa Qualye  a civil rights activist who is murdered for trying to bring awareness of their illegal practices on the poor natives of an African village. Weisz gives her character a self-righteous drive that is made poignant by her determination and sheer will and she also makes her character human  not a stereotype  which makes her performance the more real. Ralph Finnes plays her grieving husband Justin  who takes up her cause and begins to lean of how wonderful his wife really was and what he missed during the time she was alive. His haunted performance is in my opinion his best ever and is the driving point of this haunting odyssey of justice  lost and self sacrifice. Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes both deserve Oscar nominations for their superb performances and Fernando Meirelles deserves one as well for his superb direction that puts you smack in the middle of the story that is unfolding right in front of you.Hands down  the best film of the year so far.\tOver the years I have come to think of Peter Travers as the most clueless movie critic in the media. When I see a rave review by him  I am forewarned. He raved about this movie. I was forewarned. I went anyway. Foolish me. This movie was bad on almost every level. Maybe every level. It was shot in a cinema verite way that was trying to be artistic but only succeeded in being annoying. It was long  boring and had such a fizzle of a payoff that I would have felt cheated if I hadn't given up hope for this mess long before the ending. The message part of the movie was slathered on with a trowel and akin to those World Help ads that you see on Sundays on TV. The movie handled it's delivery so poorly that I was on the side of the evil drug companies and beginning to think that maybe Mugabe has a point. As opposed to the English Patient which had the more discerning in the audience screaming at Feinnes  \""Die already\""  this movie had me wanting to scream  \""Kill him already.\"" And I won't spoil it by telling you if they did or not. It's spoiled long  long before you find out one way or another anyway.\tIntelligent and moving political thriller that should be held right up there with \""All The Presidents Men\"" and \""The Killing Fields \"" as one of the best political thrillers ever made. Fernando Meirelles tops his last directional effort with a thriller that is moving  scary and down right forthright in it's views of big companies gone wrong and the horrors that they are willing to inflect on others for the sake of profit. Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes give career best performances in this film and that's a huge compliment considering the fact that they are good in almost everything they do  even in bad movies. Weisz is strong willed and obsessive and Fiennes is determine and endearing and both of them compliment each other with there destine to be award winning chemistry and acting chops. The director compliments both of them with a view of Africa that is rarely seen in film and a sense of reality that is only found in real life.Rachel Weisz  Ralph Fiennes and Fernando Meirelles all should be honored at award season for their amazing efforts in this film because as of right now  this is with out a doubt the film to beat come Oscar time.\tI walked away from The Constant Gardener wondering how drug companies actually bench test their drugs. (The current Vioxx settlement certainly inspired cynicism) This is a thriller for the thinking crowd \u0096 with sufficient chase scenes and action sequences to justify the genre. It's paced slower then the average Grisham or Ludlum (Jason Bourne) movies I've come to love. But if you're interested in the stark realities of how medicines are tested in third world nations without having to endure negative consequences  this is a film you will want to see. It purports to reveal real-world events from Africa.Pharmaceutical company corporate greed and compromised government ethics set the mood as Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz (on separate courses) do what they can to reveal the corruption spinning all around them. Fiennes is a British diplomat who understands what it takes to succeed in a compromising diplomatic position. Weisz refuses to give in. She's on a mission to reveal the truth - taking the political activist route - from the moment they meet. Fiennes is a love interest to the luscious Weisz  someone who offers an opportunity to cut the red tape and speed the truth about the mischief to which the drug company(s) are up to in Africa.It's a brilliant movie showcasing how third world countries are (or can be) exploited. It deals with how a major pharmaceutical firm conducts harmful tests on ignorant  unsuspecting Kenyans. We see the other side of Africa \u0096 the side unseen in the enticing Kenyan safari tourist posters.This is a thriller that thrills both the mind as well as the spirit. It left me wondering  \""how close to the truth did they actually come?\""\tNot absolutely sure if there is a spoiler herein  but to be safe  please be warned  since this film is  on one level  a mystery drama. One the many wonderful aspects of this film is watching Justin (Fiennes) grow from a detached  kind-hearted  naif to a sad  wise person of the world. And in true LeCarre style  no one is what they seem to be  which adds to the suspense element. The director is also responsible for the remarkable and very hard-hitting \""City of God\"". Now this film comes along and it makes me want to know more about him. He certainly is able to deliver a powerful social message along with a great story. Not many can do that without sounding like they're preaching. I don't want to reveal too much  so I urge you simply to walk into the theater and let this film catch you up in its frenetic  urgent and beautiful style.Ten stars.\tThis is a must see film for anyone who's interested in being entertained  intellectually challenged  and moved well after they've left the theater. Although a work of fiction  much of the movie's elements center on true-to-life themes that receive some  but perhaps not enough  press. The photography and on-location filming in Kenya and elsewhere is absolutely stunning in and of itself. The vivid color and boundless life and poverty of Kenyan slums to the many non-actor Africans were an extremely vivid touch and really added an element of thoughtfulness to the film. Truly amazing and well worth many times the cost of the ticket.\tHere's my capsule review of \""The Constant Gardener\"" \""The Bourne Identity Goes to Africa and Leaves Behind All the Chase/Fight Scenes and A-Level Scriptwriters\"" I went to this movie based on its 78% Tomatometer rating (http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/constant_gardener/) and quickly realized that it was a combination of political grandstanding and Oscar-grubbing at the expense of entertainment.If you're still interested in watching this movie  be warned: It is not a \""thriller\"" by any means. It's definitely \""Oscar caliber\"" but that doesn't make it good. It's pretty much your standard evil-corporation conspiracy movie  except the scriptwriters took care to calibrate it perfectly in the sights of the Academy and strip away anything that might distract the Academy voters like action or comedy or plot exposition. You could almost see the checklists going through the head: 1) British actors. Can't have those vulgar colonials messing up our movies. British people sound smarter than the rest of us  which rubs off on your movie.2) Relevant news issue \""fictionalized\"" for our consumption. (See The Interpreter). Who needs an ad campaign or scriptwriters when you've got stuff happening in the real world 3) Complete Absence of Action or Comedy. Oscar-winning movies transcend entertainment.4) Steadicams and Crazy Camera Angles. Motion sickness means good movies.5) Obligatory Anti-Bush Screed. In the first 20 minutes of the film. Remember  the war in Iraq is bad and the UN is good. THE WAR IN IRAQ WAS WRONG AND THE UN IS GOOD. END OF STORY.Fernando Meirelles could have made a thriller with emotion - Paul Greengrass did it with Bourne Supremacy and Doug Liman did it with Mr. And Mrs. Smith. Instead  he chose to push the \""Liberal Guilt\"" button until it broke. How many more movies do we need to see about evil white people ravaging non-white countries for their own benefit? Hasn't this been done before? Why does it take 2 hours and 10 minutes of our time for us to uncover what is clear as day? We all know who the bad guy is. There's no mystery after the first 30 minutes of the film. After that  I found myself looking at my watch. I fond that too much time had gone by without anything to break the monotony  which is a VERY BAD THING in a movie that is billed as a \""thriller\"". There's nothing thrilling about a movie that has no action. It's even less thrilling to endure 2 hours and 10 minutes of plot being advanced slowly and lugubriously by people talking.I don't pay $9.00 to watch people talking to one another. I can get that at home for free. I pay for spectacle and I was getting a travelogue narrated by people I didn't particularly care for because they didn't do anything at all! I haven't even touched on the lack of realism in this film. Basically it's about an evil drug company that's somehow got the British Government on its side  leaving dead bodies all over Africa. Probably the most offensive part about Fernando Meirelles' story is that it portrays corporations and intelligence agencies as one-dimensional omniscient/omnipotent killers. Here's news for you  chump - You are not Rev. Pat Robertson. Having people killed is harder than it looks on Mission: Impossible. Naturally all the people important to the plot survive  despite the apparent ease which the villain dispatches its enemies. In fact  the hero gets captured by henchmen who rough him up as some sort of warning to keep his mouth shut  despite the obvious conflict between leaving someone alive and expecting them to be quiet.Bottom line: I would be pleasantly surprised if a portion of this film's profits went to a good cause  because only a true Hollywood executive can appropriate a \""good cause\"" in the name of his shareholders.\tRather than offering the same contrived review that most people simply skim through  I am going to evaluate the movie based on several categories. Each category will be given a grade (A thru F) accordingly.Directing: Awhy: Fernando Meirelles (City of God) repeats in Oscar-worthy fashion. Without giving anything away  the structure of this movie is incredible. Cinematography: Awhy: Meirelles and Cesar Charlone combine a thrilling adventure with one of the most phenomenal displays of cinematography I've ever seen.Plot: B+why: while the first 3/4 of the movie are exhilarating as any  the last twenty-five or so minutes of the movie couldn't keep up the high suspense. Script: B+ why: the film takes place in London and Kenya and the script complies  and very well at that.Acting: Awhy: Ralph Fiennes is obvious the new Liam Neesom. Fiennes delivers a stellar performance and SHOULD be a top candidate for Best Actor in 2006. However  Rachel Weisz stole the show. I was amazed are her ability to maintain the emotion and power throughout. Wow.Editing: Awhy: editing was on par with directing and cinematography - maybe even above it. The editing and mish-moshing of scenes was AMAZING and ranks among the top 10 I've ever seen.Music: A-why: the original score fit the movie. not much else to say about that.Overall Grade: Aa touching  exciting film shot with such beautiful creativity that it'd be a shame if people ignored it. it's movies like this that will be remember through time  not the horrid garbage the mainstream public wastes their $10 per ticket on. SEE THIS MOVIE  YOU WILL ENJOY IT.\tA marvelously photographed film that serves to remind us that there is more to that great continent of Africa than we tend to imagine  and this film (and the book it was based on) serves as a pointed critique of how we (the wealthy countries of the world) see and treat those of whom we know and care so little. But much of the intrigue is in the cloak and dagger narrative and the political machinations it describes and alludes to. What made this a superior film was how these issues were deftly handled and compellingly presented by a top notch cast and careful direction making large issues intimately meaningful so that you come away with lots to talk about  and caring about something you can seek to change. Sprawling sentences just to say: great film  great cast. Weisz and Fiennes have great chemistry. Weisz's rant when Fiennes' and her character first meet was brilliant.\tThis film is a cross between \""The Insider\"" and \""Hotel Rwanda\"". Ralph Fiennes plays Justin Quayle  an English diplomat assigned to Kenya; whose wife  Tessa (Rachel Weisz)  is on a mission. She is idealistic and wants to make a difference. The problem is she does not know what she is up against.Based on the best-selling John le Carr\u00e9 novel and directed by Fernando Meirelles (the Academy Award-nominated director of \""City of God\"")  this movie is a strong drama of a woman's fight to make a difference in Africa. Because if she doesn't  who will? This movie really illustrates the harsh conditions of Northern Kenya and how cheap life really is in all of Africa. It demonstrates how with the right backing  large corporations can get away with almost anything. Almost anything.Both Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz are good in this movie. They really convince you that they care foe one another. While at the same time  they contend with their own struggles.\tTried to watch The Constant Gardener in a preview show tonight. I say try  because the camera work was so jumpy. Even in a scene in an apartment with two people talking to each other  the focus went in and out and you got distracted by watching the door-frame go from the top of the screen to six or seven inches below. As if this was not enough  it then proceeded to go from side to side. The scene of the train sped from station  to bridge  to tunnel  to trestle  to bridge to trestle  to tunnel  enough to make my cast-iron stomach do flip flops. Add this to the flashbacks that kept occurring with no rhyme or reason or explanation. It could have been a great movie. Hiding somewhere in the middle of all this jumping around is a great story. What a shame it was so poorly produced.\tThis film was very moving. While there were a few plot holes and extraneous details  the film flowed well  and I found myself rooting for Fiennes first to find his backbone  and then to find the truth. In some ways I was reminded of The English Patient  not only because Fiennes was in both films  and that he lost the woman he loved  but because of his quiet desperation  his struggle to be the man he never thought he could be  to become what he most admired in his wife.As a former aid worker in southern Africa  this film resonated with me in many ways  though I think it can appeal to a wide  literate audience.\tWhat is this film? A drama or an accusing documentary? On the one side there is this documentary touch to it  accentuated by a constant wobble of the picture due to handycam. On the other side  there's this unnerving drama between two people that is completely unnecessary for the uncovering of the pharma-scandal (which is  to be honest  by far not the worst thing that is being done to these people by our industry...) Too much drama (a very unnecessary dramatic ending)  too little facts and I didn't like the fact that the film starts with the death of the protagonist. As you know the end from the beginning there's no suspense in that part of the plot.\tJohn Le Carre's novels (Absolute Friends  Single & Single  The Russia House  The Tailor of Panama  etc.) are intelligent  prescient  witty  and have contained the most insight into global politics for decades. He wrote this in the years prior to 2000 and released it in 2000  and you will be amazed by its timeliness today. This adaptation of The Constant Gardener rivals The Russia House in terms of honesty to the novel  great performances  great locations  suspense  great direction  etc. This is truly a great movie that you will savor for a long while. The director is excellent and the cinematography and photography are creative. The lead performances will stay with you. You will see this movie at Oscar time. There is nothing like reading Le Carre's novels (or listening to him read an unabridged audio version!) - but this movie adaptation envelops and astounds."""
The Crow: Wicked Prayer (2005),"The Crow kicked @$$  however this movie sucked @$$. The acting was awful  the dialog was awful. Dennis Hoppers character was probably the worst. Using gang slang for no reason other than the script writer not having any idea what the hell they were talking about. \shorty\""? \""baddass homeboy\""?. I'm not even sure why they went this route or what it had to do with anything. The first part of the movie was almost alright but by the end of the flick I wanted to destroy the DVD and return it to blockbuster so no one else would ever be able to watch it. DIALOG  ACTING  PLOT  and CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT ALL SUCKED. The only part interesting was watching the special features afterwords and watching the actors and director talk about the film like they thought it was a good flick.\tIs this movie for real. Why did they even bother to produce this movie. The acting was unconvincing  the cast unable to personify their characters. The plot was predictable  rushed and scattered. Unfortunately the crow angle just doesn't work any more. All the movie did was take the first crow movie and changed actors  location and sound track. If you cant beat the original or come close then just leave it alone. Boreanaz and Reid just don't cut it as bag guys and sometimes I was confused with Reid's character's motivation. Was she bad and sometimes repentant and if so why considering she tried to come across as sadistic. And what was with The Crows face mask? Where they budgeting on the eyeliner.\tWhat can I say about The Crow: Wicked Prayer..... As a fan of the original movie  I had thought that City of Angels was complete blasphemy  but then there was \""Prayers\"" if you weren't an Atheist before  this movie just might convince you. With it's riveting or revolting cinematography and it's unexceptional cast  one definitely understands WHY this was a direct to DVD release. I rented it completely out of a sense of completion. Eddie Furlong brings a sexually ambiguous angle to the crow  contorting his face at times to resemble someone passing a Lincoln Log (my apologies for the graphic imagery). David \""Bored\""ianus was as cheesy as all Hell! (Pun intended). Dennis Hopper delivers stimulating quotes such as \""We're kickin' our Homey down  our hardcore banger LucG here\"" and \""I now pronounce you devil and his shorty\""...Hmm and I think that's it...no wait TARA RIED! She was completely forgettable in her role as evil pop-tart (I'm sure that fact will help her career). I had thought it might be bad... but even \""I\"" hadn't expected this! The Crow: Wicked Prayer-Pathetic...Ridiculous....Crap!!!\tLet me just start by saying this movie was okay. It wasn't a blow you away type movie. The acting is just terrible. The only person who carries the movie is Furlong. Tara Reid really brings the movie down. And out of the four Crow movies I would have to say Wicked Prayer would come in 4th place. The first Crow excellent!!! Then you have City of Angles I would put that in 3rd place. And Salvation coming in 2nd. I think Salvation was the most different of the four. But anyway  Wicker Prayer doesn't do anything to ruin The Crow franchise. I love these movies. You can't compare the actors who have played The Crow cause they all bring their own sense of style and charisma. Brandon Lee as Eric Draven of course if my favorite. But the other three did a good job also. So what I am just saying is if you like the crow movies you will like this one. Just don't expect it to be excellent.\tAt the beginning  they summed up the situation as it was with a couple of written lines of description. Therefore  I immediately thought 'Ahh hell' and settled in for a badly written story that couldn't explain itself. For the first twenty minutes  I wasn't disappointed. After that though  it picked up rapidly.You never make the mistake of taking the film too seriously (Which  given its origins in Crow 1 as a pseudo-horror could be a bad thing)  but its not 'A laugh a minute'.There are no plot twists - which given a lot of films in recent years is actually a relief  the bad guys are bad to the end - though all except the main villain show moments of doubt.I will say though  Luc Crash's character - or more particularly  what happens to him  is never fully explained till near the end. There's also not much confrontation going on between The Crow and the bad guys...Still  on the whole  I'd have to say it was definitely an enjoyable film that I will watch again one day relatively soon  and far better than the last two Crow films.\tI voted an 8 because of my total bias towards Mr. David Boreanaz. He's got a life-long fan in me thanks to \""ANGEL\""  and I will continue to support anything he does  including his upcoming series \""Bones\"".The film was all right  a bit sloppy in places  a few plot points (such as the past history of the characters) could have been explained a little more  and I understand the budget wasn't very high  but damn if Boreanaz steals the show with an intense insanity that is a joy to watch. There are times when he is downright evil and scary  and times when his character is so deluded with the sense of power that he literally goes mad  and while I understand the threw many viewers off  I found that made up for the film's shortcomings because he was so entertaining.Did I mention I am a little biased?\tMy hopes were high for this 4th Crow feature  as I had been tracking it's progress for almost 2 years prior to it's release. What a waste of 2 years.The Crow: Wicked Prayer is a poor quality b-grade movie bordering on c-grade. The direction is poor and the casting is weak. As always Tara Reid over acts to the point of ridiculousness (that's what Tara Reid does best) and Edward Furlong doesn't have the slightest clue about the torment behind his character. David Boreanez is hugely miscast as a Satanic Cult Leader but does the best with what he has to work with. As has been the case in the past 10 years  Dennis Hopper delivers another contrived and pathetic cameo performance trying to revive his \""Cool Man!\"" hippie style dialog which made him famous.I fear it is too late for The Crow franchise to pick itself up. The first two films in the series have an artistic  neo-Gothic richness to them but the last two movies in the series look made for TV at best. I appreciate that they attempted to change the formula somewhat by moving it's location to the dessert and filming it mostly by day light... but they failed. I am not a prude by any means  but there was way too much unnecessary course language coming from characters who didn't deliver the words with conviction. Perhaps if they decide for one more attempt  they should consider using a more established director and return to a dark Gothic atmosphere. Perhaps also having the Crow be a female!? Whatever the case  The Crow: Wicked Prayer has a cool name but the rest is tripe. Worth buying from a bargain bin for those intent on having the complete collection of Crow movies.\tI am a Crow fan and after seeing the sequels  just like most of you  I knew NOT to expect much out of this. Although I must say this is a MUCH better effort than the last 2. I DO believe that there will never be another Crow movie to even compare to the first  but IF they decide to make good ones  then I think they should  but if they are gonna just sit around and count on Crow fans like me to buy every movie regardless  then maybe they just retire while they're ahead. Unlike the other 2 sequels I only have a few complaints about this one: 1. I have to agree about the Dennis Hopper  although I am a fan of him  doesn't really feel right in this movie  I can't really determine why  I just know I was sitting there thinking  Why are you here? 2. Tara Reid  enough said 3. Once again  it is almost the same story  although a good one  still the same  I would like to see a newer more innovative storyline come out of future Crows  if there will be any. I understand that The Crow has to be one of the hardest stories to expand upon  but if you can't do it  then just don't make the movie.There were a lot of good things though  but i'm not gonna make a list  what I really want to get across is this though...FINALLY SOMEONE (other than Brandon Lee) PLAYED THE CROW LIKE THEY ACTUALLY WANTED TO BE/CARED ABOUT THE CHARACTER. At first I was unsure if Edward Furlong was gonna be up to this  but now  I think he has come the closest since Brandon Lee  which is definitely good news  this was a rare occasion was I was happy to be proved wrong. Also  even though I said early that the story seems too rehashed  even though it seems rehashed it definitely is the best rehash  thus far.Overall though  I must say that if you have been burnt by the last 2  like us all  just give this one a try  at least in this one there is an EFFORT  to make it good  it doesn't even come close to the first but BY FAR is the second best of this series........Kudos\tThe Crow: Wicked Prayer boldly steps out of the box  and takes the series into a completely different direction  bringing much needed fresh air to the series. By far  this is the best sequel.Story: Ex-con Jimmy Cuervo and his girlfriend Lily  are picked by Luc Crash and his gang to be used in a ritual to make Luc the Devil himself. Little does Luc know  Jimmy is raised from the dead by the crow to seek revenge and stop the evil ceremony. Plagued with anger from his past  and grieving the loss of his love  Jimmy sets out to make the wrong things right. The film has several sub-plots  including a feud between the Indians and the White Men  and villain back stories. A different story  and I liked it.Directing: Lance Mungia did a fantastic job with the severely limited budget that he had. The mood  pacing  and setting was wonderful. There are some truly breathtaking shots of scenery. My only complaint is how well lit everything was. Mungia has great style  and I look forward to seeing some of his future work. I can only imagine what this guy could do with a decent budget.Acting: Here is where the movie shines. Edward Furlong(Jimmy Cuervo) played the part of Jimmy well. There is a lot of anger in his performance  which I think fits the character quite well. I really felt for him  and his emotional scenes have a real impact on the viewer. David Boreanaz(Luc Crash) really stole the show for 3/4 of the movie. He plays a bad guy well  and nailed every line he had. His presence is amazing. However  in the last act  when he becomes Satan  he severely overacts. Someone should have told him to calm down. Tara Reid(Lola Byrne) did surprisingly well. Usually she's awful  in this  she's just not that great. Overall  all the actors did an excellent job  the worst being Dave Ortiz.Score: Jamie Christopherson composed an amazing score. The music in this film is my favorite  second only to the first. It draws you in  and holds you in the scenes.Violence: The violence is pretty constant. However  it is either off-screen  or for the most part  bloodless. We get some down and dirty brawls  stabbings  shootings  light blood  a heart rip  and a somewhat juicy impaling.Profanity/Sexual Themes: The language is used throughout  and it quite vulgar. There is some light sexual content  though on nudity  or anything like that.Substance Abuse: There is a scene in which the characters get high off of peyote  but it is done in a very stylish way.Overall: The Crow: Wicked Prayer is by far the best of the sequels. It is a rocking good time  with action  emotion  and passion. I really enjoyed the flick. Worth a look for any fan boy  or someone looking for an action movie with heart. If only the budget hadn't been so tiny  the film could have totally blown me away. 9/10\tWhoever thought of casting Ed Furlong in the lead of a Crow movie should be banned from the industry. With the makeup on  he looks like an ugly Goth chick. There isn't a person in the world who would buy him as \""The Crow\"" or any other comic book hero. he's a wimpy looking kid who looks like he would lose in a fight to one of the Olson twins  let alone any \""bad guys.\"" In fact  the whole movie is poorly cast. Everyone is awful  including the director. The only thing this movie has in common with the original is the name. It's a complete mess  bad script  everything.Movies should be like sports. When you do something stupid  you should be fined or something. Everyone involved in this waste of film should be fined and suspended.\tTo all fans of the Crow series  this is by far the worst of the Crow films. Although an interesting concept with the open possibilities for so much  this movie falls completely flat. Horrible dialogue  lousy action sequences  and probably one of the worst casting jobs I've ever seen in a movie.David Boreanaz's performance was a little too far over the top  and comes off almost laughable. For fans of Boreanaz's performance in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel series  most should be extremely disappointed by this role. Dennis Hopper's role in the film was just plain annoying  and even Tara Reid's sex appeal couldn't help this movie.Truthfully  I will say that Edward Furlong's performance might be the only thing that is worth watching in the film. Although his portrayal of the character was different from any other from the Crow series  Furlong captured the essence of the crow films.With such a large cult following for the series  I believe that many will see the film simply because it is a Crow film. Even for all the die-hard Crow fans  I suggest that this one be rented before you buy.\tI just recently bought the DVD and was kind of disappointed. I thought that Edward Furlong did a GREAT job as the crow  he looked great and was just perfect. I thought his acting was good as well. I thought he needed to be in the movie more  he wasn't shown as much as he should have been. My main problem was that Tara Reid and Macy Gray were in the movie  that totally ruined it for me. I HATE Tara Reid  she's a terrible actress and Macy Gray shouldn't be allowed to do anything. David Boreanaz actually surprised me  I thought he did a great job as well  the chemistry between him and Tara Reid sucked though. I liked the movie though  because I have a soft-spot for all of the crow movies. I enjoyed it for the most part  but I still think that Brandon Lee was THE CROW  and that's all I'll say.\tThe Crow Wicked Prayer is a very different movie than the other three. Personally  since I heard that this movie was a prequel  I thought it was gonna be more closer to the first two and that Salvation would be a totally different Crow movie. I was wrong; The Crow Salvation is probably even closer to the original two movies than The Crow Wicked Prayer.I watched it once  and I am going to finally buy it. Surprisingly enough  this movie had quite a bit of originality with the whole fact it deals more with the after life and deals with not just life and death  but Heaven And Hell. Highly unfortunate  David Boreanaz and Tara Reid were quite disappointing. I don't really like David Boreanaz that much  and I STRONGLY hated his performance in it. Edward Furlong made an AWESOME Crow in my opinion  even though he did need to lose a little bit of weight as Jimmy  but the blackness made him look more built. Emmanuel Chriqui was absolutely beautiful in this movie and her performance was pretty decent. As for the secondary characters; eh  who cares about them. Not a whole lot to say about Danny Trejo; he makes a better native than he does a Spanish dude in all his other movies.The only real let downs are the acting and some of the cast. More of an Amateur cast than anything.I REALLY like this movie but I am not going to recommend this movie to people because its more of a movie you watch on your own risk.\tI just bought this film today to go along with the other two Crow movies I own. I was skeptical at first  but aside from the obvious over-use of the lines used in the other films \""To make things right\"" etc.  and the hokeyness of how those words were put into the film  I would say overall the film ranked a good 8 out of 10 in my book.The Crow: City of Angels  in my opinion was worse than Wicked Prayer in my opinion  but I still have a love for them all.I read one reviewers statement here about not having the funds for makeup. But if you will notice  in each film the visual transformation into The Crow and it's methods of face-painting differ from one another. Makeup in the Brandon Lee classic  Fingerpaint in COA  and whatever was used in WP. And the designs on each of the faces were different as well. In fact each movie is different from the other  with a common thread  but different story line.If anyone rents or buys this DVD be sure to look at the making of the film and all the \""extras\"" before watching the film to get a good idea of what the director  crew  and actors were thinking while making this movie.Oddly  this series of films rate far better with me than re-makes we are getting of classic television shows and films of the past. The Crow series contains a universal message  and although it is a series film  is not a re-make of a film from yesteryear which I loathe.Look at it this way  if WP was just a remake of the Brandon Lee classic Crow film  no one would watch it. The directors wanted to make WP different from the others in the Crow series  and I believe  and feel  they accomplished their goal. Sure it has a couple hokey moments  but I only deduct 2 points in my rating scheme from making this one a classic. Not bad...not bad at all.\tI personally have never seen the other crow movies but I highly recommend this movie. I thought it was truly amazing.The transformation. Wow. Teaches to really look deep inside someone. Easy to follow for anyone above like 13+. Putting into consideration whether you pay attention or not. Some graphic scenes. Like one or two sex scenes.The first part of the movie I found a little boring but after the first 10 minutes it forms into something really worth watching. This movie made me want to see the other Crow movies. This movie had a certain sort of creativity. Good story line. Also I liked the music. One of the songs was done by the one of the film makers wives.\tThis is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Had it not been for Ed Furlong of Terminator fame  this would have been impossible to sit through. The acting was thin and the script just too awful to mention. There was a lack of cohesion right from the start. The writers obviously had said everything that they wanted to say in about 10 minutes and the rest was a time filler. The special effects department were a little short of money  so was unbelievably cheesy. I hoped that there might have been some interesting moments once Ed put on the crow makeup  but no. He soldiered on to make the best of a bad situation thankfully. I'm struggling to think of one good thing to say about this film but really the only thing I can come up with is my recommendation which is this:- Please DON\""T BOTHER. Find something serious  or funny  or maybe even corny  just don't get this one.....it's bad. This was a waste of money.\tIn the year 1993  Brandon Lee created a very memorable  dark & beautiful character: The Crow. The movie  with an exceptional script  smart direction  excellent photography and a brilliant cast  it truly one of my all time favorites. Everything from the look of the film  the characters (especially Lee as the Crow)  the phenomenal soundtrack and the overall story of love being stronger than death - I was hooked! I love that film! I saw it in theaters no less than 8 times.CITY OF ANGELS was a shallow  bastardized attempt to cash in on the success of the first film. In some ways  ANGELS almost ripped-off the original  but in a way that makes me loathe the film. Very disappointing! SALVATION  the third in the series was...I can't even remember. I saw it once  and do not remember being overwhelmed by it or feeling anything for it.And now  2005 brings back the return of The Crow with WICKED PRAYER. Unlike the first three films  this one takes place in the desert  near an Indian reservation. I must admit  I was impressed with the cinematography on this film. The desert scenes  the flashback scenes  all were well done and looked great.So...what do I think of the film? The direction? The acting? For starters the direction of this film was all too often sloppy. It appeared  more times than not  the film was confused with where it wanted to go. The characters seemed stuck into scenes  with little to no direction  and carried scenes with no skill. Each set up seemed and felt under-rehearsed and underdeveloped.Edward Furlong is by NO stretch of my imagination an acceptable Crow! Looking too much like a gay goth groupie  instead of a vengeful angel set to make the wrong things right. His costume appeared to steal too much from the original. I felt his performance was bland and tasteless. There was no emotion displayed by his character. I did not feel pity or sorry for him  or what happens to him. I was no convinced that his love was so undying that he could be brought back from the dead. He is no Brandon Lee! I mean  come on: \""Quoth the Raven  Nevermore. Motherf**ker!\"" What kind of crap writing is that? Boreanez is wasted in this film. Though  he has not impressed me much with previous roles such as Adam Carr in VALENTINE  I still feel he is a solid actor and really can pull off the bad guy look. However  in WICKED PRAYER  it never feels like we are 100% sure of what he is doing or why. OK  I get that he is performing a ritual to become a demon or devil  but where did this come from? What is in motivation? World domination? I don't think we will ever know.Tara Reid....Ugh! And Macy Gray?!?!? And what was up with Dennis Hopper  in what could only be his worst performance.None of the cast is able to save this mess! Very upsetting to see the series continue to be treated this way. What started out 12 years ago with such an inspiring beginning  is continuing to fall further down the spiral of sequel Hell!\tThe first crow had flaws and a bit of cheese strewn about but is a classic-it had Brandon Lee and the right mood.The second-just an attempt at cashing in on sequel dollars  just sucked-but had a good cinematographer.the third....didn't know about.the forth I see at the video store-I see tara reid  jason whowever  and think they are probably smart enough to not ruin there beginning careers by doing a movie that sucked. there industry smart right? ed furlong worried me-I thought maybe they would be able to carry him?This film is so bad that I feel embarrassed for the cast  director  and especially James O'barr. They cast and director should be beaten with bats-driven to Mexico in the trunk of a car-and left for dead near a pack of hungry dogs.My neighbor's ten-year-old son could could have made a better film.Whoever wrote the screenplay should be dragged naked over a field of broken glass and then thrown into salt-water filled drum.During a fightsceen where you hear screams of panic in some gymnasium there is this chick (an extra) seen over eddie's shoulder with a drink in her hand staring at the the back of his head with a stupid look on her face-Mind you  the rest of the crowd runs-screaming for fear of being killed-she just stands there.......she is probably just in disbelief that the actors are delivering cheesy lines with the conviction of a crack whore saying that she'll quit after one more rock.There is not one moment of this film that doesn't make me cringe.for those of you who praise this film and say that worth watching.....The hospital should pull your feeding tubes because you have been proved to be brain-dead; there sadly  is no hope for you.think about it! If the producers thought this film was good enough to market it would have been released in theaters.How many flops get great advertising? A WHOLE BUNCH DO-C'mon  \""Baby Genuises\"" got TV ads and was released in theaters. This film went STRAIGHT TO VIDEO--no not because it was indi-because it was awful.\they this movie was a little slow to get started and there were parts like el nino who could have been played a little better.. but the story line was good ed furlong made an excellent crow.. reminded me of brandon lee.. a lot.. this movie also gets my approval over the crow 2 and the crow 3 nothing as of yet beats the crow 1 .. it was original.. the crow series messed up though in part 2 when sarah died.. they should have rolled a sequel off it.. but you know how that goes.. anyway watch this flick its tight... and make sure to look for \""raven\"" eternal pain.. coming soon from the minds of \""shatterbox comics\"" you'll like the comic trust me!\tSince the original Crow movie I was a fan of the concept and story of love after death and the bitter sweet taste of revenge. Brandon Lee was amazing in the original and made the movie legendary.The Crow: City of Angels was sub par at best. The Crow: Salvation showed some hope for line of films. However Wicked Prayer brought it all crashing down to the way I felt after the first.\""They should have stopped there\"" Having read the book I was looking forward to the new setting and how they would rework the urban feel of the film which worked for a bit  however horrible acting  poor dialog and death scenes that wouldn't strike fear into the heart of a 6 year old. Edward Furlong as the crow was just sad  Tara Reid who can usually put out a decent performance was horrible and Dennis Hopper....how the mighty have fallen. David Boreanaz (although at times over the time) made the movie amusing  although whenever he unleashes an Angelous like performance it tends to bring out the best in him.Watching someone be taken out by a fly zapper was laughable.If you have NOTHING better to do and are a fan of the franchise  go for it  so you can at least say you've seen all of them. If you don't want to have the memory of what Brandon Lee did tarnished any more then it already has been  keep walking past the movie and don't look back."""
The Day After Tomorrow (2004),"I am not sure if I should put my input yet  because I saw about 90% of the movie but from what I did see it was great. I was very impressed. This film had realistic graphics and intense moments where I felt like there was no other way out  and the drive that was obvious in Quaid's character to reach his son was strong. The Day After Tomorrow made me think about our instincts. It is so true that only the strong survive. When a challenge (if you can call the next Ice Age a challenge.....) is in front of us..who will make it out alive?...Survival of the fitness......but anyway....Great movie  I recommend completely. A movie you can get lost in.....Brrrrrrrrr........it's cold in here....hand me a sweater will you?....\tThis movie was so bad i had to skip through sections to finish. First there is this elitist scientist  and his son  who come off as arrogant and annoying. Well aside from the first ten minutes which could not happen. Plus numerous uses oft elephones  cell phones and pay phones either underwater  or no power.Its just ridiculous. Plus the photoshopped weather pictures. There are hurricanes shown but only in red. The entire storm is shown to have extreme rainfall  yet its record cold ?? Cold air cant hold water. Either way aside from numerous things in this movie that could never happen  the annoying characters  and the over all repetitive political undertones. I would not ever recommend this movie. Unless maybe its on TV and there is nothing else to do. Not a classic\tThis crap could only spring from a story written by the scare monger and late night On-Air radio moron  Art Bell.Special effects are mildly acceptable  but the story is absolute CRAP (please substitute a stronger term of your choice). The preponderance of pseudo science is gut wrenching. Gee... we humans are ruining our environment and wasting all it's resources. We - not volcanoes or natural cyclic weather patterns - are the sole cause of global warming! Therefore  the entire United States is locked in an instant deep freeze! Global Warming = Instant Freeze? (see what I mean?) The \moral\"" of this insipid story is that  because of our \""misuse\"" of our environment and resources  we must sit in the dark and freeze - or suffer the \""consequences\"". Of course  we would have to keep our radios on in order to listen to Lame-Night AM with the noisy moron  Art Smell.Another commenter suggested that we dispel our higher thinking processes and watch the pretty pictures... believe me  it's not worth it. And  if you have an IQ greater than 45  you can't do it. Too much crap. Nothing is believable  which is also true for Bell's pathetic radio shows. DO NOT WATCH THIS!!! You will puke.\tI watched this movie and was speechless. Clich\u00e9 and one-dimensional characters pop in and out of their scenes in this disconnected mess. It's as if the director/writer made the movie by deciding to paste together every clich\u00e9 from disaster and action movies ... and then thought that by pasting these things together everything would be OK. Things happen to people but  because no character and relationship development has occurred  you not only don't care but you wonder if your brain zoned out and missed entire pieces of the story.There are so many worn-out characters  borrowed from so many formula movies. We have the smart scientist in the antarctic who gives the standard selfless and 'save mankind' speech. There's the main scientist guy who tries to warn the politicians and  of course  has not paid attention to his son and the disaster now proves his mettle. We have the standard low-caste society guy (homeless dude) who teaches people when the disaster comes (and the standard message that we can find out what's really important and how equal we are when normal society structure is uprooted). There's the policeman who recites these horribly canned lines and takes the authority  etc. etc.Now  I can take clich\u00e9. I can even take canned lines. But in each of these characters  there's almost no development - the father ludicrously decides to trek to his son who's in NYC ... and what should be a moving moment because of the father's failures in the past becomes nothing because the failures and introspection of the father hasn't occurred. Scene after scene occurs like this -- the director wants to have these emotionally-charged scenes where you're affected but  because there's no foundation  you don't care.And ... if the tired clich\u00e9s weren't enough  we get illogic at every step. I can go with a movie and accept things that even bend reality but once the movie asks you to go with it  it also then play within the physical rules. The cold acting as if it were the blob in form of ice chasing them was ridiculous. The bureaucracy thing w/ the scientist trying to get the message out was so silly that I kept shaking my head. The dialog of some of the characters during the disaster made me realize that the writer wanted to get things across but failed to realize that it wasn't in sync with the context.I'll stop here. A horrible waste of time.\tMy wife and I kept saying.\"" Sam  go to the boat\"" Maybe that's because anyone but the scriptwriter knows that a ship outfitted for the North Atlantic would be exceptionally outfitted for the type of weather portrayed. Couple thousand gallons of fuel oil  generators  a kick-ass communications system  not to mention the infirmary they actually found. Wonder where the wolves came from? Few things more annoying than sci-fi written by someone who knows jack about \""sci\"". This guy not only knows nothing about \""sci\"" but even the rudimentary funtionong of everyday items; cars  boats  libraries  men  women  hospitals. Entertaining special effects but if it was intended as a cautionary tale not sure what the caution could have been except  \"" Beware of really dumb screenwriters.\""\tA truly horrific experience. \""The Day After Tomorrow\"" heralds from the pop-culture school of action-adventure  where the world is threatened again and again by a splashy screen saver.Things start out  as these films do  with a guilty father. This particular father is guilty because he doesn't spend a lot of time with his son. Don't hang too much on this though  because the movie doesn't. You can substitute basically any reason for a father to feel guilty in any Hollywood picture released in the past 15 years without consequence.It turns out that the guilty father is a scientist. Not just any scientist  but a brilliant scientist. So brilliant he's one of the only people on the planet to predict an approaching global super storm. But no one will believe him  especially--are you ready for this--a vice president who happens to look *exactly* like Dick Cheney. Not-Dick-Cheney says it would be too costly to fight global warming. This is what is called \""dramatic irony \"" when the audience know something the character's don't. In this case  we know that production company spent hundreds of millions of dollars on CGI effects  but not-Dick-Cheney is in the dark.Meanwhile the guilt-causing-son travels to New York for no reason other than the directors intend to destroy it. Several obligatory characters are introduced here  including the going-to-be-girlfriend-shortly-after-major-cataclysmic-event.This is about when the screen saver turns on. Los Angeles and Tokyo are destroyed. The process of Hollywood elimination leaves only New York  which receives its comeuppance in the form of a stealth tidal wave.Leaving the science behind how a 40+ foot tidal wave invades New York and camps there for 11 days aside  let us consider that the New York metropolitan area has more people per square mile than any city in the U.S  or close to it. As a result you might expect people to leave behind bodies when the city fills with forty feet of water. But nature has a surprise for us: this is the world's first acidic tidal wave  dissolving every dead body it comes in contact with. It is followed shortly after by acidic snow.So everything gets cold--real cold  but  like vampires  it can't come in unless you invite it. Somewhere in here as well we have the lamest attempt to add drama in a major motion picture for 2004  when some CGI wolves show up to much the guilt-causing son. There's also some bit about the guilty father trudging through the snow to reach his son in New York. His motivation: he's guilty and he \""has to do this.\"" Eventually it all ends. Guilty dad shows up not five minutes before rescue helicopters do  making his entire journey less than pointless. I guess it was about \""proving yourself.\"" We're assured that everything is okay because even though 2 billion people are dead  the guilty-father and his family made it through  the son got himself a girlfriend  and there are no more screen savers in the budget.In all of this  I left out the smarmy subplots about a kid with cancer and an ultra corny series  probably paid for by the White House  in which the president is the last person to evacuate the danger zone. It's funny stuff  and a good shot in the arm for anyone who believes the \""liberal Hollywood\"" mantra last seen screeching from Ann Coulter's lips.In total  this movie is terrible. Even for a disaster film. Watch it for the screen savers  avoid if you're looking for a credible plot  realistic dialog  or inspired acting.3/10\tI really liked the effects  but the science and human side were simply awful. Really  high school (or grade school) sciences would show the plot simply isn't plausible. However  if I was ever trapped in a library  I would burn the furniture and cabinets long before the books. Abysmal movie  simply stupid actually  but not bad acting.I liked Dennis Quaid.Jake G. is fine as the upset son  though he doesn't have to be particularly brilliant to fulfill his roll.The tsunami in New York is strange since they are caused by non-climactic conditions. And environmentnalism won't prevent what the earth does (at least in this scope).sorry for the let downg\tAside from the poor science  writing  acting  plot  etc.  the single most baffling thing in this piece of trash was the burning of books. If you're in a metal box surrounded by books fine burn 'em. But there was furniture and fixtures and doors that would burn much better then books. They would burn hotter  longer  and more efficiently then books. So anyways watch this crap if you want to see some nasty fake storms. That's about all this film has to offer. On a side note though  seeing a fake Cheney having nature slap him in the face with devastation was nice. And the fake Bush being so insecure and weak willed that he couldn't make a decision without his VP explicitly instructing him on the \""correct\"" course made me giggle.\tI find it hard to believe that anyone enjoyed this movie for anything other than the fact that it is possibly the most unintentionally funny movie of 2004.The effects are unrealistic  the acting is unrealistic  the writing is unbelievably horrific. The people who made this movie should never be allowed to work in the entertainment industry again  or at the very least should be sentenced to cleaning the bathrooms at AMC for the rest of their lives.People wonder why the movie industry is suffering  well it may just be due to the fact that nobody in their right mind is going to pay $12 to watch this crap.HBO please stop running this train wreck 15 times a day.\tAs the saying goes: there's no accounting for taste. So  I strongly disagree with the negative review featured on this movie's info page. One should note  however  that the reviewer  \""Libertio \"" gives high praise to several of the visual effects and calls the satirical scenes \""potent.\"" I think Libertio misses the point when he criticizes the story which I found plausible and of more than ordinary interest  particularly for a disaster movie. Please be aware that my \""10\"" rating is based on a comparison with other movies of this type; it is not absolute.Furthermore  I think movie ratings should be \""conditional\"" rather than absolute. Isn't it unfair to compare  say  \""Something About Mary\"" with \""Schindler's List?\"" Along these lines I would ask Libertio what other action/disaster movies does he consider superior to \""Tomorrow?\"" As for myself  I found the effects chilling (pun intended)  surprising  and awe inspiring. The scientific thesis underlying the story may be unlikely or even false as some scientists have stated  but the vast majority of scientists in the field do think that the earth is undergoing a warming period and that humans are contributing to this phenomenon.So  the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it story this movie postulates does reverberate in the popular mind. May I suggest that the plot may be a bit too plausible to be really enjoyed by the popular mind? Otherwise  I  for one  find it difficult to account for the overall lowish rating given in IMDb's survey.\tWhile the special effects in the first part of the movie were well done  the plot and dialog were some of the most ridiculous I have ever watched. I often thought that a 12 year-old had written the screenplay.Fortunately  I watched the movie for free on TV while on vacation in NYC so I didn't waste any money on this idiot-fest.It is a mystery to me how movies this poorly written ever get made in the first place.One of the things I was planning to do when I retire is to take a screen writing class and mostly for the fun of it write an original screenplay and semi-seriously try and market it. After watching \""The Day After Tomorrow\""  I feel very encouraged at the possibility that I might actually be successful!\tI was disappointed when I saw this film. I usually enjoy apocalyptic and natural disaster films (Armageddon excepted) but this was poor. I remember better artificial film graphics from the early 90s. Everything in this film seemed artificial  the characters  the storyline  the events and the authenticity of the film-makers premise. There was no moral proposition to the serious issue of Global warming. I hated that millions died and the world was in total chaos and the whole film was centered around a bunch of imbeciles!I would not recommend this film. A big budget film on a huge issue which effects everyone in the world should not have been like this.\tI've read varying comments about this film ranging from excellent to downright vomit inducing. I've read one comment where someone said that if you actually liked this film  you obviously don't care for quality films. I'd argue to the contrary.In the beginning we witness a variety of freak weather anomalies ranging from snowstorms in India  hailstorms in China and massive tornadoes in California. By the end  we find the world undergoing a new ice age. A little rash? Of course.But what those who think enjoying this film means we don't care  how about understanding some of us simply enjoy cheesy disaster films. I like an excellent  though provoking flick as much as the next person but sometimes  watching something so overly dramatic and impossible in real life provides that escape that we need.I personally loved this film. Through decent acting  a love story brought on by fear of rejection and trying to triumph against all odds and the fight for survival bring about a human element much needed into today's story lines. It doesn't need to be real. Why make movies seem real? Where's the point? Day After Tomorrow in all it's world destroying glory is entertainment. Nothing more...nothing less. And besides  watching New York get devastated by flood  snow and ice is kind of cool. Same with L.A. It's interesting to see two often overrated big cities get slammed to ruins.I'd recommend this to my friends. Real or not  clich\u00e9d or not  cheesy or not  this is a good thriller worthy of considering.\tThis Movie was not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. In fact I even sort of enjoyed it. It starts of pretty weak  apparently Dennis Quaid is the only person in the world to be able to predict a huge storm that is going to change the climate and the world forever. What caused such a storm  pollution. Of course the US government ignores him  wouldn't you  and terror ensues. This movie is basically a run of the mill natural disaster movie with with descent special effects. Nothing all that special  but if you enjoy natural disaster flicks you will probably like this one. The movie would have been way better had Donnie Darko and Dennis Quaid had died at the very beginning and the homeless man was trapped in with a bunch of supermodels. However  it did not happen that way and there is only an OK and not great movie.\tThis movie appears a lot more realistic after the December Tsunami and the Mumbai floods. Yes  it has been over-dramatized to an extent  but they needed to make a movie out of it. All the masala ingredients are in it  father-son relationship  little bit romance  edge of the seat excitement  great special effects...really makes you think of the power of nature! The Manhattan  Statue of Libery shots have been done quite well. Scientific details inserted at appropriate junctures - to prevent a documentary feel to it. This movie also touches upon the shift in power  the level playing field that the world is heading to...Definitely worth a see!\tGood storytelling. However  I wouldn't call it a good movie. I also wouldn't call The Day After Tomorrow a bad movie. It falls somewhere in the middle. It's classic Enviro-Nazi propaganda. Yes  Earth's climate is fragile. So is the economy. Everything's interconnected. If you make claims about the environment  you have to back them up scientifically. It's like the boy who cried wolf. When the wolf does come and eats the sheep  nobody will listen. We need more information. We don't have it. But you have to consider the source here  and that's scientists  looking for government grants  who brought us just the opposite back in the '70s. What's the opposite of global warming? Global cooling of course. When I was in junior high and high school back in the '70s  you couldn't turn on the news  radio or television  without hearing about global cooling  and how we were heading for the next ice age. The events in the movie are too preposterous to be real. It was done for dramatic effect.. The redeeming feature of the movie was the special effects.\tI figured that this would be primarily a special-effects movie  so I didn't have high expectations. Unfortunately  those expectations weren't met. I had hoped that solid acting by Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal could make this a character-driven action movie. The writing and direction removed any hope of that.When watching the movie  I was surprised to find that the acting of Quaid and Gyllenhaal was quite bad. Since I hold these actors in high regard  I blame the script. It quickly digressed into unimaginably simplistic melodrama. Perhaps the actors had as much problem believing the dialog as I did. For crying out loud  they even threw in a kid with cancer as a whorish attempt to generate some emotion  although it added nothing to the plot.The special effects were exceptional. If that is sufficient for you to enjoy a movie  this is a movie for you. If you require good character development and a creative script as I do  then this movie is likely to fall well short.\tWhen you talk about catastrophe movies  the catastrophe has to be something that is plausible  otherwise the catastrophe becomes a joke. This is the case in this movie. This movie suggests a scenario that is so preposterous  even for a science fiction movie  that it reduces the movie to the level of a farce. When the entire northern hemisphere freezes in a few hours and a freighter winds up in the middle of Manhattan  the movie takes a turn that makes it fundamentally ridiculous. And to watch characters trudging through a blizzard reminded me of Dr. Zhivago trudging his way back to Lara  except in Zhivago's case there was actually a plausible story with which to associate Zhivago's actions. This is not to say that I did not find the special effects intriguing because I did  but special effects themselves are not enough to sustain a movie  which this movie proves. If you like cold weather this is the movie for you.\tI looked forward to the movie as a sort of super disaster movie. The science of it looked hokey even in the previews. Watching the movie it continued to seriously decline. The acting was mostly so so with Dennis Quaid seeming a bit too stereotyped.The movie starts out with Jack Hall a climatologist preaching the evils of global warming to a delegation and insulting the VP of the US. All through the movie I thought I should be at the church of Green Peace instead of watching a movie. After the initial sermon was delivered we were propelled quickly into fairly well done natural disasters which tended to have no real basis in the movie except to slip in death and destruction. If it were meant to show a sample of the climate change it focused only on the \""evil\"" industrial nations and ignored the likely more severe effects non-industrial nations would suffer.Then comes the storms. One of which leaves New York heavily flooded leaving Jack Hall's son and companions stranded in a NY City library. Their fight for survival is trivialized and social dynamics completely ignored. I never felt sympathy for the stranded nor did the preaching end at any time. Every scene had subtle political and social jibes. Few with any factual basis. Jack Hall soon as he is proved right by the disasters that only he predicted soon takes off on an epic journey  or what would be an epic journey that turns into a boring stroll to rescue his son.For a film that purportedly espouses environmental issues wolves are poorly portrayed in this film. So not only does the film do disservice to environmentalists with poor science it is an absolute insult to those who know wolf behavior. A polar bear would have been much more exciting and realistic as the danger to the stranded scholars (Jack Hall's son and companions).To cut a long and boring narrative short there are cut overs to Mexico blanketed in snow warmly accepting a billion or more US residents after initially closing the border. Lets see. Paniced refugees. A major countries Government evacuating an entire nation to Mexic. War would be a logical result. Mexico would not have the resources to support so many refugees. Where did Canada's population go or was Canada completely wiped out? What about nations in the South. The movie seemed to think only the Northern Hemisphere would be affected.I found this movie to be a grown up fairy tale for lip service environmentalists. There were some special effects that were cool. Other than that no real reason to see this movie unless you are extremely bored.\tSure  \""The Day After Tomorrow\"" is entertaining enough to watch but as a movie it isn't really a good one. The characters are flat and hollow and the story lacks substance and a well build up ending. Also they manage once more to put in some clich\u00e9 disaster movie moments and over-dramatized and unlikely moments.I'm sure director Roland Emmerich also tried to make a political statement with this movie but he fails terribly with all of his attempts in this movie. In the movie the American government seems more concerned with their budget than the global environment and express this arrogantly openly in public. Well not even in real life the American government is THAT arrogant as portrayed in this movie. All those scene's were Emmerich tries to make a political statement are rather laughable and unlikely than anything else really.Yes  sure the movie has some nice and cool looking special effects with lots of stuff getting crushed  demolished and blown away ala Emmerich's other movie  \""Independence Day\"" but thats about the only good and positive thing that can be said about this movie. The story itself is quite ridicules and unlikely and doesn't feel realistic enough because everything is over-dramatized so much  just like in disaster movies from the '70's was always the case. The movie is filled with some pointless action (the wolves attack) and pointless characters (the English always tea-drinking Ian Holm character and friends for instance)Having a story-line focusing on a group of young student children is always risky  since most of the time they are always portrayed by annoying and bad actors. This however is not the case in this movie. Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum are splendid actors and they manage to portray some likable characters.This movie is fairly watchable as entertainment but it still is not a movie that I would recommend to everyone.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"""
The Descent (2005),"I saw the trailer for this a while back and immediately thought it looked rubbish. Another by the numbers horror film following the usual rules and ultimately leading to the usual  drab  gore-fest. How wrong I was! Off the back of a Mark Kermode review in The Observer I thought I would give it a crack - particularly as my girlfriend's a horror fan and I needed to redeem the genre after suffering her making me watch Creep. The plot is basic and borrows from numerous other horror films. Group of friends \with issues\"" get trapped in dark place with nasty things there out to get them. However  the way the material is realised on screen keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat  jumping repeatedly  however telegraphed the scares are  and cringing away from the fairly gruesome gore. One scene in particular when the group use the infra red setting on a camcorder to check everyone is OK had the entire cinema (including myself) screaming - an experience completely new to me and a real pleasure to endure. The pace is very cleverly set  with a slow  but never boring  build up of menace as the women's situation plummets from bad to downright hellish  before exploding in a finale that will leave you scared  breathless and absolutely terrified of the dark. I have never ever had the desire to go potholing  but now would probably go so far as to sit through Hollow Man  Vertical Limit AND Weekend at Bernie's II before venturing below the earth's crust into a dark hole. Go and see it... please! I was really pleasantly surprised and have been telling everyone I know to go and see it whereas normally by attachment to a movie ends when I leave the cinema. What's more  Alex Reid  who plays Beth  is from my home county of Cornwall - wahay!!!\tJust caught this one and I'm still reeling a bit. I really didn't expect very much of it at all  and was a bit concerned about the idea of Neil Marshall playing it straight. Part of the reason why Dog Soldiers worked so well was it's very English sense of humour  and without that I thought The Descent would flounder. Turns out I was very wrong indeed.Where the film succeeds most is simply by scaring the bejezus out of you. The whole cinema was wincing and shrieking along with the cast members  and there is an emotional depth that I'm surprised hasn't been made more of. Okay  so the cast are a little too photogenic for their own good  but then I suppose this is the movies. I don't think we'd care quite so much if Anne Widdecome got stuck in a cave.I suppose the only potential minus point (largest selling point if you wear black  listen to nu metal and manage to combine a comfortable middle class background with like  so totally hating yourself)is the degree of bone crunching violence (literally). There is a great deal of blood. But... the film was quite restrained for the genre in that 1. Everyone stayed pretty much fully clothed for the entire movie 2. There was none of this psychological/ physical torture crap that everyone seems to feel obliged to put in anything even vaguely horror related these days (Takashi Miike  be very ashamed. Only kidding  love you really! Just from a distance. A very long distance). Okay  so one or two people got eaten  but the bad guys weren't doing it for kicks  they were hungry. For some reason that doesn't sit so badly with me. There. High horse dismounted.Anyway... at the risk of rambling. Rather a pleasant surprise. Just go watch before they remake it  Hollywood style. The Descent is just the kind of film they'd bugger up royally given half a chance and a $40 million cheque. Which is why it's so nice to see we can make it instead.\tA film about menstruation based on the Freudian model in which girls a plenty confront bloody vampriric monsters in a cavernous hell. You can say its about bereavement  you can say its about repressed Lesbian relationships  though you'd be wrong there; you could even say its about nothing but I say you're wrong - its one long bit of anxiety about the female cycle and I DON'T mean the one your girlfriend bought from Halfords this morning. In terms of imagery its everywhere - wild and deadly fluctuations in mood against a backdrop of blood drenched passages. Everyone knows the definitive take on the subject is The Blob but this is a close second. Saturated in horrid  ovulating imagery its a pion to the desires of the flesh - those feelings that build to a bloody crescendo at a certain time. The final third is resplendent with multitudinous acts of penetration - a symbolic acknowledgement of the contradictory desire to be impregnated at a time when its the most dangerous. I found it to be a gruelling  unpleasant experience as a result because lets be honest  no-one wants to get into that sort of thing do they?\tAbsolutely breathtaking. Try not to find anything out about the plot it'll ruin it for you  just go and see it. Don't download it  it'll be not be half as good on a small screen  get yourself to the cinema and prepare for a two hour roller coaster ride.This film is a masterclass in horror  within the first ten minutes you'll have gasped for breath and jumped out of your skin. Then following this for the next hour or so the director creates a feeling of claustrophobia and an overwhelming sense of foreboding  priming your body  putting you just on edge enough to react with terror when the action happens.And happen it does  your treated to fright after fright  thick and fast until the ending (which is actually good). Once the credits roll you won't want to move  just sit for a while getting your breath back. And then go watch it again.\tSadly I think I was built up to think this was going to be a good  scary  creepy film. Unfortunately it was none of the above. Whilst I wouldn't go so far as to call it a bad film I can't bring myself to say it was good either.It certainly has some good moments  but sadly it has a lot of dull moments as well  some people will prefer the pace of the first half of the movie  others like me will prefer it when it picks up a bit in the second half.I think one problem was having too many characters  none of which we really get to know and therefore care about  I found it hard to care about the fate of these complete strangers. This is particularly odd as  like I mention above  the first half of the movie is very slow moving and should have been used as a chance to really get to know the characters. But to be honest I couldn't tell one character from another throughout the movie. I would have liked the movie better maybe if they had given us 3 or 4 characters and built them up with individual personalities  it seemed to be like they were only 2 different personalities out of all the characters.The second problem is  well quite frankly it's not scary  not necessarily a major problem for some movies but for a movie that had a small budget  not exactly great acting and a one sentence plot outline  it was obviously relying on being scary to get by. And thats where it falls down  yes there are a few scattered jump moments  but most of them are fake moments if you like. (sort of like the old classic  hear a noise then a cat jumps out type moments) When it actually came to the crunch the bits that should have been scary simply weren't.Rent this when it comes out if you like potholing  or are looking for a non-scary thriller  but if you are looking for a decent thriller or horror I wouldn't bother.\tA beautifully made film is always nice to see in my eyes. This is one of them. You don't get many and after seeing the \""Boogeyman\""  this  THE DESCENT is welcomed with open arms.So  I have just returned home from the cinema after watching this fine film. The storyline  characters  location  camera work  everything perfect up until the very end. It crumbles at the last with a ending that  too me could have three different meanings. It does not wreck the film in anyway but it leaves you thinking  what the hell happened then? Watch it and you will see...The Movie has a lot of gore which works so well. Its not too much and it ain't over the top. The Cave added a lot of suspense and terror to the whole movie and you really felt like the Ladies were been hunted. Also  the horror and suspense was created by the Characters. Normally its a loud sound effect or strange noise but in this film  the close ups of the struggling women gave it the edge. Something many horror films never do often enough (Boogeyman). This is top notch survival horror.All in all  the movie is a must see for Genre lovers. The film is excellent from the start adding little scary moments before the crawlers were even shown. Fantastic movie and Marshall must be praised for it! Well done Marshall - from ME!\tI did like the film. I thought it was scary and in-depth and was on the edge of my seat or squeezing my partners hand for a lot of it . I liked it up the the very last 4 or 5 seconds. I liked the fact that we thought she had got out and survived but we find she is still in the cave. Then she starts hallucinating about her daughter again and has a psycho smile on her  like its the end and she knows it but she's with her daughter so its OK. The only thing that struck me as weird was when the camera zoomed out and we saw her in a random alcove in a massive cave face and then there's a random scream. This is all very ambiguous and theatrical. Films are usually finished with a definite question or ending but this felt random and not physically realistic when the rest of the film was. Didn't she fall down a hole to land where she was? How did she get there? It's a small thing to moan about but the ending can make so much difference to a film.\tEven though I was fully prepared for disappointment (I can't really remember the last horror/action film to really deliver on its promises - maybe Aliens?) this film lives up to the hype.Not since the head popped out of the boat in Jaws have I jumped so high. Neil Marshall is a genius - on several occasions  you know 'something' is coming - you know a scare is imminent  but still you jump.The premise is novel even if the set pieces aren't - but that doesn't matter. The film gets you gripped and there is some (not much but enough) depth to actually care for the characters. Making this an all-woman affair was spot-on  it sooo wouldn't have worked with male leads.Neil Marshall states that he would love to do Alien 5 - based on this  he was born for the job.Just goes to show what a Brit can do with a small amount of money  a lust for horror and a feel for what the cinema going  popcorn munching  scare the pants of me public really want to see.\texceptional acting from a bunch of no-hit actors (many of the actors were first timers) but you couldn't tell. The story was smooth and well done. The suspense was excellent and when things got moving...they didn't stop...the movie kept you on the edge of your seat until the very last seconds. Great horror/suspense movie...worthy of watching! I really enjoyed dog soldiers  and this was was better! Mostly shot in caves  the director did a great job with the lighting and used the darkness in a great way. I gave this a 10 since compared to the vast majority of \""horror\"" movies that have come out in the last few years..this one is on top!\tOver the years  like most people  I have seem them all  but  without question  this is the best horror film I have ever seen. I have never witnessed an audience react in the way in which they did when I watched this on the big screen. My girlfriend was physically shaking when we left.Its completely superb from beginning to end and I echo the comments please have made about going to watch this at the cinema  rather than wait for it to come onto DVD. Its quite simply SUPERB and if you like being scared you will love it. I went caving very recently for the first time and appreciated how the dark and very confined spaces can play on your nerves. Films like The Ring  Grudge  and Saw to name a few recentish ones aren't in the same league as this.See it  you will not regret it.\tAs a fan of horror films  and one who's prepare to watch some of the lesser films in the genre  I went to see this not expecting an awful lot. As long as it gave me a few jumps and wasn't too clich\u00e9d  I'd be reasonably happy. I was pleasantly surprised to find instead a very enjoyable film that kept my attention throughout. Although it couldn't be described as a desperately original script  it did avoid some of the clich\u00e9s that have plagued recent films such as Wrong Turn. The women in question at least had a purpose to being in such a perilous situation. Also  Instead of being killed off one-by-one by an single  unseen  lurking menace  they were attacked en mass by a group of creatures who stayed mostly in sight afterwards. The characters were given enough of a background to provide some intrigue  but not so much as to slow the early scenes. But best of all  I enjoyed the way that the ending played with your expectations of horror movies. After a very enjoyable 90 minutes or so  the bog-standard 'one-person-escapes-and-someone-you-thought-was-dead-is-still-alive' ending really made my heart sink. So I was relieved when it cut back to the main character still in the caves  suffering a mental breakdown and facing certain death. It was refreshing to see such a downbeat ending in a low-budget horror film and one that made me think about it long after I left the cinema. Probably the most positive comment I can make about this film is that there was nothing really wrong with it. There were no plot twists or characterisations that felt unnecessary or inconsistent. It set out to create suspense  shock the audience and make them squirm. And that is exactly what it did for me and most of the people in the cinema with me. And for doing its job so well  I've given it 9 out of 10. Sure  it's no Citizen Kane  but it does exactly what it sets out to do. I've yet to see 'Dog Soldiers'  which is by the same director  but definitely will now. If it's as refreshingly un-clich\u00e9d and as well-made as 'The Descent'  then it should be a great night's entertainment.\tAfter all the powerful horror movies Hollywood has brought us in the last few years - whether it be Ring  Grudge or whatever  this has gotta be the worst.OK there are a few scare moments  maybe just one or two  but this film really does get boring after..about 20 minutes. Maybe 25.The worst thing is that  without spoiling anything  the evil that is created to scare us isn't scary at all. And i'm not a person that doesn't get scared in movies either  but Nora-Jane No one's hair is probably the scariest thing in this movie.Invest your money in a better movie.\tThe Director Neil Marshall has done it again  after the excellent Dog Soldiers he has again shown the Americans how to make a great horror film. The Descent is a very clever film  it builds up the tension slowly then unleashes all hell on the viewer. It is a very jumpy film! and has a good storyline that will have you thinking long after you have left the cinema. It is probably the best horror film I have seen since .... well since Dog Soldiers! Marshall seems to have had a bigger budget to work with Descent and he puts it to very good use  the Crawlers are very well done without being too OTT. My one small complaint is although the darkness of the underground caves serves to up the tension in the film it is however hard to follow some of the action. I had a similar complaint about Alien V Predator but this film is far superior to that one. You may think thats not saying much but I think AVP was very harshly treated by the critics  but I do wonder what Marshall could do with an Alien film or a Predator movie. Has Stallone got a director for Rambo IV yet? This man could do the job! Is it better than Dog Soldiers? I'll call it a draw. Roll on the next one  a World War II movie? That would be great.\tNeil Marshall is a supreme talent in horror that should not be ignored  especially by Hollywood who did just that with Dog Soldiers and is repeating it with The Descent  both of which have not had US cinema releases For his second movie he's decided to stay with horror but this time dropping the fun factor and relying on pure horror  scare tactics and something he's proving to excel in  a very strong and realistic script. Something that hit me during the early scenes of the all female climbing group sitting in their cabin chatting  is the realism of their vocabulary and delivery. It's something that was obvious in Dog Soldiers as well and it appears that Marshall has a talent for this. He picks actors who are not widely known but have a knack for a natural style  and then gives them some of the most natural scripted lines I've heard in a long time. It's very refreshing and very obvious  making it stand apart from many other films in and out of this genre.From the outset Marshall tells us in no uncertain terms that there's no fun in this film  this is going to be hard  in your face horror. Oh  and expect the scares to be off tempo and unexpected. No matter how atune you think you are to avoiding jumping  shouting out  or just sitting with a grimace on your face  he'll hit you just about every time in this movie. It's scary and very dark.One of the interesting things about this movie is how dark it is  they used as many realistic light sources as they could through the movie. That means the head torches of the pot holers  flames  torches  etc. Frankly I can't imagine that they got away with realistic lighting throughout  but you certainly have that feel from beginning to end.The whole movie gives you the feeling of enclosed spaces  darkness and the total loss of any bearings. For the most part you realise that the team are going in and deeper  but when trouble begins you loose all sense of direction and depth along with the characters.Once again the creatures in the movie are superb  not over the top like other horror offerings of the same ilk  but grounded in reality. Again Marshall has looked at the creature of the movie and worked out what it would look like and how it would behave based more on science and our real world than folklore and fantasy. What he comes up with is a strangely unnerving creature which isn't as all powerful as other films would have  and is real enough to prey upon your own fears rather than allowing you to distance yourself from it with the comfort of that very word  fantasy.The editing goes a long way to providing us with the shocks and scares on an offbeat tempo. You'll be expecting something  and nothing happens  you'll be expecting nothing  and then the audience screams or leaps. There are more than just scares in the movie though  there are plenty of surprises  twists and quite a few \""oh my god\"" moments  all extremely well crafted  written  edited and directed onto the screen.As for the talent of the female cast  there's not much to fault them. They are all so believable in their terror and confusion  but particular attention should be paid to MyAnna Buring as the lead  Sam  who takes you on a fantastic change of character  as does Natalie Jackson Mendoza. There's also the super sexy Alex Reid who has some fantastic lines early on in the movie. Nora-Jane No one also gives a superb and agonising performance during a few scenes where gasps and groans were echoing through the audience - that Marshall is a nasty man.What I really like about this movie is the reality of it all  okay there are some belief suspension moments  but we're not talking parasitic worms that grow into forty foot winged beasts  we're talking something that isn't that far from what could actually occur. Then there's the characters themselves who speak and behave as you think you just might too  and it's that part that really grabs me into Marshall's movies. He's got a realistic script combined with actors who deliver realistic performances. With these positives in the movie you're hooked  pulled in  and there's nothing to distract you from being thrown around with the movie.The ending is another strong part of the movie  it's also very well conceived  and you'll be sitting watching the credits roll still thinking about the movie  you'll even have walked away and still be thinking about it. You might feel slightly cheated  but I believe that's because we're too used to having everything handed to us on a plate in Hollywood  and this is perhaps why Hollywood hasn't taken either of Marshall's movies as yet  because they don't follow their standard movie template.Looking back on the movie  I'd like it to have had a little bit more - and please excuse the expression - meat on it. Tying something more in with the main character and her state of mind  as well as the opening of the film  and perhaps a tiny little bit more on the ending of the movie would have made it perfect for me. I think it does a superb job in the horror\\scare departments  but there was room for a bit more psychological based subplot  perhaps involving more character interplay.\tDon't waste ya money !!!!!!! Just got back from watching this at Leicester Square (\u00a311.00). I've only fallen asleep during 1 movie  well before today  now I've fallen asleep twice  one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the 25 years I've been alive. I really was annoyed & felt like asking for my money back. The movie is really slow & only seems to have a few minutes of excitement during the whole film  not much of a story either.If ya wanna see a good exciting horror movie I'd advise ya to stay the hell away from this movie. Instead go to B&Q and buy some white paint & watch the paint dry.This is the sort of film that when it comes out on DVD doesn't even deserve to be a drinks coaster.Big thumbs down from me  also my mate thought it was a poor excuse for a movie as well.Don't waste ya money !!!!!!!\tMan  it is so rare I am affected by a movie I see  but this one truly gave me the chills. It gave me an all-around feeling of total and utter claustrophobia and that was even before the main plot of the films takes over.A bunch of female friends challenge themselves to descent into a mountain  very deep and narrow. They crawl through narrow holes they can barely fit into  holes so narrow the only way if forward  there is no turning back......but that is only the \""fun\"" beginning  deeper without the mountain they stumble across something much  much worse.I'm much into horror films but I'm also very critical...this one however kept me in total suspense...I'll give it a 9 of out 10...easy as that!\tI seem to be in the minority here  but I thought this film was a complete disappointment when compared to \""Dog Soldiers\"". Others have given an overview of the plot  which I won't repeat  and the film does have a few spectacular moments.However  I never felt that \""engaged\"" with any of the characters  and as such found it difficult to care that much as the body count grew. Maybe this is partly a bloke thing - since the cast is virtually all women  and character development does not seem to have high on the priority list  I found it difficult to get that concerned with the fate of any particular actor.The special effects are OK  but by now my mind was wondering about all the logical inconsistencies in the plot  and the premise of the situation the actors have to confront.There's also the problem of the set - although I guess the intention was to recreate the claustrophobia of the confines of the caves  in practice I felt that after a while this just gave the film a one-dimensional appearance.Although there are frequent references to other movies during the film  and I guess spotting them all would be vaguely amusing  in order to play that card this would need to be a better film.I was looking forward to seeing it  but it's one of those films in my opinion will soon be buried without trace  which is disappointing.\tthis is one of the most excellent films I have ever seen. I thought Dog Soldiers would be hard for this lad to top  but he has done it.i am relatively sure that if you are reading this comment then you have read others  so i will not go into details of the plot as such. this film seems to be suffering with a really bad distribution run. like Dog Soldiers  it is a hard film to find. a great shame - compared to some rubbish that gets released  it is criminal to keep this one buried.it's quite possibly more violent than any \""video nasty\"" i can recall. the graphic violence is not for the squeamish  and probably not for many who think they can handle the strong stuff.an all-female cast may put some people off  but you should not let it. these are no ordinary ladies  and they are certainly not dumb stupid American ladies either.this and the previously mentioned Dog Soldiers makes for a quality double bill. roll on the next one from the same team!if you are a horror fan  see this film as soon as possible. it will be 90+ minutes that you will never regret.\tI don't personally know the authors of this movie  but they couldn't be my friends  not anymore  not from tonight on  since I've seen this horrifically bad horror. No friends  because I just feel they wanted to tease the spectator  take the mickey out of them.Simply not fair. Yes  of course he who goes see an horror film wishes to be scared; sure as hell he wants. But politely. Intelligently. You simply cannot ground all the horror in scenes with sudden screams and thunders  sudden visions  sudden whatever. I can as well come to you and shout in your ear and probably scare you  if you aren't thinking of me.And this film doesn't just (try to) scare in a stupid way; it's also stupid  too. In the plot  in the characters  in the occasions created to introduce the events. I can understand that some movies just need a very basic plot to introduce amazing and entertaining SFX scenes... but besides some little pale scary monsters  there really was nothing amazingly beautiful to see or follow.\""It's beautiful\""  says one of the cave divers as soon as she reaches the bottom. Perhaps the scene was really beautiful (an hidden cave with a rich vegetation)  but not even once the director chose to show us some of that beauty.Deprived of any beauty  this movie  very bad  is just and plain an ugly movie  which surely shocks you  but not more than a long series of loud bangs and explosions you could hear in your room.\tFrom the maker of Dog Soldiers this film shares a lot of the same characteristics.A group of twenty something women like to live life on the edge. Following from a tragedy after a previous outing they embark on a pot holing expedition. Instead of visiting an easy cave they embark on a trip to an uncharted cave that conveniently has a track to the entrance.For me the film is at its best in the first half that really recreates the (few) joys and (many) pains of pot holing. I tried it several years ago and found it a thoroughly horrible experience. I was therefore squirming at several of the early scenes. Once the cave reveals a few unexpected creatures the film moves into normal territory as the women desperately try to find the open air.If you like your horror films to have lots of blood you'll love this one. It's never dull and well worth a viewing if you ever think about going pot holing."""
The Devil's Rejects (2005),"There are no words to describe how disgusting and offensive this movie was. My bf and I went thinking it was going to be a horror flick. It was border line porn and had no plot what-so-ever. I can't believe they would even give Rob Zombie and the other producers a camera! lol No talent at all!! It is Very offensive and degrading to women. It wasn't even scary  just very disturbing to know people actually create films like this and have no morals. I couldn't believe all of the nudity and sexual content. It is very offensive and unnecessary when making a horror movie. Such a waste of precious time and money!!!! I felt very tainted and disturbed as I kept watching but Needless to say  we proudly walked out of the filth!\tI saw this movie last night  and I was not expecting all that it showed. I saw the previews  but it is nothing like the movie. The film itself has a little bit of \Texas Chainsaw\""  a little \""Clockwork Orange\""  a little \""Last House\""  a tiny bit of \""Silence of the Lambs\"" and a pinch of \""Shining\"". It was mind blowing. It had great cinematography (it almost felt like it was actually from the 1970's)  great music (especially the sequence with \""Free Bird\"")  great direction (better than 1000 Corpses)  great writing and great acting (especially Ken Foree). The movie is more psychologically terrifying than it is \""jump out at ya\"" terrifying like the crap we have today. Zombie is almost like horrors Tarantino  since he takes from all these films and makes a great movie. Right after I saw it  it was A lot to take in. I couldn't even really talk about it  since I was still trying to take it all in. The movie was shocking  gross  funny  vile  twisted... and I loved every minute of it.Also  I must note that at all costs  keep your children away from this movie. I saw a family at the theater. Its not ur normal 21st century horror film. It was almost like imagining some family taking their kids to see \""Clockwork Orange\"" without having a clue what either the book or movie is about.See it  but beware.\tI don't know what else to say...I would have given this movie a zero if I could've. It's a shame cuz I'm a fan of Rob Zombie but this movie was AWFUL...it will probably be some camp classic that my kids will go watch at midnite years from now.Like I referenced in the headline  it was very stylish and glossy and it did have a pretty good soundtrack  the songs were very well placed...but absolutely no substance and no plot. I can't believe I spent 8 bucks and 2 hours of my life watching it. But oh well  you can't win them all.I don't recommend this for kids if you have them and are prone to taking them to R rated movies...there were a couple in the theater...this movie is way too gruesome for them.\tHaving enjoyed House of 1000 Corpses more than any other horror movie I have ever seen I went to see Devil's Rejects with very high expectations from Zombie. I was very disappointed. The use of strong language  which was employed wonderfully in the first film  was over used and eventually completely superfluous to the film itself. And while the violence was as brutal as you would expect from Zombie it seems his imagination ran dry in this second film. You can only be shocked so many times by the sight of a fleshy human mask. Even the characters were not as involving or interesting as they had been in the first film. If it had not been for Sid Haig giving us the Captain Spaulding we came to love from the first movie  it would have been completely worthless. Portions of the film seem to drag on endlessly  especially the scene with the movie expert rattling on and on about the Marx Brothers. I left the theatre feeling almost cheated; the invincible and completely insane characters  which were charming in the first film  had become these motiveless violent foul-mouthed vigilantes that I was loath to watch for two hours. In summation  Rob Zombie took a wonderful cult horror movie and added to it an insidious sequel that is not worth the price of admission. Wait for the DVD  then find a coupon for a free rental is my suggestion.\tAfter watching this movie  you realize how grateful you will be that horror/suspense directors such as zombie exist cause sh*t like the grudge and the exorcist 3 make us forget what true film gore is......... i advise anyone with a love of gore and horror/suspense to go see this movie ..... but leave the kiddies at home. Few parents made the mistake of bringing there kids to this movie where it obviously is NOT by any means meant for children or anyone with a weak stomache ..... this movie kicks A$$ beyond anyone movie I've seen in the theaters since crash ......................... i will go see this movie multiple times just so rob can use my money to hopefully make many more movies ......\tThe Devil's Rejects hit me like a sucker punch. Being a fan of 70s horror in general  I was a big fan of House of 1000 Corpses when it came out. For all the major bashing it took for its campiness  borrowing from other sources  and pseudo-art house aspirations  I found it to be enjoyable  simple horror that didn't take the genre TOO seriously  without being mean spirited. When I sat down in the theater for The Devil's Rejects  I wasn't really prepared for the genius bit of cinema Rob Zombie created. While the touches of camp humor and over the top violence linger  the film itself was beautiful  multi-layered  and unique.While Corpses set up the deranged Firefly family as a stock group of serial killers  straight out of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre  TDR refined the characters  making for a movie that was much more realistic. Sheri Moon drops the annoying cackle this time around  in favor of sly deviousness and frantic bloodlust as Baby. Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding becomes the villain everyone suspected he was in Corpses  while providing most of the movie's comic relief. But it is Bill Mosely who is the true standout as Otis Driftwood. While the Otis of the previous installment is terrifying at times  many of his mannerisms and lines are derivative of Charles Manson  pushing the boundaries from crazy to just plain funny (the lines about \""scooping ice cream for s**theel friends\"" still makes me crack up). This humor is mostly gone from Otis. He is dark  deranged  and murderous  but the love and protection he offers to his \""family\"" truly challenged me as a viewer  and awed me to Mosely's subtle and amazing performance. Granted  he still has a few great  hilarious lines  specifically one referencing that OTHER madman in theaters right now  Willy Wonka.Aside from the Firefly clan  the supporting cast is terrific. William Forsythe is powerful and chilling as the sheriff driven by his brother's murder to enact revenge just as grisly as the Fireflys' crimes. The gang from \""Banjo & Sullivan\"" are utterly believable and help create some of the film's most haunting moments. Ken Foree is a delight to genre fans who will recognize him as the young cop in the original Dawn of the Dead  here portraying a struggling pimp with ties to Captain Spaulding. Danny Trejo and Diamond Dallas Page provide some truly sleazy moments as the Unholy Two  bounty hunters who are just as amoral as their prey. A truly stellar ensemble cast indeed.Rob Zombie nearly upstages this cast  however  with a script and style as visceral as the grittiest of 70s slasher originals (Last House on the Left  the Hills Have Eyes  and Texas Chainsaw all come to mind). Make no mistake  the Firefly family is vicious  unrepentant  and probably deserve the worst punishments Sheriff Wydell has in mind. They are rapists  killers  and sadists; in short  they are the darkest heart of America  and humanity itself. Why then do we pull for them? Why yearn for their escape? This is what puzzled and confused me  challenged me to think  and in short why I left the Devil's Rejects speechless. While some complained that it was not really scary  I found it truly frightening; that Rob Zombie could give a glimpse into the darkest acts of human depravity and still find some kinship with the perpetrators of such evil scared me. Unlike the over the top killers of House... this Firefly clan has bonds as strong as any family  and scant remnants of redemption beneath layers of evil.Visually  the film is stunning. Stark without being clich\u00e9d  Zombie pulls no punches and delivers a haunting vision of the heart of America. While some have complained it is \""not a real horror film \"" Zombie's vision is more frightening than any pilfered Americanized Japanese horrors of the past few years. Cannot come more highly recommended from a fan of the genre. If you're prepared to take a chance and be repulsed and drawn in to a world of depravity  see the Devil's Rejects.\tWhiny bullet resistant morons kill people  hide and then have it out with the law. It's like Faces of Death meets    ?? The Cannonball Run with a long layover at a Motel 6. After seeing all the ways it has been done in movies I for one am just frankly getting tired of seeing people getting gacked and having murder being passed off as story points.Earnestly  too earnestly  offensive  occasionally funny tho well shot. Rob Zombie said he didn't want people to cheer for these villains? Bull@#$%. Sad that he doesn't have the balls to admit what an exploitation film is really about.And I am not the smartest guy on my block. Far from it and my practical experience with gunplay is from computer games but even I could have managed the arrest or elimination of these bozos. The cops rivaled the badguys for dumbest team but I guess really that title has to go to the writers.\tWhen I went to see this movie I expected that the suspense and violence would be top notch  yet I was sort of let down. First off I would not classify this as a horror flick  it was more of a thriller/western/revenge film. The devil's reject group was more subdued this film  less killing  not to dramatic when they killed first lady all the way to the lady running with her husbands face on hers. I mean hell when tiny escapes at the beginning (avoids being captured) you know hes going to do something in the end to help the TDR out. That and the only people I would classify in this film as psychos were otis and the sheriff  they did most of the killing. I have to hand it to the lady who played Mother firefly she was acting like a total nut/psycho and it was great all the way til she got hers really made he character believable. Baby just sucked  no laughing  just acting like a 8 year old most of the time (plus being able to throw that knife through that ladies chest plate  crap!!!). Captian spaulding was pretty much the same character from the first although he seems to have it more together in this film  plus it showed hes not above harpooning whales. Otis was more like a lunitic woodsmen with that beard of his. The sheriff reminded me of some crusader nutjob who was just as violent  but somehow holy. But other than that most of the characters were just to bland to be remembered  too static. Hell I didn't even remember the bands that was killed nor the people killed  or why I should have even cared about what happened to them.Too much of this movie just did not sit well with me  it just wasn't what I was looking for. I would say i liked HOTC more because of the pure violence and satism (I know zombies not a Satan lover  besides that stuffs BS) That and bullcrap \""we got the drop on you\"" then messed it all up.Hopefully Mr. Zombie keeps making films he seems like hes caught onto the right track to revived horror moviesl  though next time leave out the god damn 5 min montage at the end.\tOh yeah kiddies... this is one sick  twisted  vile and depraved movie..FINALLY! This awesome movie makes I Spit On Your Grave  Last House On the Left  The Hills Have Eyes  look like Singing In the Rain! Now I ain't never been a fan of those old flicks...not because of the themes or violence  but because I always felt they didn't live up to their potential in acting  production and directing...well my fiends..er friends... the wait is over! Rob Zombie has created one of the most hardest R rated films in cinema! And I thank him for that! He's given a big \""F.U\"" to all those easy Rs and those sickening teenie pg-13 flicks.. this is sadistic and viley funny stuff! Don't go in looking for redeeming characters..its exlpoitation and the most well made of the genre. If you liked House of 1000 Corpses...well..you will LOVE this  as it surpasses that twisted ditty..only this time the directors second effort is as close to perfection as you're gonna get in this type of sleaze.. yeah..finally a movie that makes ya feel dirty for watching it  but yet you Don't wanna take a bath afterwards...but instead just sit there and revel in the filth! Hats off to Rob Zombie! a perfect 10/10!\tThis is the movie real \""horror\"" movie goers have been waiting for. If you are like me and praise the likes of \""The Hills Have Eyes\"" and \""Last house one the left\"" then look no further to capture that same feeling you once had experiencing the gritty filmaking that made those movies legendary. Do not listen to those teeny boppers who only go see horror flicks because a character from there favorite WB show is in it. The level of depravity and brutality of this film is overwhelming at times and may prove to be too much for the weak. Oh well  screw the week. all you geeks like me who organize horror movie and cult cinema nights take my advice and go see this film now. No review can sway my opinion because the only opinion I value is my own.... and some dude named Todd. Cheers to zombie for making an instant cult classic. Some tidbits- If house of 1k corpses threw you off a bit fear not. same characters/better movieThis is the return of KEN FOREE  my personal hero.The soundtrack is perfectly implemented in the movie.Gore level? Plenty of blood but the suggestion is more powerful. This is more of a \""sick to yer stomach\"" flick like most David Hess Films  you know that \""oh jeez  here it comes... then it doesn't...blam... and then it happened and your like WHOA!!! lol.\t...that goes without saying that it isn't by a lot. In a way  Rob Zombie's second film  'The Devil's Rejects'  affected me the same way his music does- it's usually self-indulgent  stylized like it's nobody's business  and at times its fairly entertaining stuff  but you know while you're listening to it there's better material in the genre. His first film  'House of 1000 Corpses'  was below average for my tastes  as he reveled in the fact that he was a writer/director of a horror film by making a Oliver Stone-esquire pastiche of the genre. This time around  he goes for a more conventional narrative  though saying that one must take into account that its in the framework of a raw  un-hinged  demented  exploitation crime film. So  there are some good points about it  if muddled under by the flaws.As with 'Corpses'  the film is style over substance  or story- the characters from the last film  the 'Fireflies' (led by Sid Haig  in a cheerfully disturbing performance)  are on the lam from Texas troopers  most particularly the vengeful Sheriff (played by William Forsythe  overplayed for good and bad results) who'll stop at nothing to see they pay for their crimes. On the way to hideout among friends (one of which Ken Foree  one of several obvious nods Zombie makes to past exploitation/horror films with cameos and small parts)  they continue the carnage. While watching the film though  one isn't as concerned with any real story as much as just the atmosphere  the fiends and victims who populate this late 1970's hillbilly environment Zombie has sprung up.The good parts are these- Zombie shows himself to be fairly adept at writing scathingly (and I mean scathingly like a iron to the face) witty dialog at times  mostly tongue-in-cheek  and has moments of inspired wild-ness in his style. He also has the good knowledge to let his actors go as nuts as possible  which helps at times to heighten the mood. But this leads into the bad sides of the film  one which some won't be bothered by (mostly die-hards I'd figure to exploitation flicks of the 70's) and some may be even more repulsed by than me: the Fireflys are  by Zombie's manipulation  by default the most sympathetic characters of the movie (when compared to the 'evil' police that is  and the innocuous victims). The problem is  despite some attempts to make them charming by some stretch  to get a viewer on the side of the anti-heroes  he doesn't succeed on this level.During parts of the film  including the ending scene (I won't reveal it  but to give an idea of the scene it's done with Skynyrd's 'Free Bird' blaring out)  I started to think about another filmmaker who's gone in the realm of the take-no-prisoners  on the side of the outlaws film-making  Quentin Tarantino. He's not a filmmaker immune to criticism  but in the sort of side-world he's created with From Dusk till Dawn and the Kill Bill films (connected by some similar characters) the anti-heroes have a kind of balance with their more sadistic and 'bad' side to get a viewer rooting for them almost. Zombie is so in love with his style of film-making and these people he's created  that he doesn't realize that these aren't very charming people at all (bullies and children almost all the way through)  and as the film heads towards a climax  it's hard to really root for anyone. Maybe that's the point  as a satire  but I just didn't get it  and by the big finale on a road in Texas  the whole experience of the film felt a little  well  average when in regards to the other 'shock' films Zombie pays tribute to.In short  the excesses that Zombie went with in 'Corpses' have sort of lingered on in 'Rejects'  and while there are some curious and 'cool' bits scattered about (along with a very good classic/souther-rock soundtrack)  it becomes a little boring at times too. I'm sure after this film that Zombie may make more movies  better ones perhaps  but with 'Rejects' he has made an uncompromising  violent  torrid  amusing  and ludicrous work here that does everything to call attention to itself...akin to his solo music work. It's the kind of film I can recommend more to some than others.\tKudos to Rob Zombie's masterful tribute to Grindhouse Cinema. Zombie has done for Grindhouse what the French New Wave did for Film Noir. And as with any successful tribute to art-style he brings his own freshness and vision to it. Bill  Sid and Sheri have created one of the most memorable gangs of demented murderers in the history of cinema. William Forsythe has his best part in years as the anti-hero sheriff. If a creepy gore-fest is your thing... this picture has it all. Sex  drugs and rock&roll. Like Peckenpah he is not glamorizing the violence  it's disgusting and he lets us know that's what it is. He makes the back roads of America seem a scary place. This is great movie-making. See it in a theatre with an audience. Not for everyone... but what good art is?\tThis movie was sick(by sick i mean awesome and disgusting at the same time)... Some parts were just plain disgusted  my mouth dropped. Some parts where just plain amazing (my mouth dropped). This movie showed the twisted way of life of 3 sick individuals. Even though it shows the evil side of the human race it also shows the good side as well. This movie was so well directed i didn't know who to root for. At times i wanted Otis and Captain Spalding to just beat on innocent victims. Then other parts I wanted the them to kill mercilessly. Possible Spoiler... The way Rob Zombie developed the characters that were killed in the hotel was unreal. No other movie develops victims. This is why Devil's Rejects is such a classic film. Rob Zombie shows the evil in the human race by showing how such \""badass\"" people kill innocent civilians. The Main characters of the story are murdering people of everyday life  such as people that are going to see Zombie's film. This is why this movie is so incredibly good. Another Possible Spoiler...Towards the end of the movie where The Rejects were about to be exterminated  i kinda was rooting for the Cop to finish these bastards off because of all the innocent people they have killed. When Tiny snapped the cops neck  i also felt a sigh of relief. These twisted emotions of both sides make this movie so AWESEOME i cant even explain. The end scene of the road block was unreal. This movie was an 8 until the end  now it is a 10. They knew they were going to die and they went out blasting guns. BY FAR THE COOLEST ENDING OF ANY MOVIE.\tFrom watching press about the movie and watching the trailers  I thought the movie was going to be far more shocking than it was. It was violent and had lots of bad talk  but I was more grossed out by the original dawn of the dead. That movie made me look away at points--one time when a zombie bites a large chunk out of a person in a close up. Also lacking in the movie was a story. Normally I wouldn't care  if there was action or good dialogue. But  the movie was too earnest and a bit cheesy. There wasn't too much to the movie. Not much happens--at all. I don't know what I expected really. I wasn't too fond of House of a thousand corpses. And what I liked about one  I liked about the other. Both movies were stylish and looked good--the visuals mixed with the music were really good. I didn't hate the movie. I just wanted more senseless crazy killing  than murders love their families too. The characters weren't out of control or sadistic enough. A movie that really scared me Was Twin Peaks: Come fire walk with me  I think that is what it is called. When it comes to directing  I give Rob Zombie his respect. He just needs more challenging plots or a crap load of weirdness. Overall  the movie was decent  but I can't say for sure. I'm confused about it.\tRob Zombie took the same characters he created for House of a Thousand Corpses and gave us a higher-budget  flashier  and more commercialized murder-shocker - The Devil's Rejects. This is certainly a prettier and more polished film  with better production values  occasionally brilliant camera-work  and better acting (despite having the same principal cast). The same elements of the original are mostly intact - a psychotic serial killing family  vaguely satanic sadism  comedy  torture and a lot of blood. What's missing are the ambiguities  the darkness and the outright psychosis which appear in \""House\"". And to compensate the audience for the loss of some of the elements which made \""House\"" a good film  Zombie throws in sex - the most over-used plot device in cinematic history. Of course  its not just sex  but sexual violence mixed with torture  blood and nightmares.In other words  where 'house' was a dark  campy  creepy murder flick  \""Rejects\"" is a light-drenched  raw  fairly (but not entirely) serious murder flick. No problems with the script  the acting  the concept  or even the plot - but  some definite problems with the entertainment value of the film. This just isn't terribly original and drops the idiosyncrasy of \""House\"" for a typical Hollywood approach. Rejects starts out with a police raid on the house of a thousand corpses. Most of the family escape through a tunnel in their basement (why the police were unable to find this tunnel is a mystery). The police nab the mother  who plays up the satanic expectations of the police interrogating her and infuriates the sheriff (well played by William Forsythe) into an obsessive  vengeful state (his brother had been murdered by the family years ago). The Fireflies leave a trail of terror and murder in their wake and Forsythe follows it  until he is able to set his trap. I won't go any further with the plot outline because I do not want to write a spoiler  but I do want to elaborate on Forsythe's intense performance. His rage and self-righteous wrath blur the boundaries between cops and criminals quite effectively as the story progresses. If you want to know what I mean  you'll have to see the film.The Firefly family  through most of the film  consist of Otis a lank tall man with long stringy gray hair  Captain Spaulding  an intimidating evil and merciless clown and Baby  Spaulding's daughter  a cute blond particularly fond of torturing her male victims. The characters are more or less consistent with their portrayals in \""House\""  but I have to admit  I think Shari Moon Zombie's Baby was very inconsistent from film to film. In \""House\"" she is completely and utterly insane and fearless - using her shrill psychotic laughter especially well. In 'Rejects'  she screams a lot  does a lot of running-away  and is actually fairly rational compared with her sadistic  torture-loving murderous kin.Finally  I don't think you can really 'get' this film if you haven't seen 'House'. So if you have any reason to want to see it  see \""House\"" first. Some of the behavior of the characters will make little sense to you without their back-story.Bottom line: Weakly recommended for horror fans.\tOK  I'm not a big Rob Zombie fan  but I do like some of his songs: Living Dead Girl and Superbeast. Even though I am a huge fan of pop music  there is a very soft spot on my heart for heavy metal and rock -n- roll music.As most of you know  if you have viewed my comments  I am a huge horror movie fan. I enjoyed House of 1000 Courpses; it had a Texas Chainsaw massacre feel and went back to the classic horror movie clique's that most horror fans truly enjoy. \""The Devil's Rejects\"" is by far more violent and scary. Like the commercial said \""They kill without reason\"". That's right! The family's back and they're more homicidal than ever! House of 1000 Courpses was a little edited you can tell by Rob's standards  I think he had more freedom with this movie. It is incredibly violent and in no way should be shown to children. I couldn't believe actually that it was only rated R. But I did for some sick reason enjoy it. I'm not sure why  maybe because I was just in a good mood for a gory flick.In this film  Baby and Otis completely torture this family  and I MEAN torture. Sexually  violently  mentally  your body just aches for what happens to them. But I'm not giving spoilers away. Captain Spawlding is back and he's a lot meaner than the first film. They finish off over dozen victims with a great ending playing a terrific song by the late great Lenord Skynord  \""Free Bird\"". \""And this bird you cannot change\"". It's true when it comes to this family. I would recommend this for Rob or House... fans. Otherwise  it's a pretty twisted movie that you might loose your stomach too.8/10\tThis is what i have to say about Devil's Rejects..I rooted against the good guys. I almost cried when Baby  Otis  and Spaulding were being tortured. I know it was just a movie  but after watching House of 1000 Corpses and then Devil's Rejects  I just fell in love with the characters. Rob Zombie did a wonderful job on humanizing the characters in Rejects. You see more sides to them than you did in House of 1000 Corpses. Leslie Easterbrook did a wonderful job playing Mother Firefly. Of course Bill Moseley  Sheri Zombie  and Sid Haig were wonderful as always. In the end you felt for the trio. Even though they were evil people. A lot of gore  violence  and horror. Very vivid. Made it very exciting to watch. I do believe that the ending could have been better.. but  it was a wonderful movie  and I do plan on seeing it again and again.\tI saw House  and loved it because of the sick humor mixed with crazy demonic imagery. It was what I would expect from Rob Zombie. It has it's corny moments  it's scary moments  it's brutal moments  it's sexy (slutty  actually) moments..etc. Just like the cheap B movies that we know Rob is so fond of.But Devil's Rejects wasn't like it's predecessor. It is a scary  unnerving  nauseating  sadistic  mind **** from beginning to end. Now  I knew it would be more 'realistic'  I guess  because of the environment. The actual house in \""House\"" was creepy  with Baby's room with the dolls  and Tiny's room  with the people locked up in the cages of dirty laundry. Especially in Dr. Satan's lair  lined with skulls  zombie-like experiments and dead bodies. Devil's rejects lacks that extra color  but makes up for it with extremely bothersome imagery. There is no restraint  or mercy in this movie. There is nothing cartoonish about it either.There is another review on this site that says the same things I am saying  but since I agree  I will reiterate.I've been complaining that all the recent horror movies have stunk  and are just cheap thrill fests. I went to Devil's Rejects and expected to see campy Zombie evil/fun  but instead got that scary movie I've been looking for. The characters were very well developed  however I do think good IL' Wydell was a bit over the top  especially during the little get together with the film expert  and a fight almost ensues for Elvis not being appreciated. Other than that  the character acting was great. And don't get me wrong  it has it's humor and funny moments  however sadistic they may be. They were all pretty funny.To sum up  the movie was superb. A good step for Zombie  while switching it up  and possibly losing a couple fans  he has struck a nerve in a genre that needed it  so hopefully this movie goes over well in the Box Office  and Zombie gets some funding for some more gorefests.Too bad Grandpa couldn't be in this one :-( he was pretty funny.\tFrom the end of my review of \""House of 1000 Corpses\"" a couple years ago: \""When we watch a horror flick  what exactly are we anticipating? Is the one-sided nature of the conflict (overwhelming villain  hapless or helpless victim) part of the appeal for us? Do we \""identify with\"" the chaser or the chasee? Should we feel a little ashamed of ourselves afterwards? Or  as Captain Spaulding put it  are these just a bunch of jack-ass questions?\"" Apparently not... For his \""not a sequel\"" \""The Devil's Rejects\"" Rob Zombie eschews his previous \""kitchen sink\"" approach to keep his camera mercilessly unblinkingly focused on the depredations (both physical and psychological) performed upon those doomed souls whose path happens to collide with Captain Spaulding and (we're now specifically informed) his kids Otis and Baby. Someone commented that at times this was like watching a \""snuff film\""; there's definitely a kind of \""Here it is take it or leave it\"" atmosphere. Some have accused Zombie of \""glorifying\"" or at least \""siding with\"" the vicious killers but if one looks at what's actually on screen instead of the baggage one brings with one  all he's really doing is showing us what's happening. If we accuse Zombie of \""wallowing in\"" the nastiness because he won't cut away from it  maybe he wants to remind us that pain and death really aren't just special effects; a bad deed only ends when the "
The Dukes of Hazzard (2005),"I am 28 and watched the original series.Honest quote  \whaddya wanna do tonight...oh i don't know  why don't we go see Dukes of Garbage?\""That's exactly what i thought about this movie when i read all the criticisms. This movie is the next in a long line of classic TV sitcoms made to Movies. Not all can capture enough of the original series to make it reliable to the watcher. Take for instance I Spy  FatAlbert  and Bewitched (yet to see this one).I think the Dukes actually does it. The only drawback is the modern day setting (but i think it still works since Harzard is redneck 1970's setting no matter what century we're in).Sure the acting was nasty  and the accents were somewhat over done. But  i am the only one to remember the original show. Bo looked like a bleach bum surfer  and Luke looked like a Chips wannabe. Both fit the Pop Culture attitude  looks  and fashions of the time to a tee.This version does the same. The producers also realized that Simpson would be the \""weakest link\"" and addressed it as the should have. She was used more as eye candy that original Daisy was  and had less speaking scenes than i thought. But at least it wasn't the demolishing of a strong female character that happened with \""Charlies Angles 2\"". The top 3 things any fan should ask is: 1. Is the car true to the original 2. Are the chase scenes true... 3. Are the characters true...Well  i think they deliver pretty well on the first 2. The 3rd  well not so much.Those of you born post 1985  and missed the show  check it out before condemning the movie as \""WORST MOVIE EVER\"". True fans that can't get over the differences b/w the original characters and these ones  just forget the movie  buy the DVD Seasons and remember the good IL' times.\tThis was the best movie ever. I saw it last night and I plan on going to see it tomorrow and probably 5 more times before it comes out on DVD. Jessica Simpson was beautiful in this. I don't know whats wrong with the guy above. I can't wait for the DVD. There was only one slow part about 2/3 of the way through but was quickly demolished with a car chase. After seeing the movie it made me wanna drive all over town. I plan on purchasing the soundtrack too.. a lot of very awesome songs are on the soundtrack. The chase scenes are unbelievable. You gotta love chargers. I can't believe they used 26 of them. Just go out and see the movie yourself. I promise you won't be disappointed. Go General Lee!!!\tWhat are you people talking about? How snobbish about films must you be to hate this movie? This was a very well made  funny  and surprisingly well acted film. And I really liked the Super Troopers references. I think that Willy Nelson did a great job as Uncle Jesse and I appreciated the end with Joe Don Baker and the \""smokehouse\"" scene. Burt Reynolds was THE best man for Boss Hogg. He just seemed to ooze the corruption of a southern aristocrat. And he looks good in a white suit. Speaking of looking good  Jessica FREAKIN Simpson is so FREAKIN hot in this movie! And even though I don't think the shorts were short enough  I was wrong about her being a bad choice. She brought all the sexiness and lustful curves that Daisy deserved. All in all  very good and I think if you're not some stuck up purist  you should see this movie.\tI have to say this isn't as big a disappointment as people are saying it is. It may just be because I was tired  and wasn't paying extremely close attention to everything  but I have to say this is a fun family-ish action/comedy. It has some good acting (nothing fantastic  but that doesn't really matter)  and it has a good plot. It doesn't try to over-complicate everything  it just tries to get the job done. It actually has some funny parts  example: someone gets hit in the crotch by a billiard ball. It even has some good one-liners like \""That's a phat suit  you some kinda  pimp or something?\"" Said by a guy in prison directed at Boss Hogg  and \""Were you wearing an armadillo helmet when you said it?\"" The second quote can't be explained easily  if you want to know about it  watch the movie.\tOK we all love the daisy dukes  but what is up with this cast. Lets start  Jessica Simpson as Daisy  there is not one thing country about this girl and Daisy was not ditzy! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest one to resemble the original. No offense to Burt  but I never noticed Boss HOg being so tall. That was part of the humor of Boss Hog was his size. Did they even try someone like Danny Devito?!? OK   now get this they cast Jessica Simpson did anyone take a look at her husband? He matches Luke Duke to a tee!!!!!! Cleary these producers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members. The screen t's were never present on the dukes!! This made the movie a turn off from the beginning. I give this a HUGE thumbs down.\tI am surprised at how low the scores are for this movie. My least favorite movie of all time has a higher score (Blair Witch 2).But let me tell you  at no point was I tempted to walk out of the theater - I enjoyed almost every minute. I am 32 years of age and loved the show when I was a kid - if you didn't like the show  then I certainly wouldn't waste your time with this movie. And if you are going to get upset because this is a sexually charged  NON-family movie  save your cash. The Dukes are a swearing  moonshine-drinking  woman-chasing bunch. I definitely DO consider myself to be a movie snob - I appreciate good movies  and have become a huge fan of foreign / art films. I'm not saying \""Dukes\"" is in the same ballpark as a really good movie - I certainly won't be purchasing the DVD - but don't be automatically scared away by the terrible reviews. And for what this is worth - the audience that I viewed the movie with was laughing  clapping hands  and clearly enjoyed the film.Happy viewing!\tAs mediocre as the acting was the movie was all together good. Its a comedic action flick that shares the 'thrillbilly' feeling that the dukes are so notorious for. I may not have chosen Knoxville or Sean for their roles  but when its all said and done i cant think of anyone else i would have picked. Call me a guy but Jessica cant act worth a lick  especially with her phony/modified real accent  but i wasn't paying close enough attention to any of that to make an actual judgment. Willie rocks  Lynda is gorgeous like shes always been  the characters aside from their new age modification were nice. I give this film an 8 only because i cant give it a 7.something. I wasn't impressed by anything but it was fun to watch  and i laughed uncontrollably several times. The cameos from other new age cult comedies were also very nice. Lets also remember the show was nothing prolific. Both the movie and show are based on the same equation.Fast Car+Pretty Girl+Funny tight knit cousins+Impossible car crash after impossible car crash=Good IL' time\tI know many people have already written this movie off because it looks stupid or inane. While I'm not trying to defend this movie as some great work of cinematic genius  it is what it is  an entertaining movie. Most people might not want to see it because it's a movie about rednecks played by less than quality actors  or because it is untrue to the original series. If that's the case  then don't waste your time or money to see the movie only to gripe about it later. If you're in the mood for a feel good movie with some alright action sequences  a typical bombshell female role and entertaining characters  then I'm sure you'll enjoy. Liking this movie doesn't mean your immature  all it means if you enjoy a good time with some friends watching a movie you can laugh at later  unlike the erudite movie-goers that look down on this kind of genre because it lacks a profound statement of humanity or moral character.\tThis movie is so bad  the Cliff's Notes explaining just how bad it is would be an inch thick. Don't go see it  don't rent the DVD. When the commercial for it defiles your TV  change the channel quickly or risk permanent damage to your mind and the minds of your friends and families. Yuck. Watch the TV series if you must. I watched it when I was much younger and admit that nostalgia was the key to my being tricked into catching the new one. 1. Burt Reynolds was once A-list Hollywood talent. Look into his backlist. 2. Willie Nelson is a legend in the American music scene. Look into his music  even if you don't like country-- I don't enjoy the genre  but I like his stuff. 3. Jessica Simpson is an attractive young woman. 4. In my opinion  Seann William Scott has been funny in other movies. 5. Johnny Knoxville is that Jackass guy  right?May the unquiet spirit of Waylon Jennings forgive them all.\tdon't take your girlfriend to this movie because the only good part about it is half naked Jessica Simpson. mmmmmmmmmm  Jessica Simpson. the movie itself had an extremely weak plot with some decent car chases. general lee was looking beautiful and Knoxville and stifler deliver and OK performance. Burt Reynolds will melt your face with his pimp suits and Roscoe p. Coltrane has totally unbelievable sideburns. the plot itself doesn't seem to make much sense just little kid hijinks with Willie nelson appears to be a walking anti-drug scare advertisement. to end the summary i recommend that you go out to a music store and buy the chariot's CD because that is way better than this movie. also  Jessica Simpson is hot.\tThis movie although I give it 10 out of 10 it still was just not casted properly. M.C. Gainey as Rosco was good only because he has his dog flash other than that he just did not act like Rosco acts. Burt Renolyds as Boss Hogg was not that great and good of used some work. They should have shaved his head  lost the beard  and put him in a fat suit. Sean and Johnny were terrible as the duke boys they just did not look the part. Nelson as Uncle Jesse was decent enough. Simpson as Daisey was good  but not great. I am glad that Cooter was in the movie and we even saw Enos and Cletus as deputies. That should have been all the law enforcement they had since that was all they had in the original series. All in all the best character in this entire movie was the car The General Lee.\tBen Jones has been making a lot of noise about how the new film adaptation bears very little resemblance to the original The Dukes of Hazzard television series. I'm not sure he realizes that he's inadvertently praising the film in the process  though.Anyway  I saw it this afternoon. Jones is right. It's basically a gutted and refashioned re-telling of the Dukes' tale\u0097the only things which remain intact are the characters and the setting. Johnny Knoxville's Luke Duke and Sean William Scott's Bo Duke are much more like the good IL' boys I've always encountered in the South than Wopat and Schneider ever were. They're careless  a little stupid  and work \""blue\"" through most of the movie. The rest of the cast is a little stiff  although I applaud the producers for not trying to pick new players and force them to re-act the show's versions of their respective characters. The Roscoe P. Coletrane of the film is plain mean  where he was just a bumbling idiot in the show. Burt Reynolds' interpretation of the Boss Hogg character was likewise much colder and devious than Sorrell Booke's character  making him a lot easier to root against. The only real stumbles in the new casting were Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke (she's certainly no Catherine Bach) and Willie Nelson as Uncle Jessie  neither of whom fully embraced the warmth and good nature inherent to their characters. Still  Willie Nelson's one-liners (as out of step with the script as they were) were often hilarious.Finally  there's the flag. The Confederate flag. People are boycotting this film because of a flag painted on top of a car! Despite the fact the film addresses the flag's ugliness on several occasions  often with a self-aware tongue-in-cheek sense of humor  the people who are causing a stink about it will never know.For mindless summer entertainment that's all one big in-joke (with mad chase scene action)  The Dukes of Hazzard is a solid B+.\tThis movie was awesome. The pacing was great...it never dragged. Also  it was hilarious  and the car scenes were a lot of fun. Very much stayed true to the \""Dukes of Hazzard\"" series I remembered  and it's always a pleasure to see Willie Nelson on screen.I heard that one of the original cast members complained about the movie being too sexual. Yes  it is sexual  but so was the original! It was never the \""family\"" show that people are claiming it once was. Also  the cast member who made that comment was later revealed to have auditioned for the movie and been turned down  so take what he said with a grain of salt.If you want deep drama  don't see this movie. But if you want to have a great time and don't take yourself too seriously  this flick's for you!\tThe Dukes of Hazzard was hilarious! There's action  comedy and suspense in the must see movie of the year. The movie was great. Cars jumping stuff exploding Uncle Jesse's Hilarious jokes. Luke and his CRAZY antics. It's really just a great entertaining movie. And who could forget Daisy and Bo? There are some really funny moments in the movie too. I suggest everyone goes to see it. The whole gang is here----Cooter Boss Hogg Daisy Bo Luke Uncle Jesse  etc. The performances were GREAT. The movie was hilarious. What else can I say? A great movie  great cast and the outtakes at the end of the movie when the credits go up are just as funny as the movie! You have to stay and watch the credits!\tI thought this movie was excellent. Obviously this is a light summer movie that isn't supposed to be like Oscar winning or anything but it's great for a good laugh. If you are looking for an intelligent movie this isn't the right one for you. Johnny Knoxville and Sean William Scott are the funniest pair I've seen in a long time. They are so believable as Bo and Luke Duke. Jessica Simpson is pretty good as well. She made an excellent Daisy Duke  I don't think anyone else could have done better. I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. I recommend it for sure and I am no doubt going to see this one at least one or two more times!\tThis movie contained one element that's been missing in movies for quite a while now: FUN. This isn't Citizen Kane. This isn't Star Wars. This is a sit back  relax  and enjoy some free-spirited excitement. It was refreshing to see how Stiffler (Scott) and Jackass (Johnny Knoxville) each worked their comedic personas. Knoxville gave us a few Jackass style stunts. Scott gave quite a few American Pie sex-related laughs. As for keeping with the style and feel of the original show: not really. BUT the car chases are exciting and the General Lee looks incredible. Daisy Duke is amazing... looking. It was fun seeing the characters from the show (Rosco  Enus  Cooter  etc..) reproduced on the big screen. Some older viewers will get a kick out of Linda Hamilton (Wonder Woman)  Willie Nelson  and The Bandit himself : Burt Reynolds. I can't express how refreshing a fun movie is during a time period of massive right wing oppression and the \""media\"" telling us daily that we could all die tomorrow.\tWhen I went to go see this movie  I had the lowest of expectations and was not looking forward to it at all.I was surprised to find it very entertaining  with some shining parts. The movie plays with putting the Duke boys in the \""modern\"" world  like being stuck in traffic and being publicly scorned for having the Confederate flag on their car. It also toys with other aspects of racism that aren't crude or anything.Also  the movie knows its sh** don't smell like roses  and doesn't takes itself too seriously  which makes it more enjoyable. Its not cynical or ironic  like the recent Bewitched or Starsky and Hutch movies. Its a good ole' time with a deep south soundtrack and rough and tumble actors. Also  Jessica Simpson's booty evoked \""Damn  she is FINE!\""'s from the audience.\tthis is totally the best movie ever. It was very exciting  hilarious  and lots of fun to watch  just like the TV show.Jessica Simpson couldn't be more perfect in this film - she is by far the hottest girl on this universe  and every straight man in the world will love how holy crap oh my god sexy she is.This movie was great  and the bloopers at the end cracked everyone up in the theater. There were some parts that were a little messed up. There were never that many police in the TV show for starters. Secondly  the shower scene at the beginning where Uncle Jessie was walking in on Daisy was really corny. I knew she wasn't going to be naked or actually showering; her boobs were round and tight through the shadow through the shower curtain  and they would be hanging down because she's so sexy  if she was really showering. I knew she was clothed. I loved it and everyone else should too. I hope this movie wins some sort of award; if they make a Sexiest Actress award  this one will win.\tJust saw the movie today and have to say I really enjoyed it. Anyone reading the reviews has to ignore those that speak about it being miscast. Honestly its a remake of the old TV show. I don't mind having a skinny boss hog or a blonde daisy duke. The characters in this movie give their own up to date spin of the happenings in Hazzard county and pull it off very well. My jaw dropped whenever the General Lee was in a chase.. and thats about 80% of the movie. So believe me it was a fun action ride the whole time. So please don't go by the very biased reviews given on this page and go see a good fun movie.Winkster out!\tI laughed so hard I almost cried.This movie was exactly what I expected it to be: A fun mindless ride where we watch hick country boys blow stuff up and race around in a hot cars.Was every joke a hit and will it ever be up for an academy award: no.However the good far out way the bad.This movie might not be for everyone however.Here is a little quiz to find out if this movies is for you...If your heart soars at the thought of muscle cars making outrageous jumps over conveniently placed washed out bridges: this film is for you.If you are the sort who is prone to self-righteous monologue: this film is not for you.If the thought of blowing stuff up makes your heart skip a beat: this film is for you.If you like to laugh and enjoy outrageous people doing outrageous things: this film is for you.If it hurts you to witness the nearly nude female form: this film is not for you.If you are afraid of what people might think of you if you admitted to liking a film like this: paint a big rebel flag on top of your car (life is too short for that sort of fear ;) ).No matter what your score on the above quiz  go see the film anyway  get in touch with your inner-hick and get in some chuckles.YEEE-HAAAAAAAAA!!! :)"""
The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005),"Those moviegoers who expect to see this movie and expect a Exorcism ala Linda Blair will not be disappointed. There a few scenes when delving into the actual exorcism which the young actress performed in an apt and realistic manner.However  this movie is more of a dramatic thriller rather than a horror film. I as always am very impressed with the talented Laura Linney. She never fails to bring complexity and range to each character. I felt that oddly the movie was more about Erin Bruner rather than Emily Rose. I was expecting a slightly stronger ending to the film.I do recommend seeing this movie in theaters for the chill effect. It did spark an interest in Emily Rose and I plan to do more research.\tThis movie was advertised as being a thriller  but what they don't show is that the whole thing is a trial. The only parts that are shown on television are the small sections that are flashbacks during the trial. The acting by the prosecutor (he's some unknown actor) is laughable  it's so bad. Laura Linney isn't anything to write home about  either. The people in the theater where I saw it (I saw it on the preview night  August 25)  were laughing at all the wrong parts. I'm pretty sure we weren't supposed to be laughing during the prosecutor's opening statements  or when the defendant was recalling seeing a horrific demon; but as I said earlier  the acting was extremely novice. I am a high school teacher and I saw some of my students there. One of them said she fell asleep and the other one said that she and her boyfriend thought about leaving before the ending  but didn't because her mom would have made her go to bed early! I've seen children's movies with better endings and more bang for your buck. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE (especially if you are a horror movie fan!)\tThe Exorcism of Emily Rose is based upon a true story  the events that lead up to the death of Emily Rose. Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) was a young college student  who believed she was possessed. Her family and her pastor did everything they could to save her.This was not your typical horror flick. Though there are some scary scenes throughout  this story is more about Emily Rose and her story. A story that her pastor  Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson)  tries desperately to tell during his trial. Erin Bruner (Laura Linney)  Moore's attorney  tries to defend Moore whom she believes is a good man. This movie scares you without confirming Emily Rose's possession. Despite the horror angle  this movie is also about self-sacrifice  love and loyalty.I think horror movie fans might be disappointed with this  however  I thought it was really good. A scary movie with a good plot and a good message.\tScott Derrickson does many things right in this little \courtroom horror\"" picture. His possession scenes are top notch  with most of the chills coming from jarring camera work and generally only subtle special effects. Rarely is a special effect in this film more than a digitally altered scary face or subtly enhanced human ability (as often seen in The X-Files). The rest is done through editing  lighting  and scoring. I believe that Derrickson did this for a very specific reason - to add credibility to both sides of the courtroom argument. Was Emily possessed by demons or mentally/physically ill? Emily's feats of strength  obscene bodily contortions  and other frightening abilities can all be explained by both science and religion. For some of the more supernatural moments that Emily experiences  Derrickson lets us observe from two perspectives: demonic influence and objective science. Since this is of course a horror picture  there are noticeably more scenes of the former. This is a good thing because Derrickson unfortunately does not handle drama very consistently in this picture. Several key moments in the film  including a fervent assertion made by the district attorney  that should have resonated with the audience instead made everyone in the theater laugh at the scene's ridiculousness. Still  the scares are top notch (particularly a long exorcism scene which begins like Friedkin's Exorcist but then takes some surprisingly different turns) and presenting both religious and scientific explanations for the possessions (which was never an option for the head-spinning  levitating Reagan) will satisfy both believers and skeptics. Worth seeing.\tI had the opportunity to view an advance showing on Thursday  August 25th. I didn't find one 'dull' spot what-so- ever. There's not much to say that wouldn't spoil the ending  although the ending for the most part was slightly predictable. It's what happens before ... the flash-backs  trial testimony  the suspense that wasn't predictable. I will most likely see this again once it hits the theaters. I was not the only one in the theater to 'jump out of my seat'. Although only rated PG-13  I personally would not recommend viewing by anyone under the age of 18  due to the intensity and religious beliefs. And to know this was based on a true story is the most disturbing ... I'm still wondering if she was possessed  or was it actually epilepsy?? Watch and make your own decision ... just be sure to keep a tight grip on your popcorn!\tI wanted to make a comment pertaining to the movie since I was able to view a sneak preview last night. Without revealing too much I will just advise that the beginning had everyone on the edge of their seats  but eventually the movie switched focus from Emily Rose to long drawn out courtroom scenes that at times were very anti-climactic. Other than that  the film was quite good  not great  but not corny either. I also felt that the characters stories involved in the prosecution and defense of the priest who performed the exorcism on Emily Rose were poorly written and were void of any depth. Although Laura Linney gave a great performance. Even a brief appearance by a secret eyewitness which I thought would have lead to something exciting  was over just as fast as it began. I was hoping for more focus and background on Emily Rose herself. The movie still wasn't half-bad  I recommend renting it when out on DVD  but if you're a fan of being scared out of your seat  watch the movie in the theatre for the effects.\tOne of the trailers for \""The Exorcism of Emily Rose\"" is for the forthcoming 2005 remake of the John Carpenter movie \""The Fog.\"" While that movie will no doubt provide a thrill or two  just watching it  you know it won't be the same kind of level that the brilliant \""Emily\"" brings. While that will have killings and \""boo\"" moments and the usual  this movie right here is something intellectual  deliberately paced  and  ultimately  genuinely terrifying.While not revealing too much  the plot focuses on the trial of a priest (Tom Wilkinson)  convicted with the negligent death of young Emily Rose (a breakout performance from Jennifer Carpenter). Laura Linney plays Erin Bruner  in charge of his defense  while Campbell Scott proves why he's one of the most under-appreciated actors today with his venomous role as the district attorney. The priest and Rose's family say she was possessed by a demon  while the prosecution says she was epileptic and the priest  Father Moore  ultimately lead her to her gory demise.This is where the movie turns convention on its head: the story is told almost entirely in flashback. While one would think that this would weaken the story  it does not. As a matter of fact  Father Moore's testimony on the exorcism itself and it's inherent flashback are the most terrifying events seen in cinemas for years. In viewing these sequences  one cannot help but think back to its superior and obvious forbearer: \""The Exorcist.\"" Yet  \""Emily\"" is not a renamed remake of it by any means. As a matter of fact  for once you get to see what Emily sees  which is really drawing from more elements of the oft-neglected Tim Robbins' movie \""Jacob's Ladder\"" than anything else. In a rare event  the special effects never ONCE look fake  adding further to the sheer terror of the film. The score is brooding and creates a squeamish and uneasy mood (especially during Emily's first \""posession\"" in her dorm)  and the script  for once  actually goes through religious symbolism analysis in compelling detail  not once ever dumbing down to the audience. This isn't a non-stop terror thrill ride - it's a smart one that knows when to play it safe  and when to scare your pants off.Given that  it should be noted that \""Emily\"" isn't perfect. The script makes Father Moore say \""dark powers\"" and \""dark spirits\"" way too much  and a few might not like how it ends somewhat low-key (though the climax is extraordinary). Yet when you come down to it  you have a phenomenal horror movie. Hopefully it will ascend to the ranks of modern-day classics  and people won't write it off as derivative  because it's not. \""Emily\"" will make you think  sometimes laugh (it knows when to place a good joke to break tension)  but ultimately scare you - no other film in recent memory has done it better.\t(this review contains spoilers) I just saw a pre screening of TEER. The movie is about the so called possession and subsequent death of a college student during an exorcism.The priest that conducted the exorcism is under trial for her death and we have a courtroom drama over the event. The first 2/3 of the movie was great and was building momentum only to slow down the last 1/3. We don't get much info into how she became possessed  why she was alone in her dorm at the time  or why she allowed the devil in... but there were some genuine scary moments especially when you thought she  Laura Linney's character and /or the priest were going to meet the devil. This suspense more then makes up for the slow courtroom ending. The film didn't try to pass judgement either way as to whether she was or wasn't possessed  leaving it up to the viewer. It never really answered whether Linney's character actually believed her client (the Priest) nor did it give much credible evidence to prove or disprove the event. The courtroom was where the movie bogged down. This was a basic prosecution/defense debate with a very predictable ending. The ending was also very flat leaving a lot of questions unanswered. The devil was apparently after Linney but somehow stopped...The screening I attended did not have the priest say \""no injection of the devil\""  nor was there any levitation (that I read occurred elsewhere). There was also nothing about her body being exhumed to find a decomposed corpse which the catholic church said meant that she wasn't possessed (since the possessed do not decompose)There was no gory  bloody  graphic effects other then a twisting  stiff twitching of her body at times. All in all an entertaining movie that does an OK job of suspense minus the courtroom drama. 6.5 out of 10\tthough the acting was good  I was a bit disappointed the movie didn't explore more of the family background. The supposed possession and exorcism scenes were told in flashback. I came away with the impression either side could glean evidence of mental illness or possession depending on your beliefs. Whatever the case it was tragic. I will add the actor playing Emily could really scream up a storm. The movie was also pretty faithful to the actual trial from what I could see. I attended a preview last week and will probably see it again when it comes out. The restraint of the film was noted by me and my friends too because it didn't scare solely for the sake of sensation. The possibility of true possession does not interfere with the medical details and vice-versa. All said the movie allows for either belief system.\tDoes anyone know the name of the book that the movie was based on? I thought that at the end of the movie  when they were doing updates  it said the movie was based of The Life and Death of Emily Rose. But i can't find it anywhere. Does anyone know where I can get the book or the title or it? I can't find any info on Emily Rose and I would like to read up on her. Where anyone believes the story or not something happen to her. Be it a mental illness or demons and I would like to find out what it was. I don't what anyone thinks I was touched by her. To think a young girl must go through something like that. it must have been horrible for her and those around her.\t\""The Exorcism of Emily Rose\""...I bought a ticket for this movie expecting to see a remake of \""The Exorcist\""  but I was wrong. This should definitely be considered a horror movie  just not to a degree of \""The Exorcist\"". This movie focuses more on leaving a cliffhanger at the end. The question  does Emily have epilepsy  or is she really possessed  goes through unanswered.There is virtually no suspense at all  something that caused me to give this movie an average score. Throughout the film  I could successfully predict what would happen  and that isn't something good in a horror movie. I must admit though  there were a few scenes that caused me to \""jump\"" which  in my belief  was the goal. These scenes range from subtle sound effects to cinematic visual effects. There is one scene in particular  in which we (the audience) see things from Emily's perspective  and realize just how warped her mind has become.The characters are developed  but not enough. The acting is good  especially from Jennifer Carpenter  the woman playing Emily Rose. She is screaming most of the time  but her facial expression can be clearly seen and understood.Overall  this is an above average horror film  but it is not one of the better movies of it's genre. I was tempted to rate lower  but this movie did make me think. The one question in the movie is never answered  leaving viewers to fend for themselves. However  a thousand more questions come to mind as well. Questions that aren't meant to be answered. Life...Death...Purpose...so many questions that need answers  and yet we have so little time to search...\tduring the movie at one point in the courtroom. The prosecuting attorney makes an argument about how \""Emily\"" spoke in two voices simultaneously. He said that the human body has two sets of vocal chords (this is true) and Emily used them both to speak Hebrew and Aramaic at the same time. OK fine right? WRONG!!! you might be able to make two different  but similar SOUNDS at the same time  however you only have one mouth and one tongue  you CANNOT ENUNCIATE both languages simultaneously!!! So  if this point was made in the actual case that the movie was based on  how come my point wasn't brought up? I'm no doctor but thats just too obvious!!\tFirst off  the trailer IS misleading. I originally found out about the misleadings before I went to go see it  so I knew ahead of time it would not be like the trailer intended it to be.In the end  I gave this movie a 5 out of 5. If it were on a 10-scale rating  it would be a little under a 9  but I found it good enough to give it a 5 in the 5-scale rating.Pros: {{Great story line.}} If you're into the story of the movie  this is a good one to see. As long as you get into it  you'll be able to immerse yourself into the movie experience and have a true feeling for the story. -- {{Great acting.}} I found the performance of Jennifer Carpenter (Emily Rose) in the mind-boggling contortions to be an awesome addition to the film. It truly made me believe she was stuck in those positions w/o will. -- {{True story to movie similarities.}} If you read the true story  they made it a lot like the real-life story. From her seeing demonic images to her eating spiders and speaking in foreign tongues  I found it quite life-like to the real-life story.Cons: {{Trailer misleading.}} Like stated before  the trailer is misleading. You're expecting to go and see a SCARY movie  but in the end you feel a bit disappointed because it's more creepy than it is scary and  if anything  only makes you feel scared sleeping by yourself at night. -- {{Lots of conversation.}} If you get bored easily of continuous talk and debate  this movie is probably not meant for you. This movie is more of a court discussion than anything else which will leave people desiring less talk and more action/screams. -- {{Ending kind of ruins it.}} I'm not the only one on this  others agree that the ending kind of left you saying  \""Huh? That's it?\"" You're kind of left with a feeling of incompleteness with the movie because it ends in a \""dull\"" manner. Throughout the entire movie you have a feeling of doubt and what's going to happen next so you're in suspense. Then the ending hits leaving you wanting more. (If you see it  you'll understand my point of view exactly.)In the end I still gave it a 5 out of 5 simply because I'm the type of movie critic that loves a great story and doesn't mind too much talk. But TRULY it's all up to your final decision on whether you'll like this movie or not. You'll just have to watch it for yourself and decide.GL to all you movie-goers out there! ;)\tTitle: The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005) Director: Scott DerricksonCast: Jennifer Carpenter  Tom Wilkinsonm  Laura Linney Review: It feels like its the 70s all over again. The 70s a time when religious themed horror movies spawned every other day. That decade saw the birth of such classics as as The Exorcist  The Omen and Rosemaries Baby. But like many Hollywood fads they deluded into a series of bad clich\u00e9d horror films that stopped being scary and turned funny instead. Now here comes the rebirth of the religiously themed horror movie in the form of The Exorcism of Emily Rose and I gotta say  I welcome the return of these themes with open arms.The story is based on the real life events of a young German called Anneliese Michel. A 19 year German girl who in 1976 died during an exorcism approved by the Catholic Church. The movie centers around the defense attourney Erin Bruner  who has to protect the rights of Father Moore the catholic priest who was performing the exorcism and who is now blamed for Emily's death. The movie explains the events leading to the exorcism in a series of flashbacks that are shown whenever a new witness is brought to the stand. So in other words  this is basically a courtroom movie with a horror twist.The interesting aspect of this film is the way the story is told. Right from the get go you know that Emily dies in the exorcism which gets you thinking  well  I already know how the movie is going to end  wheres the fun in that. Well the fun in this flick is not the what...but the how. How the events unfolded which lead to the horrible death that Emily suffered. So in spite of the fact that Emilys story is told through a series of flashbacks  the movie manages to be extremely interesting and gripping. With every chilling flashback more and more of the story is revealed right to its chilling conclusion.Now this movie isn't as flashy as perhaps The Exorcist and let me explain why. We all know the exorcist is famous for its over the top head spinning  spider like crawling  vomit spewing  floating above the bed antics. And that movie is great for those delivering us those shocks  but with Emily things are a bit more real. Those scenes of Emily possessed are frightening in their own way  but its just not as special effects oriented as perhaps The Exorcist was. And I think its because the events were not blown out of proportion simply for making a gee wheez special effects filled horror show. No  here the scares come simply because of the fact that these events could have occurred exactly as you see em on the screen. And believe me this movie gets to people  the audience I watched it with was on its tips and toes every moment of the way  the high pitched screams of the girls in the audience let me know that.But don't get the wrong idea  even though this movie isn't heavy on the razzle dazzle special effects  the exorcism/possession scenes are something truly amazing  and terrifying. From horribly contorted bodies to eating insects to speaking in unknown languages...Emilys possession is something frightening in deed.As far as performances go this one is out standing  Jennifer Carpenter has to mentioned because of her grueling tortured performance of a girl tormented  either by her mental condition or the demons she claimed possessed her. With out a doubt the performance that shines the most is hers. Tom Wilkinson and Laura Linney do their thing and its all good and great but Carpenter is the one who steals the show.The spooky factor is very high on this one. I'm guessing its because everyone can identify with these themes. Who doesn't think that their might be dark forces willing to screw with people  dark forces who might pull your bed sheets at night or make your life a living hell. This is the main reason why this movie keeps people at the edge of their seats. But for those of you who bend more to the scientific side of things  don't fret  this movie doesn't just show the supernatural side of things. It also dwells into the scientific and rational explanation of things. This is a movie that will satisfy both the skeptic and the believer. There's an ambiguity about the flick that balances things just perfectly  if this movie had a religious denomination it would be agnostic  like its main character attourney Erin Bruner.And I must say I really enjoyed that angle because in previous movies of this nature they make it seem as if everyone in the world is catholic and that their religious is the one an only true one. On this film its different because the main character is agnostic and even in one point of the film they bring an expert on exorcisms and she goes on about how this sort of thing happens in different religions all around the world  not just with catholics. So its a good thing that filmmakers were aware of this and made its story more accessible to everyone even those who aren't catholics.In conclusion  a great movie thats sure to spook you with its religious themes and a great performance from Jennifer Carpenter. A worthy addition into the \""religious horror\"" shelf.Rating: 5 out of 5\tIt was painful to sit through because the commercial hyped the film as scary. Anything remotely scary was so spread out through the movie it was impossible to create any tension or \""spookiness.\"" Just when you thought things were getting underway the movie went back to the courtroom. The commercial was definitely scarier than the movie! They were obviously trying to run off of the coattails of the Exorcist. I don't remember seeing a single courtroom scene in the previews. It's extremely disappointing when you go to a movie expecting to be entertained and then find out the movie is a courtroom drama! There was a lot of groaning and looking at watches in the theater. I had huge expectations for this movie. I can't help but feel mislead. Not many satisfied people leaving the theater!\tExpectations. Almost all of life's joys and disappointments hinge on expectations. If they're met we go home happy. If they're not met we go home frustrated. And if they're exceeded then we go home thrilled  and breakfast tastes just a little bit sweeter the next morning. If you've ever wondered why so many people set their standards low  well  it's so that they can't help but be exceeded. What is failure other than neglecting to meet expectations? Anyway  all that is a long-winded way of saying that your enjoyment of The Exorcism of Emily Rose will most likely correlate with your expectations. I think the marketing department made a mistake in trying to push this as a horror movie. As much (if not more) time is spent in the courtroom as it is on Emily Rose's supposedly possessed screams and contortions.If you're expecting and desiring straight-up horror and scares then those expectations will not be met. There are some creepy moments  but this really isn't all that frightening. Granted  movies don't scare me that easily. Typically  a walk at night in downtown Memphis is required to manage that. However  there was a guy behind me that started reciting \""The Lord's Prayer\"" at one point. I don't know if this was an overreaction on his part and he was actually scared (wuss) or if he was just a moron who was trying to be cute. Either way  I never felt any sense of fear or dread.What I did feel was a genuine interest in the story and the courtroom proceedings. The movie is most effective when flashbacks are telling Emily Rose's story. I especially liked how the movie presented both sides of the case. In one scene we'll see things from the point of view that Emily is all demon-possessed and whacked out like she's Tom Cruise in love  and then we'll see the same scene from a medical/scientific viewpoint.But where the movie let me down was in the distortion of the real facts of the case. Yes  as the prologue tells us  this is \""based on a true story.\"" Those words should always have you reaching for your grain of salt (a necessary item at most movies these days). This should come as no surprise  but two minutes worth of research reveals that the case this is based on (the girl's real name was \""Anneliese Michel\"" not \""Emily Rose\"") bears little resemblance to the overly dramatic portrayal that the movie gives us.I know it's just a movie  but I couldn't help but be skeptical once everything started to get a little too coincidental. Something happens to a key witness  Laura Linney starts to see dark figures  we're falsely informed that there was only one exorcism and it took place on Halloween  Laura Linney starts to wake up every night at 3:00 AM. The priest tells the audience that this is significant because it's known as \""the demonic witching hour.\"" It's an inversion of 3:00 PM - one theoretical time of Christ's death. At this point I started to think  \""Oh come on  now THAT can't be part of the true story.\"" My skepticism started to become a distraction.Plus  it didn't help that I had  \""And she says baby  it's 3:00 AM I must be lonely!\"" running through my head. Matchbox 20 lyrics always have a way of ruining a mood.But that's just a small complaint. I was disappointed when I got home  did some research  and found out that most of the movie's details regarding the possession and the priest's statements were indeed fictional and had nothing to do with the real case. My doubts were confirmed. I suppose you have to twist the facts and dramatize everything when you're trying to scare people  but I was hoping this would be a case where truth really was stranger than fiction. I convinced myself to expect that would *not* be the case  so my expectations were met and I went home happy. I was just hoping my Kroger brand cinnamon pop tart would taste sweeter the next morning. Oh well  maybe next time.THE GIST The Exorcism of Emily Rose is an entertaining movie as long as you get what you're expecting. I recommend you go in expecting a courtroom drama with horror elements and a fictional story with tidbits of truth and you should go home entertained. After all  joy and disappointment hinge on expectations  so sometimes it's best to have a good idea of what to expect.\tExorcisms have been carried out by the Catholic Church for hundreds of years. It is basically the removing or calling out of demons from people who have been \""possessed\"". Who knows for sure what goes on during these rituals. The Catholic Church doesn't say much  but what we understand from books and more recently in movies is that they are not pleasant and can be quite terrifying.Director Scott Derrickson brings to the screen The Exorcism of Emily Rose. A true story about a girl named Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter)  a 19 year old farm girl who was looking forward to going off to college. But this wouldn't be any ordinary semester. It would be at school where she would become possessed by what seems to be demonic forces.The movie opens to the investigation of Emily Rose's death. Her family's priest Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson) is under arrest for negligent homicide due to the unsuccessful exorcism and ultimately leading to her death days later. The archdiocese appoints Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) to defend father Moore in his trial. Bruner has her head held high due to her last case where she got what seemed to be a murderer off. She says that she has no decisive religion but will be dealing with a whole lot through this case.The main question that can't be answered completely is whether or not Emily was actually suffering from a form of epilepsy and psychosis or if she truly was under the influence of demonic forces. Father Moore only wants to tell Emily's story  he wants to relay her message from all of this to the world so they can see what it truly feels like living a tortured life.The movie offers a lot to be absorbed. It asks us to really check ourselves and if we believe that their is a scientific purpose for everything or whether or not supernatural occurrences can be the answer to the unknown like in this poor girls case. It is a very compelling story and will have you on the edge of your seat until the last frame. It isn't like your classic horror movie with special effects taking over and pulling away from the story being told.Linney and Wilkinson are spectacular in their roles  each representing a different side of religion. Even the prosecutor Ethan Thomas  played by Campbell Scott  gives us an interesting look on faith. Wilkinson shows us the extreme faith in God and that the supernatural are the answers for certain things. Linney is more of an middle man in that she says that she has no side to this but learns over time that this girl really had problems of the unknown. Scott's character shows us how a religious man only wants the facts and nothing but the facts. Three mindsets that everyone can put themselves into.The Exorcism of Emily Rose is an intense dramatic thriller that will have you fighting back fear yet overcome with intrigue. Unlike The Exorcist (1973)  this movie delves into the stories controversial aspects with our society and it's religious meaning. It's not your average horror film...that's a good thing...\tAs a Catholic Priest I was VERY interested in this movie! I have never done an exorcism but I know several priests who have. There are lots of good books & articles on real exorcisms available today & I wish somebody would make a film which reflects the successful outcome of most exorcisms. The case of Annelise Michel (Emily Rose) in Germany in 1976 is one of the saddest cases in the past 2000 years. In addition to having severe medical disorders & possibly being tormented by a dark spiritual force  the young girl also starved herself to death ... & her parents & 2 priests allowed her to do so! The film is really about 2 separate but related true stories: 1)Emily's \""possession\"" by a demon 2)Emily's tragic death by self-starvation. The courtroom scenes do a pretty good job of explaining the differences between medical/psychologi"
The Great Raid (2005),"I saw a special screening tonight in Denver  where the director attended and answered questions afterward. As a major history and especially WWII buff  I was excited and happy to gain tickets to the event. But I ended up leaving the theater with a feeling of being disappointed. The actors were decent  but several obviously gained the part(s) not through talent  but for the way that they looked/appearances. The first 2/3 of the movie is slow  with far too much emphasis on a love story than should have been included. The battle scenes are wonderfully done  with great graphics and special effects. But the love story woven in destroys a lot of the movie  and takes attention off of the true story lines and plots  sort of like Pearl Harbor. Overall  I am glad to have seen the movie  but I would have been disappointed and upset if I had spent the 8 bucks on an actual ticket. See if you like  but don't expect too much.\tWhile Hollywood has gone after the Nazis and the European campaign in World War II over and over again  ad nauseam  little has been produced depicting the Pacific Theatre or the thousands of Americans and others who perished there.In fact  only a handful of motion pictures have touched on the subject over the last two decades  namely Steven Spielberg's \Empire of the Sun \"" Terrance Malik's \""The Thin Red Line \"" and the Nicolas Cage bomb  \""Windtalkers.\"" The best film in this genre was probably 1957's \""Bridge On The River Kwai \"" which won Oscars for David Lean and Alex Guinness  among others  but that was almost 50 years ago.Now John Dahl (\""Rounders \"" \""Joyride \"" the TV series \""Tilt\"") has shed some light on a little-known rescue attempt in the waning days of the conflict in the Philippine Islands. \""The Great Raid\"" is a fine little film  smart  patriotic and fairly historically accurate.The film begins with a crisp narration (accompanied by actual film footage) of the quick successes of the Imperial Japanese Army in the days following Pearl Harbor. Gen. Douglas MacArthur - thanks to Roosevelt's decision to devote more to the European effort through the Lend-Lease to Churchill program - is forced to evacuate the Philippines and retreat to Australia.Meanwhile  thousands of American troops are trapped by the swift-moving Japanese forces on the islands of Bataan and Corrigidor and are compelled to surrender. While WWII German brutality is everywhere in motion picture  few have addressed the stark horrors of the Bataan Death March. Even this movie skirts the terror with a simple voice-over in filling in the background story of a group of surviving prisoners held for over three years.Receiving word of mass killing of American POWs by the Japanese  top brass in the Pacific orders a raid on a camp still behind enemy lines  led by Army Ranger Lt. Col. Mucci (Benjamin Bratt  \""Law & Order) and Capt. Prince (James Franco  \""Spiderman \"" \""Spiderman 2\"").Military minutia abounds with the planning and execution of the assault  which pits a handful of rangers against over 200 battle-hardened Japanese troops  led by sadistic Maj. Nagai (Motoki Kobiyashi).The movie also shows the strong relationship between the Americans and Filipinos which was not the greatest in the years after the Spanish-American War  but was cemented against the common Nipponese enemy. Nice composition between rangers  prison camp and the occupied capital of Manilla  where civilian nurse Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielson  \""Gladiator \"" \""One Hour Photo\"")is working with the Filipino underground resistance.This is no \""Saving Private Ryan \"" and the acting sometimes leaves a bit to be desired  but the strength of the story  the fact it was inspired by true events  and the historical importance of the film  make this one a must-see  even for casual fans of the genre. It will not make much money  but it was very important that it was made.\tRead  \""Ghost Soldiers \"" before you watch the movie. It's the best book I've ever read. If you can read it without crying  then you don't have a soul. If the movie was done right  it will have the same effect. Some critics have complained that the movie has too much drama and not enough action. But you can't really set up the story without seeing the background. The book has it all. The Death March  the imprisonment  people dying every day of malnutrition and disease. When you finally get to the end and the attack takes place  all that drama will lead into  if the movie was done correctly  one of the most climactic endings in the history of cinematography. Period. Action movies are a dime a dozen. These POW's waited for years for even the smallest glimmer of hope. What little hope they did receive  in the form of Red Cross care packages  were pillaged by the Japanese before making their way to the POW's. Their world was bleak and hopeless. How can we expect to understand the frustration and gradual loss of hope they felt if we don't have ample time to understand their suffering? If this movie portrays the anguish  despair  and finally the redemption as well as the book does  it will absolutely be nominated for every award they can come up with. But that's a big  \""if.\"" The movie has the potential to redefine the word  \""hero \"" not only in the way we associate the word with movies  but in the way we apply it to real life. That just cannot be accomplished in the average 90 minute action film. If you want nonstop action  watch Predator (which I do really like  by the way.) If the movie is going to give us any appreciation at all for the horror these POW's endured  if it's intent is to give us even the vaguest idea how important this raid was to the POW's and their families  then without question it needs to be long and full of drama. The ending will take care of itself.\tI saw a preview in Michigan  last Monday. I liked the love story. As mentioned in the former comment  the graphics  scenery  etc. were excellent. I thought the actors were great. I especially liked the music; I thought it matched the movie well. The movie was realistic  profound and inspiring; I was impressed. Additionally  my fianc\u00e9 (who has a degree in history)  his sister  and my brother  also thought the movie was exceptional. The director was there after the showing I went to as well  and one thing that stands out that he said was that war veterans  in general  are reluctant to tell about themselves and their heroics  as they felt that they were simply doing their duty. Especially after seeing the movie  I think it is even more important for war veterans and heroes alike  to come forward with their extraordinary stories  to inspire us all  and to remind us that there are honorable people out there. Thank you to everyone who has served our country!\tI knew almost nothing of this film before I saw it but based on a couple comments I had heard  I went with my dad to see it tonight.Some people commented on how slow the movie is during the beginning  and although that is true  it is there to give you time to develop a story and actual care about the characters. This is definitely not a movie for people with near zero attention spans from the MTV Generation.This movie also doesn't rely on gimmicks such as CGI or what I call \""shaky camera syndrome\"" where the filmmakers insist on making the audience nauseous by running around with handy-cams (ala Bourne Supremacy).I really enjoyed the story and thought all the roles were well acted. The final raid scene is amazing. They did a really good job of explaining exactly what they wanted to do beforehand and when it actually happened  you understood where everyone was running to and what they were trying to accomplish.Excellent movie  and highly recommended. Definitely one of the best movies so far of the year  I'm just sad that almost no one has heard about it and the movie has received so little promotion. I doubt this picture will even make $20 million here.And one more thing  I thought it was a very tasteful and respectful thing to do at the end during the credits where they showed archival footage of the real soldiers being rescued.\tI'd have liked this movie more had it focused on the tremendous mission  rather than the prisoners. As such  I found it to drag.I don't need to see atrocities by the Japanese six times to know that they are the bad guys here. Okay  I get it already.The action scenes are great  but only for the six or seven minutes they are on screen. Had it been more about the great difficulties and dangers that those rescuers overcame  I'd have been more immersed. After all  it was called the Great RAID  not the Great Imprisonment  and so I had that expectation.So a little less Schindler's List / Papillon was needed. You can't make a movie in the vein this wanted to be without forcing comparisons to those two classics  and this movie is not engaging in that capacity. It needed a little more Band of Brothers.The fictionalized love interest to me didn't belong in a true story. In fact  the entire resolution of that plot line was unfulfilling and a letdown. I could be wrong about its veracity but it seemed like they took some facts and tried to mold it into that part of the story... please leave that for Sightings on the Sci-Fi Channel. Stick to what really happened.Indeed  every part of the movie that was true was exciting. Every part they had to make up was trite or boring.\tCritics had carped about the dialog and pacing of this movie but I think they were wrong. This was a faithful adaptation of the book 'Ghost Soldiers'  with first rate acting and outstanding action sequences. When the movie ended  original news reel footage was run with the actual POW survivors while the credits rolled. Nobody left the theater until this had ended. I liked it better than 'Saving Private Ryan'. A true story about true heroes  unlike so many Hollywood produced war movies that are written to please focus groups. I would recommend this movie to anyone with an interest in American history as it is accurately and movingly portrayed on film.\tI saw this film at the Montreal premier last week with my father in law who is a WW II U.S. Navy veteran. During the warm-up  the MC asked if there were any vets in the audience. My f.i.l. raised his hand and was awarded the book on which the film is based (Ghost Soldiers). As he is visually impaired  he gave me the book to read. And read I did! I finished it off by the next day. As I said  it is a good movie  but it is indeed based on a great book and shows the terrible horror the POW's were subjected to. I do recommend to any to go see this film and then after get the book and read the truth about how and what really happened. By the way  Japan never apologized for the maltreatment to the soldiers nor to the civilians tortured during the war.\tIt was both great entertainment and great historical lesson too. Even though I knew the outcome of the raid  I was enthralled with the story's tension and plot. (Much like in Ron Howard's  \""Apollo 13\"" movie) The love interest of the story was fictional  but did not take away from the power of the true story  it enhanced it. The musical score added a touch of reverence and respect to the movie  similar to the musical score in \""Saving Private Ryan\""  \""Band of Brothers\"" and \""We were Soldiers Once\"". I especially loved the transition between B/W and color.As far as historical lesson goes - well done. I especially loved the actual footage at the end of the movie. Showing the photos and movies with the real people  and short synopsis of the raid's statistics  and footage that showed the rescued POW's return trip home - from beginning to end was magnificent. My only wish was a little more information of the what became of the actual characters featured in the film.I plan to buy the DVD when it is released.\tIf you like watching the history channel like I do you 'The Great Raid' is the summer movie for you. Not a flaw in The great raid. Directed and acted well. The script follows the historical and personal stories well. Movie is better than Pearl Harbor. The acting schools are better than years ago  and shows that no film needs a 9 million dollar actor which kills the budget  with cheap sets  and no script rewrite. Many years ago the need for name actors helped. Some of the no name actors do better films and acting  while the Julia Roberts  and Tom Cruises live on past glories and have been in disappointing films  with tired roles. Nice to not see all the computer animation in a film for a change  which is getting old. 9 or 10 out of 10. Nice to see a film which tells the story like it is. Not have all the Hollywood made up baloney. I rather watch the Duke if the film is fictitious. Good movie\tThis is a really well written  directed and acted war movie. I wish it had been filmed in real  natural color  not the grey overtone to make it look like it was filmed during WW II.Everything about it is great except the photography. The cinemaphotographer tried to create the same effect in \""Sky Captian  World of Tomorrow\"" with Jude Law. This greyed out effect is unnatural and detracts from the overall quality of the film. There is nothing wrong with depicting real color  rather than cheapening it to look like a lesser quality film was used. There is some archive footage that was undoubtedly filmed during the war and is black & white. That's fine  but modern film doesn't need to be made to look like it's lower quality film.The war scenes are very realistic. The film is a great depiction of the underground activity in Manila  as well as realistic scenes from the POW camp. The rescue operation is suspenseful and detailed. GREAT STORY!!! 9/10\tmuch about the war in the Pacific. With all of the recent 60 year commemorations marking the end of World War II  it was hard to avoid the documentaries on the History channel  the military channel  etc....the Bataan Death March is something I only recently heard about - I don't think I even learned about it when I was in school. I really did not know what to expect when I walked into the theater - I was blown away. Thank you to all who worked and made this film  it is such an important piece of American history  you all should be so proud! I have promised myself to read more about WWII - especially the war in the Pacific and what happened during the Great Raid.\tThe classic World War II POW film is \""Stalag 17\"" and now \""The Great Raid\"" can join those ranks. Movie audiences have had many examples of war-torn European cities so it is significant to complete that visual history with pictures of wartime Manila. Presenting the role of the Filipino guerrillas and underground network playing their crucial role in the war also makes history more complete. Great care was taken with the cinematography that gives a feel for the historical period with sepia tones. I appreciated the fact that this film was not used as a vehicle for a Hollywood celebrity's career nor used as mindless entertainment  like empty calories. I was surprised to find out later how long the movie actually was because it didn't seem that long; it was well paced  always filled with something interesting -- story-wise and visually. My Filipino uncles were guerrillas who fought in that war  survived the Bataan Death March  and they were realistically presented -- finally! Now hopefully  the world will give Filipino World War II veterans their rightful recognition AND coincidently  return veterans' benefits which the U.S. Congress denied or reneged on immediately after World War II. Because even though they fought under the U.S. flag and U.S. military leadership  Filipino World War II veterans were treated unjustly when it came to getting medical treatment at U.S. military veterans hospitals and the other usual veterans benefits (pensions  etc.). These veterans and their advocates and Filipino community activists have held protest demonstrations and presented legislation to Congress to have their veterans benefits restored. This movie shows why they deserve it!\tMy wife & I saw the movie on opening weekend. We don't go to the movies very often any more  because most of what is produced is garbage. This was a fast-moving  dramatic movie. It is on par with \""Saving Private Ryan\""  \""Band of Brothers\""  and \""The Longest Day\"". It was refreshing  and a great relief  to see a movie that portrayed Americans as heroes  instead of \""the bad guys\"". It was not concerned about portraying the Japanese as the enemy. This is not a \""politically correct\"" movie (maybe that's why the reviews have not been 4 stars). I noticed a few seniors in the theater  and wondered  since I'm in a military retirement town  if any had participated in this \""Great Raid\"". The Pacific Theatre has not received as much recognition as the war in Europe. I rarely purchase DVDs  but this is one I intend to buy  and watch again and again. In short  GO SEE THIS MOVIE.\tThere are some strange things about this film that nobody seems to have noticed. But before delving into them probably this should be said: to a certain extent it is a throwback to way films used to be made  separating itself from the host of films done the last few years. First of all it is a rah rah picture  not so different from the host of world war two propaganda pictures. It seems to me a more realistic picture  although also nodding towards the rah rah a little was something like Objective Burma. Errol Flynn's captain under the direction of Walsh was the more enjoyable performance.Somebody mentioned the music as being fine. Not to me. Actually for years now music in films has been so over-hyped and pounding it is bothersome  this film could have been done with a lot less of that. And as for realism  well to have not one soldier use the F word  to anybody in the service  is fantasyland. Not that I missed it. Glad I didn't have to listen to a lot of swearing  but I had the feeling that Dahl was doing it out of some strange respect to the actual very brave men who made the raid.Even so  the Raid was fairly well done  but for me the most gripping scenes were with the nurse. And Manila had a very nice feel to it.All in all no more than a five for this  but I am glad it was made as a reminder of just how price was paid by the men of world war two. And compared to the junk that is made anymore  its a classic.\tIt is an amazing true story  that deserved better than this. There were two major things that detracted from the movie: 1. Freshly pressed  new-looking US uniforms (the actual documentary footage from the raid & photos showed the US soldiers haggard from their trip through the jungle. Yet in the movie  they look like they just walked out of a wardrobe trailer) 2. Incorrect Japanese uniforms (Army officer's rank insignia was upside down!) Not to mention the Japanese camp guards wearing Rugby shirts. I laughed when I saw the Japanese tanker wearing a wide brimmed pith helmet with US flight goggles. He looked more like some kind of warped \""Afrika Korps\"" soldier. Who did the military research?! Why weren't the Japanese tanker crews wearing tanker helmets? Or even the standard combat cap? Doesn't anyone watch the History Channel anymore? Overall  the film felt like a 1960's era episode of \""Combat\"" with cheesy scenarios. The nighttime running-battle between the \""good guy\"" and \""bad guy\"" was cartoonish! - - - - - Too bad  because it is an amazing story that deserved WAY better.\tThe Great Raid ----- August 12  2005  a review by Teresita \""Terry\"" BautistaBerkeley  CA \u0096 In the near-empty Shattuck Cinema  I gave myself the birthday gift of watching The Great Raid on opening night. This film  a chronicle of early 1945 events in The Philippines  has been highly anticipated in the U.S. Filipino Community  mostly by those of us who are fighting to achieve full equity for our Veteranos. My mom  aunt and uncle joined me  as the initial documentary footage validated the historical scenes of war and resistance  as if you were there over 60 years ago. As expected  my mom made constant commentary throughout the film  as the scenes brought back  often frightening  memories. Anxiously  she recounted in soft whispers of her bout with malaria  which meant sure death  until her father decided she would not be left behind  as they ran every day to escape the Japanese. Like the film's prisoner of war  quinine was the saving prescription for my mom's malaria-stricken body.The Great Raid is an army flick  similar to the scores I've seen in the past 50 years. Less melodramatic  though powerful in its interpretation of the human condition during war  the movie takes you into a POW camp where 500 detainees eke out survival under the Japanese flag. The acting was understated and reflected deep agony and despair without the flair of cinema-edged bravado. No John Waynes or Anthony Quinns in this version. The casting was done with a sense of nuance for each of the heroic personas.The subplots were gripping. The valiant efforts of the underground that smuggled medicine to the ill and dying prisoners; the array of authority figures in the military who made heart-rending decisions about strategy and tactics; the rescue mission that galvanized a unit of 120 special rangers who had yet to see the extreme fires of combat; the unlikely relationships that bound survivors in their fate.Some high points of the painful  two and a half- hour mendacity tensed you to the edge of your seat ----- the brutality of the Japanese  not withstanding the execution of ten prisoners for one escapee; the burning funeral of a hundred Filipinos  many of them women and children villagers  near the Cabanatuan Prison; the spectacular  surprise invasion of the Japanese camp; the courage of the Filipino Guerrilas and their exemplary warrior spirits led by Captain Pajota  as their steeled defense of a bridge held the Japanese and their tanks captive and effectively severed an avenue of retaliations to the explosions and attack in their war camp. The sacrifices of the fighting forces to liberate the Philippines were stark and many. The younger generations  especially those of Filipino descent  are urged to see what their homeland heroes were made of. This long war was waged in face-to-face  hand-to-hand combat with bravery for duty and beyond.I went to see this as a way of honoring my dad  a U.S. Army private  who survived WWII  found his war bride  and fathered his first-born. I have deep respect and admiration for those like my Pop  who still live to tell their stories  who today are still struggling for full recognition of shed blood  sweat  and tears  at a time where their homeland joined the world's battlefields. WWII Filipino Veterans soldiers deserve Full Equity Now!####\tAn excellent movie depicting a REAL event. A well portrayed war yarn that is not over the top. This is the way movies should be made. John Dahl did a great job as did the entire cast. If you are looking for Spielberg  Hanks  Dsvid Lean  or big dollar CG this movie is not for you. If you are interested in a SOLID film based on a overlooked war even this movie will definitely satisfy. Let's face it there are very few war films made these days and this one is TOPS. Henry Mucci's character as well as the 6th Rangers preparation for the raid could have been better developed but the overall depictation of this historic event is well done.\tThe Great Raid has a beginning  a middle and an end. Tightly scripted and well acted by all concerned. A well turned look at a military action that was forgotten and only remembered by those who's lives were changed on that day. It's poor reception by critics is a puzzle and why it sat in the can for three years is an unknown. The rangers and the American POWs are the heroes in this movie. The action is stark and without pity although the \""love\"" story was a slight distraction but the intent was to show that for many Filipinos  the American POWs were not forgotten and would be helped even though the Japanese response was normally brutal and without mercy. The audience that viewed the picture with my wife and I were mostly older military retirees and many cried at what was being showed. Most stayed until all the movie credits were completed  something one normally doesn't see. This is a must see movie because the raid was true and this movie depicts it well. The 500 US POWs freed by this raid had been forgotten by all except the 6th Ranger Bn. Howaa.\tI just watched The Great Raid in the theater in this afternoon. I couldn't be more touched by the story  and the movie confirmed my respect to the American troops for their contribution and sacrifice. I am a Chinese. In China  we were taught to remember the horrible atrocity that Japanese army committed to us during their mass invasion into China in WWII. However the Communist Party claimed that they were the liberator of Chinese people and Americans joined the war because they just wanted to benefit from the war by selling weapons and taking control. After I came to America  I learned and heard more stories about WWII. Not long  I realized that that was a despicable lie. It was Americans that made the greatest sacrifice of lives and blood  saved us from being slaves and brought the peace to us. Without American troops fighting against Japanese and Germans  no nation could ever take them out from our map and nobody could imagine how long we had to be slaves for them. Americans gained nothing but greatest honor from the people around world for their engaging in WWII. Nowadays  the United States have possessed the most powerful military force and political influence in the world. I hope that today's young Americans remember their WWII heroes as much as we do  they will continue to stand for liberty  justice  humanity and freedom in front of the world  just like their grandfathers!"""
The Grudge (2004),"This movie is very good looking. The 'ghosts' are extremely creepy looking and the sound effects are horrifying. Everything a good horror movie needs you might say. Well  not exactly  unfortunately the movie also suffers from some bad storytelling and a 'scare' overdose that take away a lot of the movie its tension and scary moments. It makes \The Grudge\"" a good looking but lacking horror movie  that perhaps still has more goods as bads but still remains a bit of a disappointing movie with lots of missed opportunities.Problem is that they basically tried to put a scary moment in literally almost every scene. I don't know why but after a while some of the scene's loose their power to scare you. Maybe its because you get used to the atmosphere and the scare moments of the movie  or something like that. Instead of making the movie scary it made the movie predictable and too much of the same the whole time.The movie its story is told in a completely illogically way. the time-line is very messy  it jumps from the present to what happened a few hours or days or years before to some totally different characters. It's not that it becomes difficult to follow but it's just that it feels pointless and unneeded that the story is told in that particular way. It also distracts from the main story line and the main character played by the boring and untalented acting Sarah Michelle Gellar. As a matter of fact  the story is told in such a way that the main character is perhaps only on screen for 50% of its running time  at the most.Big plus of me was Ted Raimi in a typical Ted Raimi role. His more famous brother Sam was one of the producers of the movie. Too bad Sam Raimi didn't directed this  I'm sure he would had made something more of this movie.It's all too bad  cause \""The Grudge\"" is a well made movie that had lots of potential to become just as good as the other Japenese horror movie remake \""The Ring\"". The movie however heavily suffers from the makers ambition to make this the ultimate scary movie. You might say that this movie died of a scare overdose.Still of course the movie still remain perfectly watchable thanks to the visual look of it and some nice sequences.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/\tThe only things that made this worth watching were the scenes of what I presume was Tokyo. Of course  my comments are probably irrelevant since I am not attracted to horror films. I realize the director also wrote and directed the original version in Japanese. I am not impressed. John Carpenter's \""Halloween\""...now  THERE was a horror flick that had legs.The acting was awful; the main character (the nurse)is insipid and has about three facial expressions: smiling  bewildered  aghast. The scary faces are pretty good  and the bodies are artfully rendered. However  the tension was lackluster. The explanation is idiotic. The inconclusive ending is just stupid. I watched this because someone recommended it -- he kept telling me how great it was. Hmm.\tAfter seeing \""ju-on\"" i really get disappointed  why?  because is really weird and is not even scary. The i really was specking \""the grudge\""  and i went to see the movie in the opening day  i was really scared  this version is very creepy  Sarah Michelle Gellar is amazing on this film  her character is original  but that's not everything  the ghost of the movie is the best part  the kid it was not scary  in fact it was really insignificant  but the mother  Kayako was very  very creepy  the best  just seeing the beginning of the film and you already can't sleep in night.A very good horror film  much better than the ring  with a lot of spooky scenes  specially the bed sequence  you' re not gonna forget that  believe me.8/10\tThe movie has a very \""convienient\"" plot that automatically allows everything that happens in it to make no sense whatsoever. Sure  you don't expect a masterpiece story line in a horror movie  but come on  this one sounds like a very bad ghost story you would laugh at by the camp fire. So basically what you have here is a pile of supposedly creepy scenes consisting of worn out images of zombie looking children  cats  something that looks like hair i suppose it was  you have some burping and meowing sound effects to amplify the level of senselessness. I guess the makers assumed it would be scary since people are supposed to be scared what they don't understand and rationally explain. Well  not here. Yes I admit  some moments might creep you out on occasion  but it becomes obvious quite quickly that the extremely poor plot is just a cheap excuse to put a bunch creepy images in the movie. Nope  doesn't work  because what perfectly backs up creepy visuals  is the creepy story. But I guess we couldn't have both.I don't know. Maybe I'm too demanding. Maybe a bit of effort is too much to ask these days. Maybe I've been playing too much Silent Hill (because that  although not a movie  is a perfect combination of extremely creepy story and creepy images  and the 'fear of the unexplained' theory works perfectly there).Not a good movie. I'll give it 3 burping zombie girls up.\tThe Grudge is a very disappointing movie. I'm not going to beat around the bush  I didn't care for a single thing this film had to offer. Well except for.... well I'm not going to spoil anything for you. The picture is so close in feel and look of \""The Ring\"" that it's almost laughable  and in the end it isn't anything close to as original and terrifying as \""The Ring\"" was. This is just kind of a hunk of fall crap  that scores it's screams and scares from merely cheap shots. But the cheap shots aren't what really frustrates me about \""The Grudge\""  it's the fact that they never explain what is going on and more importantly why. The filmmaker spends so much time flashing weird circus crap in front of you  that he forgets to add in an actual reason why all the supernatural events are happening. There are enough unfinished and unexplained events that take place in The Grudge to fill up a 500 page novel. The acting is nothing to shout from the hilltops with glee about either. Sarah Michelle Gellar phones in her performance like she's ordering a pizza  and the actor who plays the detective investigating the horror of the Grudge is in desperate need of a career change. Maybe he should try working at McDonalds instead of acting. The only decent acting we come in counter with during the entire span of the film is from Bill Pullman  who's in the film for only the first two minutes. In conclusion  The Grudge runs for 96 minutes  but if you ask me it seems like 96 days. I've never been so anxious in my life to get out of the theater and finish up my homework at home then I was when I went to see The Grudge. Don't waste your time or money on The Grudge. Time is better spent picking fluff out of your navel  then going to see Takashi Shimizu's latest travesty. Grade: D (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30  Phoenix  Arizona  10/23/04)my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece  near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces).\tThis film is AMAZINGLY SCARY. The man who made this film should have an award for scariest film. This film isn't something you should watch with people with heart problem because  sorry to say but they gonna have a heart attack. Sarah Michelle Gellar is amazing in this film she is the best actress I've seen in a horror movie.This film is about a woman and a boy that have died and there spirits have stayed angry in a house that you don't want to go in  because if you do YOU DEAD. You should see this if your up for a scare. There's heart pounding jump scenes in this film. Brilliant gore and murder that you need to watch. 10/10 you must see this film. To the director i thank you for this film.\tI made the BIG mistake  i bought this movie  first week it was released \u00a315.99 and if i could turn back the clock  I WOULD! it was awesomely terrible to say the least.If your after a good remake of a Japanese horror  LOOK FURTHER  and buy the Ring  Naomi Watts.This movie was so poor to say the least  i was hoping to see better from Sarah Michelle Gellar  Lovely looking minx but she was so poor  the whole direction this movie took went from bad to worst. On a good point about the movie it would have to be the Gorgeous looks of KaDee Strickland  but her part was way to short.\tTo be honest  The Grudge  in my opinion is a fantastic film. The way it is written and the settings and the actors  everything about it is good. The girl that plays the actual 'grudge ghost' is brilliant. She looks amazing and does the whole thing really well. From what I can gather  the director is a brilliant director. It's not really gory and I suppose some people might find it quite scary but I didn't. I'm completely stunned by the film and I've become obsessed with learning Japanese language and doing other Japanese stuff. I think maybe Sarah Michelle Geller kind of spoils it a bit but only slightly. I guess its because every time you see Sarah Michelle Geller you stereotype her as Buffy and therefore cant imagine seeing her in anything else. All in all its a great movie. No hang ups about it. ITS A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!\tI've had some friends of mine argue that the Japanese version of the Ring (Ringu  I think) was much better to the two that have been made here. I loved the Grudge  I thought it was terrifying (although I couldn't keep from thinking of Sarah Michelle Geller as Buffy...). In this movie  I actually screamed  and I have never screamed in a movie theater in my life. I actually had claw marks from my best friend grabbing my arm in the middle of the movie. If you've seen it  you know it tends to have that kind of effect when you watch it for the first time. But I've heard that the Japanese version is better...is this true?\tOK i have read a lot of comments/reviews on this movie and i know a lot of people that didn't like it didn't understand it. I understood it but still...it sucked! Mainly for 2 reasons number 1 nothing was scary. The commercial made it look terrifying the worst part was the noise and it was only scary the first time you hear it (scary eh more like unexpected). After that its more like just annoying.Number 2 its predictability. I knew what was going to happen at least 5 minutes before it did! For those who couldn't figure out why Bill Pullman committed suicide then i suggest watching it again cause that was definitely explained!\tI am just writing this because I believe this movie is underrated. I found it to be very scary  with an interesting story and good actors. Maybe some people want to see see body parts flying all over all the time  OK  this film is more subtle. Not much gore  but menace. Of course you will find plot holes if you look for them but which film does not have them? I recommend everybody to give this film a fair chance; I am not easily scared but this film freaked me out. Adding a few words to fill the ten lines required Adding a few words to fill the ten lines required9/10.\tThis movie really had potential. I had two big problems with it. First  it moved just a tad too slow. There is something to be said for not trucking along  but every scene included too much of people moving at snail speed  breathing heavily  waiting for the next scary moment. I did think it was interesting how it did not follow a chronological timeline. The second aspect that I did not like was how everyone kept getting suckered into the same stupid scary movie mistakes. In my opinion a well done scary movie should be one that has people doing realistic things.Spoilers below: 1. In the part where the detective went to burn the house  he should have known better by that point not to investigate any weird noises.2. Susan was stupid to go to her apartment and be alone. She should have gone somewhere where she would not be alone.Anyways  I could list a million of these. I finished that movie completely upset.\tThe ambiance is there  and the movie does offer some good scares  but all in all it is flat and uneven. There are some great performances  Kadee Strickland's Susan stands out  but overall the movie doesn't offer enough backdrop in the characters' lives to actually care about them. Sarah Michelle Gellar is a good scream queen  and poised to take the title away from Jamie Lee Curtis any year now  after all she stole the spotlight in I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scream 2. In the end  I felt ripped off of a story  there seems to be no story what-so-ever and the thought of getting a sequel on the way is just stupid  it didn't work for The Ring (which was actually one of the best horror movies to come out of the last decade) why should it work for a knock off?\tKaren(Sarah Michelle Gellar) is a nurse working in Tokyo  Japan who gets involved in a raging curse at a haunted house.The movie is absolute garbage(as I said in the title). It wasn't scary  exciting  interesting  or thrilling. It is funny at times but only because it is so stupid! I still don't understand why the kid made a \""meow\"" noise. I don't understand the black stuff that would spread on to the roof  even after watching the whole move. The acting was horrible and unconvincing. Sarah Michelle Gellar's acting was a joke. Come to think of it  everything in this movie was a joke. One big joke!! Overall  the movie was horrible. That's it! Horrible! I do not recommend this movie.\tI liked this movie  because  unlike most horror movies  it does not emphasize on gore. One does not see perhaps any act of killing by the ghosts  while it's in progress. Instead the sound effect does that job in this movie.Also  the movie moves back and forth and leaves things unspoken and aspects unexplained  which is a good thing to me! This movie basically exploits the scare on the face of  and in the heart  of the characters  which successfully affects the viewer.However  the standard of acting by the principal character is  at best  of porn star/movie quality. Actually  I spent the first half an hour (after her appearance) thinking in which adult movie had I seen her earlier! Then I remembered that it was the movie entitled \""Nymph Fever\""  where a \""scientist\"" with apparently  at least  36DDD pair of silicone  looked  talked and acted almost exactly like our leading lady here. Sadly  our heroine neither seems to have 36DDD  nor any trace of acting capabilities.Also the movie is heavy with major logical flaws. For example  no human being would return alone to a house (in spite of being fully aware that the house is haunted) at night for whatever reason; but this movie has such a scene in it. That is absolutely absurd  and defies all logic!!\tI think I have seen just about every Horror  scary  ghosty  witchy movie that has ever been made - and this one was definitely the worst. I guess the only thing needed to scare today's audiences is properly placed music blasts and creepy faces. The story line was choppy to say the least. And - oh my! Bill Pullman  I adore you - WHATEVER are you doing in a loser like this one???? The only \""Grudge\"" I could see was punishment from the director. And the critics must have had a grudge against this one. If it had been possible to vote a \""zero\"" on this one  I would have. Please folks - don't waste your time on this movie - there are so many other scary movies that are both scary and interesting.\tThis is quite simply some of the freakiest stuff i have ever seen in my life  with an amazing performance from Sarah Michelle Gellar!. All the characters are fantastic  and i thought those weird noises were very frightening  plus Sarah Michelle Gellar is simply amazing in this!. This is my 2nd viewing after 1st having seeing it in theaters  it frightened me to death  and i started to panic  upon 2nd viewing it wasn't quite as scary  however it still scared the crap out of me  and i found the score pretty creepy as well  plus i thought Gellar and Jason Behr had very good chemistry together. The plot is hard to follow at times  as your wondering what the hell is going on  however it explains itself pretty good at the end in my opinion  plus the people who are calling this funny  are absolutely messed up in the head. It relies on a lot of jump scares  and boy do they ever work  and i thought the makeup effects were great  plus the ending was awesome!  and paves way for a sequel  and one of my favorite scenes is when KaDee Strickland's character Susan looks under the sheet  and has a surprise waiting for her. This is simply some of the freakiest stuff i have ever seen in my life  with an amazing performance from Michelle Gellar  and i say go see it immediately!. The Direction is wonderful!. Takashi Shimizu does a wonderful job here  with amazing camera work  fantastic angles  constantly adding scary images  and very scary atmosphere  and doing a great job on making us the viewers scared (in my opinion)!. There isn't much gore. except a severed jaw  grotesque faces  blood here and there  a graphic fall victim  and other minor stuff. The Acting is fantastic!. Sarah Michelle Gellar is AMAZING as always  and is amazing here  she is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS!  fantastic in the acting department  was vulnerable  had very good chemistry with Jason Behr  wa s very caring  and proved she can carry a lead role like a champ!  i loved her! as usual (Gellar Rules!!!). Jason Behr is very likable  and id what he had to do very well  he had very good chemistry with Gellar  and just did a great job. William Mapother is okay here as Matthew and did his job adequately. Clea DuVall is so so here  i am not a big fan of hers  so i wasn't really a fan of her in this one either  she did OK i guess. KaDee Strickland is hot and shows up to collect a paycheck and that's pretty much it. Bill Pullman is fantastic here  he looked awesome  and was just too cool  wished he had more screen time though!.Ted Raimi has a small role here and he did good. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall Go see it immediately it's some of the freakiest stuff i have ever seen! Ju On is next! i can't wait. ***** out of 5\tThe review by Togasaurus I think describes this movies structure and intent best. Americans look for ghosts (spirits) who have a reason for being  an intent  a location and a resolution. On the other hand  the Japanese believe in a more basic animism. The spirit is independent of the person who died and exists as the embodiment of an emotion - in this case rage. The spirits and the atmosphere in which they are revealed is done excellently - but there is no motivation or resolution. They are rage. They are not limited to a location  but can manifest anywhere where the victims happen to be. Supposedly  they pass their rage on to their victims. Their victims then die and new rage spirits are born. The spirits  at least in this movie  are not banished or exorcised. They continue to exist and continue to kill. Most of this is not communicated in The Grudge. You either know the culture or you do not. From what I was reading I guess this rage was passed on to most Americans who saw this movie. Watching The Grudge I felt like I was on the verge of really liking this movie  but was lacking the necessary understanding to do so - a strange feeling. Anyway  this is worth a watch on cable or DVD.\tJust finished watching \""The Grudge\"" and unfortunately I didn't find it to be particularly engaging. Perhaps it was the slow pace  or the lack of coherent plot. Unfortunately horror films usually do lose me when people starting pursuing the ghost (or spirit) into dark places alone -- I guess I'm too logical.It was beautifully filmed and the music was a nice addition  but I found myself audibly sighing repeatedly during the movie (luckily I was in my living room). Probably because it seemed like the same scene over and over again.Obviously there are people with a much bigger appreciation for this type of film than I do. If you are somebody who thought the Ring was fabulous then you'll probably like this. If not  you might find this film a little tedious and repetitive.\tThe basis behind The Grudge is that there's a Japanese myth that when a person dies (typically murder or some type of passionate context)  a curse exists in that space that continues to haunt anyone who gets involved. This curse follows the individual until they die.The Grudge is supposedly made shot for shot with the Japense version. To jump to my summary  the film does a terrific job in building suspense and making you feel incredibly uneasy. The sound effects are great! While the plot doesn't make entirely too much sense  it's believable  for the moment.Karen (a very convincing Sarah Michelle Gellar  I'm no Buffy fan) is a transplant to Japan. She lives there with her boyfriend. Karen attends a local university and does community work for experience. Her work is helping housebound elders. Karen helps an elderly woman who is frightened by a mysterious force (the curse). The backstory unfolds  about the house  that involves a Professor (Bill Pullman) who is indirectly involved in a death. The movie does a lot of flashbacks but is effective.Not as good as The Ring but worth a DVD rental."""
The High and the Mighty (1954),"It's a long way from Honolulu to San Francisco in a DC-4. Will a troubled plane with a cabin filled with troubled people make it? Like the actual flight  this movie is VERY long and mostly VERY boring. I recommend paying attention to the boarding procedures (Hawaii wasn't a state when this movie was made  and this is way  way before 9/11)  and then  once aboard  take a nap or try a little remote control time travel to get to the \oh my God  are they going to make it or not\"" ending.I'm an aviation nut. The airplane  airport  control tower and center shots are now vintage stuff. The depictions of Oakland Center didn't show a single radar scope--which makes sense for the time. The discussions of early 1950's navigation are also great from an aviation history point of view. Ernest K. Gann  the author of the book on which the movie is based  also wrote the screenplay for the movie. He was an airline pilot during the golden age of Air Transport  so you'd expect a realistic story; but  other than the last 15 or so minutes of the movie  there is very little action.I remember thinking during the early part of the movie that there sure were a lot of petty little people with a bunch of petty little problems. (I later checked the book out from my local library and  much to my horror  discovered that the book too introduced a bunch of petty little people with a bunch of petty little problems. I never made it through the book.) \u0085but the movie  well  the last fifteen minutes of the movie just about make up for everything else.The last fifteen minutes tell you everything you need to know . . . that co-pilot John Wayne had some \""bad luck\"" in South America  but that when the going gets tough  John Wayne (what a surprise) is the man you want in the cockpit. Of course  the going DOES get tough  and John Wayne has to slap pilot Robert Stack into shape  just like Robert Stack sort of has to slap Robert Hayes into shape (over the Radio) in \""Airplane.\"" (In fact  the slapping scene that takes place in the passenger cabin of the 707 in \""Airplane\"" is a perfect parody of John Wayne slapping Robert Stack in the cockpit of their DC-4. Also  \""Airplane's\"" flight attendant blowing air into an inflatable auto pilot is a great parody of \""Miss Spalding\"" using her mouth to gently inflate a \""Mae West\"" on a young passenger in \""The High and the Mighty.\"") \""Airplane\"" is a great movie  but if you haven't seen \""The High and the Mighty \"" you might not realize that \""Airplane\"" is just one continuous spoof of the horrors that afflicted the people and planes that Ernest Gann wrote about. \""The High and the Mighty \"" \""The Crowded Skies \"" and \""Fate is the Hunter\"" were all books/movies that \""Airplane\"" poked fun at.I usually imagine John Wayne riding off into the sunset at the end of a movie  but at the end of \""The High and the Mighty\"" he disappears into the fog  whistling a tune that will stay with you for the rest of your life.WHAT AN ENDING!!!\tThis movie is so bad it is actually entertaining. I gave it a 2 rather that a 1 because it is amusing.The \""Airplane\"" movies are supposed to be based on this clunker and I can see why. I won't make any comments about the cardboard characters  corny situations  and painfully unreal dialog  as it has been said better elsewhere in these reviews.I'll just give you a challenge: Watch \""The High and the Mighty\"" after you watch \""Airplane\"" and try not to laugh.Some Box Office hits wear well over time. Unfortunately  this is not one of them.\tI saw this movie years ago (I think it was on CBS in 1979 when John Wayne died) and the only thing I remembered was when Wayne slapped Robert Stack. Sadly  it hasn't held up. And this film being one of the inspirations for \""Airplane\"" didn't help - I kept laughing at dialogue that wasn't supposed to be funny! Yes  the film score is memorable and the movie is beautifully shot  but this is one planeload of cardboard characters  stitched together with cornball flashbacks and unintentionally hilarious voice-overs (Stack's rambling inner monologue makes you wonder what he's been smoking). There is  however  one really good moment - Jan Sterling's \""makeup\"" scene. That was very well done  and Sterling really held my attention. Would that the rest of the movie had been as good. I also liked the 50s depiction of air travel - men in suits  women in jewelry and everybody brandishing cigarettes. But that's about all I can recommend. Sorry  John Wayne fans.\t\""The High and the Mighty\""  the granddaddy of air disaster movies  often falls into almost campy melodrama  but under the direction of the legendary 'Wild Bill' Wellman  and punctuated by one of Dimitri Tiomkin's most bombastic yet exciting scores (earning him an Oscar)  the film maintains such a level of intensity that it remains constantly entertaining. With John Wayne heading an ensemble cast (including several co-stars from the past  as well as personal friends)  it is certainly an essential for any 'Duke' film library.Produced by Wayne-Fellows Productions  and 'owned'  eventually  by the Wayne family's Batjac Productions (along with \""Hondo\""  \""McLintock!\""  and \""Island in the Sky\"")  the film was a BIG hit  when released  and offered one of Wayne's better performances  then gained even greater stature as it was unseen for a generation. I've always held the belief that the family planned to release the entire quartet of films in 2007  to mark the centennial of Duke's birth  but two events changed the plan; first  an unauthorized  'remixed' VHS version of \""McLintock!\"" was released  with rumors that a version of \""Hondo\"" was also in the works  forcing Michael Wayne  then President of Batjac  to release authorized VHS versions of the two films  rather than have the market glutted with bad copies; second  with Michael's death  in 2003  the Wayne family rethought the master plan  deciding to release the entire collection on DVD earlier. For whatever reason  seeing \""The High and the Mighty\"" again is a cause to celebrate! Based on Ernest K. Gann's bestseller (which would inspire Arthur Hailey's later novel  \""Airport\"")  the story centers around a routine commercial flight between Honolulu and San Francisco  which becomes a life-and-death drama when one engine explodes  just beyond the 'Point of No Return'. With limited fuel  in deteriorating weather  the crisis brings out the best and worst in both passengers and crew.Wayne as the co-pilot  is quite good  playing a character older than he actually was (the role had been written for Spencer Tracy  who pulled out  just prior to filming); Robert Stack almost foreshadows his character in \""Airplane!\"" as the no-nonsense pilot who goes ballistic when stressed. For cockpit 'overacting'  however  the award has to go to Wally Brown  as the navigator  with his bugged-out eyes  visions of his shrewish wife  and WILDLY unruly hair...While the passengers are all stereotypes  several actors are quite good in their roles  with standout performances by Claire Trevor and Jan Sterling (both Oscar-nominated)  Robert Newton  Paul Kelly  and Paul Fix. While Phil Harris attempts to inject humor into his role  it only works sporadically (and Ann Doran  as his wife  plays 'hysterical' so convincingly that you want to STRANGLE her!) Laraine Day  third-billed (and  with Trevor  a previous Wayne leading lady)  is remarkably unlikable as a rich wife with a 'bought' husband (John Howard); Sidney Blackmer plays the 'mandatory' unbalanced type; and veteran character actor John Qualen adds another 'ethnic' portrayal to his long list  as a Latin family man (with a Norwegian accent!) A bit of trivia: The young boy on board was portrayed by director Wellman's son! Almost as fascinating as the story is seeing how much has changed  since the film was released; the plane's 'tail' is controlled by pulleys and wires in a rear compartment; the sole flight attendant is a \""stewardess\""; and everyone smokes (especially in the cockpit). On a more somber note  there is NO security  and one passenger boards easily  carrying a gun. It is  sadly  a wiser world  today...While no one would ever accuse \""The High and the Mighty\"" of being a film classic  it's role in creating the 'airplane disaster' genre can't be denied  and it continues to be a vastly enjoyable John Wayne feature.It's great to have it back!\tI love Sap. And I love John Wayne. I'd rather see a \""sappy\"" John Wayne movie any day  than ANYTHING the entertainment field is offering me \""fresh from Hollywood\"". There is a reason that Hollywood has been in a terrible slump lately. Maybe by some standards this movie isn't \""realistic enough\"" these days  but maybe that alone is half the appeal. The definition these days of \""realistic\"" usually means crude  rude  and jaded. It mostly means something I don't want my kids to see  and it always means something I am not relaxed or comfortable watching  either. If John Wayne is \""unrealistic\""  then so be it. But for my two bits  those people in this movie were a lot more \""real\"" than what Hollywood is generating these days. One thing I saw was a mind set among the characters that came from a day when commitments meant something  and they all still had a conscience. And they all wanted very much to be better than they really were. And it didn't take near as much to remind them that they WANTED things to work out right. I'd rather see that 'sappy\"" attitude any day. I'll pick waiting 40 years to see John Wayne over anything more sophisticated from Hollywood  every single time. John Wayne always rates a 10 star from me  I know I can rely on him.\tWhat a great trip back into the 1950's when airplane travel was new and dangerous! This picture has it all: A big silent hero  the young \""scientific\"" pilot  the cast of passengers  etc. As bad as this movie is (a 10-year-old kid who sleeps for 12 hours on a rock-and-rolling prop plane  and an Italian immigrant who is treated like a child) there's something to love about it. It's the innocence of the time and the drama of Hollywood. My favorite part is when they are going to decrease the weight of the plane to save on fuel. While an average size  middle age passenger hangs on to the Duke  luggage is tossed out the door of the plane. Oh sure! And  if that isn't campy enough  a wealthy woman with a new attitude sacrifices her mink coat to help with the weight of the plane. What's in the pockets  gold bars? With all the flaws  I still hold my breath when the Duke says  \""We can't turn back  we've past the point of no return.\"" Drama like it used to be!\tSeveral younger reviewers  posing as critics  have projected their post-1994 angst onto \""The High and the Mighty\"". They have tried to make its virtues into defects I suggest because they have failed to understand the normative  non-surreal self-responsibility requirements that individuals in the 1950s tacitly accepted as their price for exercising U.S. rights under regulation. They also do not understand apparently that this flight was being undertaken as a very-long flight  and barely seven years after the end of WWII. One complained that there was talk of disaster from the beginning; I found none except some fear on the part of one neurotic passenger. And there is something else that needs to be said about the film. It was directed by William Wellman  aviation's greatest champion in Hollywood history. That may be one reason why the resulting film is in my judgment the most realistic portrayal of a 1950s airport  airplane crew  airplane flight and airplane disaster-near disaster film in history--to this day... I flew on prop planes in 1950; this is the real thing. As for the emotional belief that it is \""corny'  its script telegraphs some of its punches concerning passengers' ideas  but only the surreal philosophy of statist-postmodernist thinkers could see in this beautifully- thought-out film as anything but what most viewers believe it to be--the very entertaining fictional account of a distrusted loner saving an entire planeload of interesting passengers from a physical disaster to whose impending happening each reacts in his own individual way. The film opens at Honolulu Airport as flight 420 is being readied for takeoff. A succession of passengers come to the desk manned by an airline official and the flight's stewardess; so the viewer is thus cleverly allowed to discover a good bit about each one at the same time as do the refreshingly judgmental pair of officers. At the same time  we are told the story of nice-guy Dan Roman  played by John Wayne; he was the pilot of a plane that once ran into wind shear; the rear of that plane was destroyed; on impact.; he survived the death of his wife and son to fly again. The list of those aboard is long and fascinating. In addition to cynical young crewman William Campbell  uxorious navigator Wally Brown  up-tight young Robert Stack and Wayne  we meet Sidney Blackmer  overwrought and insistent; ebullient Phil Harris and his wife Ann Doran  sensible and prolific Johna Qualen  intelligent Claire Trevor  Jan Sterling as an aging beauty queen worried about meeting her new mail-contact fianc\u00e9e  handsome couple John Smith and Karen Sharpe as newlyweds  Paul Fix who is elderly and unflappable  Dorothy Chen  John Howard  flight-fearing Robert Newton and his loyal wife lovely Julie Bishop  secret-keeping Paul Kelly and dynamic David Brian  and a little boy  among others. The story develops as the great airplane shudders in mid-air; gradually a crisis develops with an engine losing power. Then it is hit by a bullet  and a fire disables it and must be extinguished. The exact number of gallons of high-octane fuel aboard then becomes critical. The threat of a disaster is told in five parts--the inception; examinations and worsenings; the potential of having to ditch is faced; Wayne forces Stack to try for the coast instead of ditching; and the final climax plays out as the onshore wind gives them their last chance to make one try at the runway--with ultimately only 30 gallons of fuel left. As the potential problem develops  the passengers and crew must deal with the film's plot-theme--\""taking charge of one's own life\""; one man pulls a gun on the man he suspects of having made love to his wife; others have to be stopped from screaming  others face issues long put aside  others express regrets  hopes or fears; others demand or ask for information; and the crew face their own problems as well. Uniting the whole taut drama is the towering experience  calm and underplaying by Wayne and the thin-voice maturity  intelligence and normalcy of Doe Avedon as the chief stewardess. The other unusual feature of the film is Wellman's use of extended flashbacks for a number of persons  which is a feature that indicates to viewers information as well as passage of time. Here it is used in several innovative ways-to indicate character  to reinforce dramatic points and to strengthen the presentation of values such as a nuclear scientist's reasons for quitting his job  etc. The script for the novel was written by the author of the original novel \""The High and the Mighty\""  aviation fiction expert Ernest K. Gann. The cinematography was done by Archie J. Stout  and the music which uses Wayne whistling the main theme among other presentations was done by Dimitri Tiomkin  co-author of the famous and popular title song  which was a hit both with and without lyrics. Among the solid cast also one should note Regis Toomey  Laraine Day  Douglas Kennedy  and Gonzales Gonzales. Among the main characters  Wayne  David Brian  Sindey Blackmer  Claire Trevor  John Howard  Julie Bishop  Robert Newton  Phil Harris  John Qualen and Robert Stack all do standout work. The scene where luggage is jettisoned to lighten the plane  the gradual revelation of the aircraft's problems  the dialogue sequences and the entire atmosphere of the film--as well as the gripping climactic approach to San Francisco--are all memorable.achievements in my view. Watch for Wayne's explanation that they will probably have to ditch  addressed to all the passengers. This is a nearly-great and unarguably a deservedly popular film.\tI just saw 'The High and the Mighty' on AMC cable. It was soooo good with no swearing  special effects  or dumb dialoque. The characters were many well-known actors and actresses that did not overshadow the content of the movie. It is always enjoyable to view an older movie that connects you with a intrigue and drama but does not rely upon artificial effects or senseless characters. The sight of John Wayne  Robert Stack  and other actors in a situation that was quite unique when filmed. We witnessed real human drama and a personal glimpse of how we could have reacted if we were there. It was very enjoyable to watch a very well made movie with an excellent cast of characters and a well-written script. And the music was super too. I recommend this movie to anyone who places quality over anything else. It is still possible to enjoy a well-written  acted  and directed movie without blood  guts  explosions  or special effects.\tWilliam Wellman directs this well thought of 1954 adventure. A little lengthy; but the notable ensemble featuring John Wayne makes THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY a nail-biter worth seeing. Engine problems develop on a commercial airliner while on a trans-Pacific flight. The pilot  played by Robert Stack  gets a little rattled and loses his confidence and relies on his washed-up co-pilot(Wayne) to bring the plane down safely. The passengers on board reflect on their lives and relationships  all the while fearing their endangered aircraft would crash any moment. The possibility of a crash weighed heavy on the co-pilot's mind  since he had already lost his family in a plane crash. Dimitri Tiomkin's beautiful and sometimes haunting score won a well deserved Oscar. The all-star cast also features: Claire Trevor  Laraine Day  Regis Toomey  Robert Newton  Jan Sterling  Phil Harris and John Qualen.\tI saw High and Mighty in 1954  and again tonight (7/28/05) on TV. In 1954  my mother was so impressed with the theme song that she bought the red and white sheet music. It was the first piano music I learned in 5 flats. However  tonight I was outraged that the flashbacks were cut  as well as the final scene when John Wayne picks up the broken balsa wood plane. The edited out flashback of the wreckage on the cliffs just off the beach with the partly burned teddy bear amongst the strewn wreckage created a uniquely piquant depth of self doubt in the John Wayne character  as to whether he would repeat another crash. The 9 rating is for the uncut version (although I concede the original had too many flashbacks of the same thing and were too long). Hopefully when I get the DVD  it will be complete  and my criticism here is merely reflective of the TV version.\tI guess this was one of the first disaster movies  at least in the air and i don't know why i had never heard of it until it came out on DVD. I don't see why it had such a low profile among John Wayne's other films since it is better then most of Wayne's films that i've seen. At first Wayne was only going to produce it and offered it to Spencer Tracy but Wayne ended up doing the part himself. Even though Wayne has top billing it's almost like he isn't the main star  which works for this kind of film. There are some problems with the film like it being almost two and a half hours and they could of cut out some of the passengers personal stories. This is one of Wayne's best films and should have a larger profile.\t\""The High and the Mighty\"" has been hidden away in the John Wayne family vaults for many years. The recent DVD release remedies that and presents this near classic fully restored and uncut. I say near classic because although the film is an exciting and well acted drama  it is nonetheless a little dated and predictable.The story involves the flight of a plane load of passengers from Honolulu to San Francisco. Along the way one of the engines fail and it becomes questionable as to whether the plane will make to San Francisco or have to be ditched in the open sea. The crux of the film is how the crew and the passengers react and interact with each other in dealing with the emergency.Climbing aboard are the crew  Pilot John Sullivan (Robert Stack)  Co-pilot Dan Roman (John Wayne)  Second Officer Wheeler (William Campbell)  Navigator Lenny Wilby (Wally Brown) and Stewardess Miss Spalding (Doe Avedon). Sullivan is a capable pilot  but can he handle the emergency he faces? Roman is an experienced pilot who was involved in a plane crash from which only he survived and where he lost his wife and child.The passenger list includes Claire Trevor as May Holst a past her prime actress  David Brian as Ken Childs a womanizing executive who is attracted to May. Sidney Blackmer plays Agnew who has a score to settle with Childs. John Qualen plays Lacota who keeps an eye on Agnew. Jan Sterling is Sally McKee an aging former beauty queen who is going to meet her pen pal lover (William Hopper) but is unsure of how he will perceive her.Laraine Day and John Howard play Lydia and Howard Rice  she an heiress and he the husband trying to make it on his own terms. Phil Harris and Ann Doran are the hapless Ed and Clara Joseph returning from a disastrous second honeymoon  Robert Newton and Julie Bishop as the Pardees  he a self centered theatrical man and she his skeptical wife. John Smith and Karen Sharpe are the newlywed Milo and Nell Buck and Paul Fix is Frank Briscoe a man preparing to die until he meets the quiet and unassuming Dorothy Chen (Joy Kim) with whom he strikes up a new friendship. Young Michael Wellman (the son of Director William Wellman) rounds out the passenger list as Toby Field a little boy on his way to meet his mother.Others in the rather large cast are Pedro Gonzoles-Gonzoles as a ship board radio operator  George Chandler as an airport mechanic  Douglas Fowley as a ticket agent  Regis Toomey  William Schallert  Douglas Kennedy and Robert Easton as various airport officials  Carl \""Alfalfa\"" Switzer as a Coast Guard Co-pilot  Walter Reed as the young boy's father and Phil Van Zandt and Dorothy Ford as the annoying couple who ruin the Joseph's holiday.This film was one of the early Cinemascope features. Director William Wellman uses the entire frame effectively and avoids close ups as much as possible. He keeps the story moving and provides us with several sub-plots among the characters. It was one of the first airline disaster movies and certainly the first in Cinemascope and color.The DVD contains several behind the scenes documentaries hosted by Leonard Maltin and an interesting feature commentary with Maltin and William Wellman Jr. with contributions from cast members Karen Sharpe and Pedro Gonzoles-Gonzoles.\tThis is the best John Wayne picture I've ever seen. Until viewing this terrific DVD  my favorite was 1951's \""Operation Pacific\"". The restoration of the feature is very nice. That includes the vibrant \""WarnerColor\"" and the crisp soundtrack. The second disc of the set has many features  one of which covers the arduous task of restoring a tired old print and hissing soundtrack so that we can see and hear it as did the audience in 1954.I also really enjoyed the featurette on Dimitri Tiomkin and absolutely endorse the notion that the score is as important to this picture as any other element.It is interesting to me  a vintage plane buff  that the ship they used was a then-obsolete Douglas DC-4. The head stewardess (not being chauvinistic -- they were called \""stewardessess\"" back then) mentioned that they'd be flying around 6-7 thousand feet. That's accurate  as the DC-4 had no pressurization. Since the DC-6 (which was pressurized and could fly higher) was introduced in '48  it was very commonplace by '54. My theory is that the airlines and Douglas Aircraft lobbied 20th Century Fox to use an old plane  lest the flying public worry that the current DC-6s were subject to such failure. I'd be interested if someone can confirm this.\tof a plane load of passengers en route from Honolulu to San Francisco  but this film has all of the ingredients of great high drama  pun intended. It may seem to us jet setters that a film based on the mechanical failures of a prop plane that flies 200 MPH at 9 000 feet above sea level is anything but a comedy a la \""Airplane\""  but this classic with Wayne at the production helm and Wellman (WINGS) in the director's chair is 22 karat gold Hollywood. The passenger list reads like a \""Who's Who\"" of the film industry  including Robert Newton  Jan Sterling  Claire Trevor  Phil Harris  Robert Stack and Larraine Day. Wellman effectively collects each passenger's story and through the process of well edited flashbacks  presents a slice of each character's life. Stack  as Sullivan the pilot  has lost his nerve until the Duke slaps him out of it. Phil Harris tries to help console a fellow passenger whose marriage is on the brink through the telling of an hysterical litany of \""woe is me\"" misadventures. Robert Newton discovers himself in this crisis as a helpful  caring hero  calming the others and helping Wayne throw the cargo overboard. Sydney Blackmer's attempts to murder on board ship his wife's would be lover and John Quane's folksy immigrant on his first flight provide ample dramatic and comic relief from the plight of flight 4027 which has lost one engine  most of its fuel and is destined to plunge into the Pacific Ocean. There is romance of course in the abundant kissing and embracing of the newlyweds played by John Smith and Karen Sharpe. Jan Sterling provides a steamier  albeit more controlled sexuality as the \""bad girl\"" on her way to meet her \""good guy\"" mail order husband. Interestingly  Sterling switches places with Claire Trevor on this trip. Trevor played the bad girl in the Duke's first hit \""Stagecoach\""  but she is the heroine stewardess  hiding her own fears of death while making sure everyone has a life vest. And then there's the Duke  himself! Tall and proud  he stands silently and unflinchingly as others throw barbs at him about his age  his shadowy past as the only pilot who did not go down with his plane  and his competence in the cockpit. When the chips are down  he proves once again that a man can feel fear  but act heroically at the same time. With measured emotions that are betrayed only by an infrequent facial reaction  he calms the passengers  shakes some guts into the pilot  and then glides the plane into a safe landing. All's well that ends well as the Cowboy cum pilot limps off whistling Dimitri Tiomkin's award winning score. Now that's high and mighty!\tWhen I read the comments of others who say this movie \""does not wear well \"" I have to laugh at much of the trash Hollywood has made the last few years. Much of what is made today doesn't even stand up against today's low standards.The High and the Mighty actually has a STORY and characters who have conflicts  hopes  fears and loves.I was a young boy of about six when our family flew the first United Airlines DC-7 flight from Honolulu to San Francisco. I can remember what it was like to hang high above the Pacific for many hours with four massive radial engines roaring outside the cabin. This movie captures the realism of such a flight.This movie also brings back memories of how passengers DRESSED UP to fly in those days. The sloppy appearance of today's airline passengers is in marked contrast to the class exhibited by airline passengers of the fifties.I even remember the Honolulu Airport of the early fifties and the look of the counters and can remember the fragrance of fresh flower leis as we walked through the airport. I remember how we walked out into the sunshine to board the plane by climbing steps to the cabin door.Yes  this movie is a different world. It's Hawaii as a U.S. Territory  as when I lived there. It's a throwback to a time when pilots were fresh from a World War. Men acted more like gentlemen then  as they do in this movie  and ladies had a lot more class before our modern age made it acceptable for both sexes to be so crass.The writing may seem archaic by modern Hollywood standards but it fit perfectly the era in which it was made and gives us a wonderful glimpse of the beginning of the golden age of commercial aviation.This movie captures all of this brilliantly and provides a complex mix of characters living an ominous threat to their survival.I loved it as a boy and love it now. I bought the Special Edition DVD just recently and love it immensely.It has a lengthy series of featurettes and will surely please lovers of John Wayne and the rest of the cast and of this movie in particular.As an additional footnote  I want to add the following: In the late 1970's  after I received my own private pilot's license  and after reading one of Ernest K. Gann's other books  I wrote a fan letter to Mr. Gann  with my comments about sharing his love of flying. It was simply addressed to him at San Juan Island  Washington. I was overjoyed to receive a very nice personal reply from this talented writer of the book and screenplay  \""The High and the Mighty.\"" He was a brilliant writer and his writing really captured the essence of flying in those golden years.\tWilliam A. Wellman's The High & The Mighty (1954) might very well be called the 'Grand Hotel' of the wild blue yonder. For it stacks a commercial airliner with an all star crew and passenger list then forces everyone to interact when a mid-air malfunction puts everyone's life in peril. Top billed is legendary hero  John Wayne as co-pilot Dan Roman. Seems Roman is living with demons of a fiery plane crash lurking just beneath the surface. The pilot  John Sullivan (Robert Stack) is a stoic  troubled and neurotic mess who eventually has a complete melt down \u0096 forcing Roman to rise to the occasion  take over and land the plane safely. Ah  but will he? The rest of the cast reads like a who's who of forgotten or nearly forgotten character actors  including Sidney Blackmere  Laraine Day  Phil Harris and Claire Trevor. Despite being one of the most sought after titles requested by DVD consumers  the film is really little more than a sensationalist precursor to the highly popular 70s disaster series  Airport. The one curiosity of this disc is that it is a Warner Brothers film presented by Paramount DVD. Apparently a rights issue has allowed the copyright to lapse in the latter's favor.Advertised as meticulously restored  the transfer represented on this disc is something of a disappointment to the expectation of pristine image quality. Although the DVD starts out relatively strong  with a very bright and strongly contrasted print element  it quickly degrades into various levels of quality \u0096 the worst being near the end of the fil"
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005),"As a longtime fan of the Hitchhiker Guide book series  I was very excited that they were finally making a big-budget treatment of the original classic. After seeing it on opening day  I thought the movie was well-cast  well-acted and well-produced. The visual effects were great (and I even like how they reinterpreted Zaphod's two-headed aspect using minimal  yet non-cheesy looking effects). And Zooey Deschanel is hot.But as the movie came to a close  it became achingly clear that there is no possible way a normal two-hour movie could really do the book justice  despite all the great things about it. Even though it has been years since I last read the book  I realized as I was watching this movie that so many things that made the book great were edited out of the movie. This movie was hacked to pieces! If everything had been included in this movie  it would have doubled or tripled the run-time  which would just not have been commercial and therefore would have made this movie's release inconceivable.I left the theater wishing that I had recently re-read the book to fill in the many blanks I felt from watching this movie. So when it becomes available on DVD  I'll re-read the book immediately before renting it for one final viewing. And hopefully the deleted scenes will fill in a few more gaps.If you're reading this and haven't yet read the book  my suggestion is to read the book in conjunction with watching the movie  just to see how other imaginations have interpreted parts of the book. I am sad to report that this movie simply doesn't (and can't) stand on it's own.42\tThe preview I saw of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy showed almost nothing about the movie itself. In this way they unintentionally acknowledged that it is hard to translate the books and radio broadcasts to the big screen. But it would also immediately make clear that this is one of the worst movies ever made.As the books are unconventional in form and content  a conventional movie was no option. So they had to place this somewhere else in the movie universe. Instead of mixing different styles  which could have worked  they rely mostly on absurd humor served to you with an anarchistic tone. The movie is quintessential British  but this is not Python at work. The actors are helpless and clumsy here with the material; the director doesn't have a visual clue where it's going and works by the numbers. There are several (intended?) continuity problems.It has cheap production values  laughable sets and an irritating soundtrack. The first cartoon intermezzo was somewhat funny  but they become so repetitious (like many jokes in the movie) that you lose interest soon. A missed opportunity is also that further mapping of the characters to living groups on earth would extend beyond the Vogons as bureaucrats and Humma Kavula as religious leader.One plus is the funny beginning  when earth is destroyed for a galactic highway whereas Dent's home is also under threat from a highway on earth. And when a back-up earth is made there are some funny scenes like filling the ocean with water.It seems the audience was totally forgotten when making this. To sit through this is torture. Half the cinema was empty at the end. You can't say I haven't warned you.\tI hope  they(producers) will never ever put a finger on Terry Pratchett's work. Or did they already???? Oh  NOOOOOOOO! After this remark I can add a few things: 1. Trillian should not have been a romantic character at all 2. The people (viewers) should have been pointed to why the Vogon is sitting on a gazelle with a broken back or why does he crushes a crab. 3. Ford Prefect is \only\"" O.K 4. I wish they could make Zaphod with two separate heads so that we could see his facial expression of both heads at the same time. 5. Marvin should have had more lines 6. I wish D.N.A was still alive :( 7. I am grateful that the movie was not any worse as I could not bear it. 8. Thanks for reading this comment:)\tOK  the Vogons were beautifully done and the FX were nice. One major drawback was that the movie based on the funniest book on earth was not funny. But what did I expect? If you have read a joke and then see it repeated in an alternative medium  there's hardly a chance that you may laugh.Still: the television series - in all its clumsiness - was enjoyable  so what is the explanation that this was not? - The acting was quite bad - The additions to the book were silly - There were no funny twists to surprise you if you had read the book - The timing was not stimulatingAh  well. The voice of Alan Rickman for the depressed robot was well cast. And John Malkovich had nice glasses. Think I'll change my name to Marvin...\tAfter reading the 5 books and loving them  listening to the original radio series and loving it and seeing the old BBC TV-series and  well  liking that a bit (there's something about low-budget BBC scifi)  along comes the movie. The thing that sets the movie apart from the other creations is that Douglas Adams is dead  and probably turning in his grave.Right off the bat it starts butchering the dry British wit of the book by destroying the scene where Arthur lies in front of the bulldozers  and then goes downhill from there. It seems that the filmmakers decided to cut a lot of things from the book to save time  yet ADD completely new stuff that has nothing to do with anything.As an example: I can't recall ever reading about Trillian being arrested by the vogons for kidnapping Zaphod  thereby forcing the rest of the crew to come save her. Nope. I wonder where the hell that came from. Yet another: And I surely don't recall ever hearing about Zaphod getting one of his heads cut off in order get the coordinates to Magrathea - where Deep Though apparently has moved to (for some odd reason). And deep thought makes weapons as well. Ah yes. Now I wonder which page all this is on.And it just goes on and on and on with this complete disregard for the books and the excellent humor within  an americanized easily digested movie with jokes and plots so thin you get paper cuts from them.To top it off they end the movie with the text \""For Douglas\"". Yeah  I'm sure he likes that.This movie is nothing short of an atrocity  and Adams must be turning in his grave by this point.\tAfter reading the book \""The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy\"" I borrowed from a friend last December  I was curious if anyone would consider to make it into a movie. I got lucky  because as soon as I logged in on IMDb I found out they were already making it! So now I had to test my patience..Waiting from January to July (I live in the Netherlands and saw the sneak preview  officially it comes out in 3 days)  and finally I got to see it.I loved it. but I couldn't tell why? It's almost as impossible to tell how much I loved this film  as to explain what it's about (\""Well  it's about a whale and dolphins and a man and construction workers and a king of the universe and a guide for what to do in certain occasions\""). But there are certain aspects in the movie that make it so fun to watch. Sam Rockwell's crazy enough to play someone with the name Zaphod Beeblebrox and Martin Freeman is perfect as a neurotic British man.The only thing I can say about this movie is don't panic and hey  losing your planet isn't the end of the world ;)\tI never thought I'd say this about myself  but I'm thinking of something Bill Maher said in an opening monologue for \""Realtime\"": \""If you waited in line for 6 hours dressed as Luke Skywalker  you came to the wrong show. And you're a loser.\"" I'm so torn. One problem might have been that the sound in the theater where I saw this was not very good; there were times when I wouldn't have been sure what the characters were saying  except that I already knew the lines from the book; quite a few other lines escaped me.I can see the writers/producers made a valiant effort to morph the storyline into the Blockbuster Feature Film Format. I'm sincere here; I really do think it was valiant  and my hat's off to them. But I have to put that aside and ask if it worked.And it's hard to say.Some of the new ideas were surprisingly resonant for me; the requisite (feature film) love interest actually worked; and I particularly enjoyed the way they dovetailed that in to the preexisting elements such as the new Earth from Magarathea  and Arthur/Trillian's resolve to give that up--in a way  giving up the promise of a new Eden  the opportunity to get the \""di cho\"" (\""Earth\"" in Chinese; literally  \""dirt ball\"") rolling again  in exchange for the need for adventure  to \""go somewhere.\"" How amazingly  if not outright obsessively  conciliatory of the minds behind this to treat old fans to the spectacle of the two chief Vogon pastimes rendered as (of all things) a *sight gag*. Who'd o' thunk? But can the movie have universal appeal? I'm afraid it may not. The true test is in how it will be received by those who haven't read the books. But then  I have a feeling that no one who digs sci-fi has *not* read the books  or at least that first book. So I may be concerned about the response of a non-existent demographic; people who haven't read the books  who would nonetheless take in a movie like this.This I know; the response here in Taiwan has been poor. There's an interesting challenge  as sci-fi is not a big genre here.I'm fully aware that the foregoing is all muddled. But I have mixed feelings. In so many ways  I should be thankful that this thing finally came to fruition. But I still basically feel that the book is (sigh) better. Well  of course it is; it (almost) always is. But this is one of those rare moments where I feel compelled to make special note of the fact  unfortunately.OK. If you're a fan  see the movie and report back. In triplicate.\tWell I've read the book when I was a kid  really enjoyed the BBC TV series back in the '80s so my expectations were high for the movie....and I wasn't to be disappointed.The cast is pretty much as good as you could hope for  Martin Freeman (Arthur Dent) Zooey Deschanal (Trillion) Mos Def (Ford Prefect) Sam Rockwell (Zaphod) are all excellent  Stephen Fry was born to be the narrator  but the the star of the show was Marvin  the depressed  well near suicidal Robot.Voiced brilliantly by Alan Rickman  he steals every scene he's in  it's a pity he didn't get more screen time really.The sfx are sometimes cheap and cheerful  others quite superb  the scenes of the Magrathea factory floor are breathtaking.The Vogans look and sound great too  like a bunch of Inter-galactic civil servants shuffling around.The film ends with a sequel (The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe) looking likely and  I for one  wouldn't complain.\tThis was a loving tribute to Douglas Adams? It was absolute garbage  even if a viewer had not read the book  listened to the radio series  saw the TV series it was a rubbish film.The plot was very loosely based on the book  the film was totally disjointed  there were hardly any references to the Guide itself  Ford Prefect acted like he was stoned for all the film. The Vogons became the Galactic police force it seems  Deep Thought changed into a woman  Arthur Dent became a babe magnet  Zaphod Beeblebrox was in reality a very clever person who had to divide his brain to become the President? To cap it all they remade the Earth exactly as it was before the Vogons destroyed it  why? Where was all the wonderful dialog? Half the characters were missing  the rest were mere shadows of what they should have been. The whole thing shows that the people who wrote the screenplay  and directed it have not got a clue what Douglas Adams wrote or what he would have wanted. I would imagine he is spinning in his grave now!\tI was a little disappointed in the film initially  as I have watched the TV series on several occasions  but on a second viewing  I did enjoy the film. The film version of Zaphod was not a patch on the two headed TV version  being too \""in your face\"" unlike the super cool TV version (well in my opinion anyway).The film Marvin also had a much more limited part compared with the TV show  but I did appreciate the real nice touch of having the original (tv) version of Marvin standing in the queue at the Vogon office.From where the film finished  it looks like there will be a sequel (The Restaurant at the End of the Universe?) which should be good  and hopefully will reveal the Ultimate Question\t\""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\"" has the feel of a movie that's taken the long route to the screen. The fact that Douglas Adams  deceased by a few years  gets both screenplay and executive producer credits would seem to confirm this. It's tough turning beloved cult texts into films  and \""Hitchhiker's\"" is no exception. The good news for fans of Adams' interstellar celebration of absurdity is that the movie actually gets quite a bit right. Yet it suffers from an odd patchwork feel that makes the books virtually required reading to have the slightest inkling of what's going on.Any story involving the demolition of earth for an intergalactic bypass  planet-size supercomputers  infinite improbability drives  and poetry-reciting space creatures has a bit of explaining to do. Adams  gifted with a rare verbal dexterity  was in his books able to introduce and discard such elements with a comic insouciance that somehow more of less made sense. The film has a tendency to get stuck  though; it's neither able to juggle all this goofiness with Adams' deft touch  nor provide any context for neophytes. Those familiar with the books will get  for example  what's so important about towels  and why Galactic President Zaphod Beeblebrox has two heads and three arms  and will perhaps forgive the film for its fairly muddled presentation of such. But \""Hitchhiker's\"" is full of moments that will leave new initiates scratching their heads.The film makes the unfortunate decision to highlight the silliness through visuals  rather than Adams' offbeat dialogue. The effects and production design assume a deliberate cheesiness in an attempt to match the story's tone  but end up looking like a strange marriage of \""The Muppet Show\"" and \""Dr. Who.\"" The movie is eager to cram in as many of Adams' comic bits as possible  but too often does so at the expense of continuity. It jumps from one oddity to the next  treating them more as sketches than parts of a coherent whole. Nonetheless  there are a nice realizations of a few of the author's delightful inanities  such as the pleasantly sighing doors of the heroes' spaceship  and a philosophical sperm whale destined for a tragic end.The jumble of activity that \""Hitchhiker's\"" tries to balance leaves its characters  among them rescued earthling Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) and his space jockey friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def)  so occupied reacting to events that they can't create fully-formed personalities. Too often we get a punchline without the accompanying set up. A film adaptation of any book needs to be accessible to non-readers; it's unfair to rely upon viewers to fill in the blanks with a background familiarity they may not possess. Love it or hate it  \""Hitchhiker's\"" fans will at least get the gist of this movie. For anyone else  though  the book  at a quick 200 pages  will be a far more satisfying and coherent alternative.\tThere's parts from the book left out  but that's obviously due to the length of the whole series of books from sadly deceased Douglas Adams. Left out thingies are quite a lot but the cricket-ball-shaped vessel instead of the absolutely shining ship was quite fun. reflecting back on the krikkit's. Now please remember I've only read the Swedish translation of the books  not the original edition.The vogons is disgusting  and the characters perfect  the planet building scenes are very good. It's fun  and I'll put my kids in front of this absurdly fun movie  doing the best it can out of Douglas Adams suite of books. But I liked the \""original movies\"" solution of having two heads instead of the flip-flop version in this movie. If you do have two heads you have two heads  Good movie. When you have reading kids  first give them the books to read and then let them watch the movie. They will immediately understand a lot more then.\tI heard the radio series when I was a kid.I watched the TV series first time around and thought it was utterly new and exciting.I collected the original trilogy as soon as they came out in paperback... brilliant.Then the fourth and fifth parts came - okay  but not the genius we'd seen previously.Then the new radio series came along... like books 4 & 5; I had to listen religiously  even though they weren't great like they used to be.And finally news of the movie going into production at last.Now  since H2G2 hasn't been \""fantastic\"" since the early eighties  I was worried... very worried. Given the tendency for movies to screw up books' stories  I was even more worried - so I spent a lot of effort following its progress and trying to convince myself it could be pretty good. Then I read the early reviews on IMDb and told myself that while some people said it wasn't so good  a lot of others thought it was well worth it.And then it came to that fateful night when my girlfriend's sister called and asked us which movie we'd like to see together... and I suggested Hitchhiker's - but they could watch anything else if they wanted.Hitchhiker's it was...Oh dear oh dear oh dear. They're still mocking me for it. To put it bluntly  it's bad. Very bad. Under the circumstances of that evening  it was personally-embarrassing bad.It's taken a month for me to get up the courage to write this  but here's what I can remember...It opens with a musical number which seems totally out of place (and isn't very good).It has no flow whatsoever  either in terms of story or editing. Things happen  you don't know why. Suddenly something else happens  but you don't know why. I was either lucky or cursed to know what should have been explained the whole time... goodness knows what the girls made of it.The dialogue is terrible - either the result of poor acting  poor screenplay or poor editing. I don't know which  but I do know that there was a lot of incoherent mumbling or shouting throughout.The characters had no character. I loved each and every one of them from the radio series' and books  but here they are flat  boring and sometimes just annoying (Trillian and Zaphod). Marvin (\""he was cute\"" said the future sister in law!) had a tiny spark of the original  but only has about five lines in the whole movie. Strange  I used to think he was the most outstanding character in the entire oeuvre!.On a plus point  the visual effects were nice - although I have to say I liked the book sequences in the TV series a lot more.(Minor spoiler in this paragraph.) The messing with the story didn't improve things at all. The missing bits left gaping holes and the re-writing turned it all into a Hollywood \""running from the bad guys\"" clich\u00e9... which it never was!!! The added bits were pointless and not very funny. Which brings us to the real problem...This film is not funny. Where before there was great wit  there is now tame slapstick (you've watched the \""funniest\"" bits already if you've seen the trailer!). What were once huge  convoluted  intelligent jokes are now rushed  throwaway links to the next scene. The weird little twists and concepts that put a smile on your face seem to have taken the day off. Most of the punchlines and proper delivery seemed to be missing. It makes you wonder if the makers actually understood the humour in the first place!.And quirky humour was basically the point of Hitchhiker's  was it not?\tDid you read the books? Did you like them? Do you think it would make a great movie?Well Since i love the books and have read them about ten times or so I was very glad to hear that they finally was going to put it on the silver-screen. But what a disappointment it was to me when I realized that it wasn't the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy I have learned to love and laughed to for several years that came out of this production but a mere shadow of the geniality of Douglas Adams masterpiece.Don't expect to much from this film. The movie makers has taken some pieces from each of the books  added a lot of their own and made something that is: almost  but not quite  entirely unlike the original text.This is probably the worst book to movie transfer I have ever seen  not only because of the almost non existing similarity to the original text but also: the acting is bad  the special effects is even worse and I'm sad to say that the mini-series from 1981 is far better on all aspects  and I'm no fan of them either.Douglas Adams R.I.P\tWith all of the recent mammoth-budgeted sci-fi movies  we came to except that all of them...the matrix  star wars etc etc are way too serious  some of them utterly mediocre whilst the rest either lacks substance or the elements that makes good films.I've never read the novel and therefor had no idea who or what Hitchhiker was...This movie has a strong English sense about it...the dry humor and the actors' overall ability to act properly.Yes  this movie was impressive and I liked it very much. It is without a doubt the anti scifi hit of this year and for once a movie exist that was actually made for an audience with some brains.\tSo I read all the books in about 3 weeks total. Which was a lot for me at the time. I also read Starship Titanic  Dirk Gentley  and The Long  Dark Teatime of the Soul  which was possibly my favorite of them all. I even got one of my friends as interested in it as I was.So what did I do? I dragged my friends to the movie. I believe we waited in line in the rain for it.I basically felt like an idiot. The movie opens with the most random SONG I've ever seen. I thought since Douglas Adams was involved it would reflect the comedic genius of the books. Notsomuch. The good thing about the books is they were so wonderfully random yet everything was pieced together and it all made sense. Like the mention of he girl whose story it is \""not\"" in the first chapter  or the bowl of flowers. But it just comes off as stupid when you see it in the movie. See  most of the humor in the novels was via narration  which is hard to translate into a movie. I thought the movie was... OK... but I had such high hopes for it that I was very very disappointed by it. I liked their casting for Marvin  though. The Snape guy.\tThis is a poor dramatisation of H2G2. Although it has wonderful effects and although the section with Slartibartfarst is excellent it scores very poorly against the books  radio  records or BBC TV series. Having just watched the TV series again after the new feature film it's easy to see how (in general) the movie graphics and special effects are far superior to the TV series (the Vogons are particularly great looking - although they sound disinterested rather than evil).The actors in the movie are simply wooden and there is simply no empathy with the characters (Trillian is played in a particularly irritating way). The movie moves with the pace of an Arcturan Megacamel (very slowly) and the movie is an insult to the intelligence. It's simply terribly dull and tedious. There's a real lack of humour in the movie as well. Sad as Adams was involved in talks for many years to get this movie made.One area where the movie scores very badly is the book animations. The BBC did a far better job 20 years earlier. It seems technology has advanced but imagination has been left behind.Fans of H2G2 will be better off buying the BBC DVD rather than waste money in the box office.\tAs a Hitchhiker fan  I was afraid of this movie. I thought they could spoil the story and make an unintended mockery of Adams's cult book for those who haven't read it. But no  they made an excellent movie about it. The clip is fast and funny  The philosophy and bizarre humor is there. For those who know the story  there is something new as well  like the romance between Tricia and Arthur   a new character and an extra stop to a planet. The appearance and behavior of the characters were not quite what I made up in my head (especially Zaphod's heads)  but who could have imagined them better. The story is a bit more happy and optimistic than in the book. Now I'm afraid they make awful sequels to this excellent movie.\tBefore I begin  I would like to point out that I have read and love the book  but it wasn't important to me that the movie followed the plot exactly  as I know that would be pretty hard to do. I have no experience with the TV/radio series what so ever.(MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)I went to the theater to see this movie with my dad and two of my friends. I had somewhat mixed expectations towards it because from what I had seen in the trailers and so on didn't exactly give me the impression that they had focused on what I appreciate in the books. Already from the start  me and the movie didn't get along well  since i wasn't very happy with neither the introduction nor the dolphin song. \""So long and thanks for all the fish\"" is one of my all time favorite quotes  and I think it was delivered very poorly  partly by focusing too much on it by putting it right in the beginning  and presenting it in a way that might as well have said something like \""what they really said was  and this is the punch line  you might as well start laughing right now  check out how funny this is: so long and thanks for all the fish\"". Needless to say  I didn't like the song either  it just focused even more on the quote  almost wearing it out before it is even delivered. I felt this way about most of the good quotes.I felt the casting was decent. \""With a better script  I think they could have done a very well job. In fact Alan Rickman as Marvin was the perfect casting in my opinion  as it was pretty much exactly what I imagined his voice like when I read the books.The plot deviated a bit from the book  but I didn't mind that much. I did  however mind that every scene achieved to feel a bit pointless up until the meeting with Slartibarfast (which I DID like). I think the movie should be longer  as it felt very rushed. The few times I appreciated a scene  the movie moved on to something completely different  making me forget about the scene almost before it was over.For a movie that is supposed to be funny  I don't think that making me smile 2 or 3 times in total is a very good result. It was even more incohersive than the book  and way less interesting. The only response that came from the audience was a solitary chuckle a few times. I discussed these things with the others whom I watched it with (2 out of 3 having read the book) and they agreed with everything I said. I am usually not very critical about movies  and there are very few that I thing are downright poor  but this  I'm sorry to say  is one of them. I realize there are many of you out there who likes it and I respect that  but it just didn't win me over in any way.\tI admit that after seeing several bad reviews for this movie  I was prepared for something very bad when I went to watch it. Maybe it was partly due to the fact that my expectations had been lowered  but I actually quite enjoyed the show.The plot deviated a bit from the book - the main difference was actually the existence of a plot - but most of it remained loyal to Douglas Adams' original masterpiece. True  some jokes did not make it to screen  among them some of my favourites from the novel  but the movie made up for it with new jokes more suited to the film medium. In my opinion  the humour in the movie lay not so much in the jokes themselves  which admittedly weren't always very good  but more in the overall whacked-out craziness of the storyline and universe.Those who have not yet read the books  however  might not 'get' most of the movie  because it relies quite a bit on the audience having at least a vague idea of what is happening in order to keep track of the story. There are also a few in-jokes around that only fans would understand  so it would probably be a good idea to read the book before watching the show.One of the things I didn't like in the show was the sudden addition of the love-triangle subplot  because it did not seem to fit in with the original spirit of the book - but I'm generally a person who doesn't like romance movies much  so perhaps my opinion here might be slightly biased.Overall  the movie was a fun ride that went beyond my expectations. The cast was great and brought the characters to life  the music was great - singing dolphins; what more could you ask for? - and the script was a nice adaptation of print to screen. It could have been better  but it still remains a worthy addition to the Hitchhiker's franchise.Seven stars."""
The Island (2005),"Once again the critics prove themselves as morons! This movie was definitely the best I've seen this summer and deserves a lot more recognition than it is getting. People see the name Michael Bay and instantly think of a sappy action movie not worth the time  but trust me  this one is definitely worth your time and money.I won't comment on specifics of the story because I don't want to spoil it  but as a whole it is very impressive  and tackles many issues that we face in today's society.The acting is great  and Ewan McGregor pulled off his character perfectly. The innocence and wonder that he expresses as Lincoln 6 Echo was the best I've seen from him.I'll admit that the first half of the movie is better than the 2nd half  and the many chase scenes can get frustrating  but the action adds a lot to the movie  and the directing is wonderful.But the one point that this movie tackled which makes it noteworthy is the characterization. I really cared for the two lead characters and wanted to see them succeed in their goal  which is rare in most action films. I even enjoyed seeing the minor characters through the movie  so much that I cared about their outcomes. Not to mention that they are believable. The main character in this film isn't some invulnerable super action hero  he is frail and inexperienced when it comes to fighting. There weren't any moments that I thought he was going out of his capabilities. The characters are confused and weak  and they are depicted wonderfully.Come on people  stop obsessing over the frat comedies  crappy comic-book adaptations  and dumb horror movies  and treat yourself to a good film. Don't pass this one up. GO AND SEE IT NOW!\tDespite the critical bashing it's received from reviewers and friend  I figured we'd give it a fair shake anyhow  since the IMDb rated it above our other option for the afternoon  the remake of Bad News Bears. Oh. My. When we came out of it  my husband & I pretty much looked at each other and said \What the h*ll is everyone complaining about? That movie rocked!\""We seriously loved it. Both of us agree that it's the best action movie we've seen all year. Maybe in two years. It was fantastic! The story was actually based on a premise we find plausible  the acting was good  the stars are gorgeous. Steve Buscemi was great  of course. There were funny moments without overplaying the jokes. There were some silly action sequences  but you know what? If I am having a good time  I am willing to believe that someone could fall 70 stories holding on to a piece of scaffolding  and somehow get caught in a net and not be injured. There was never a point where there were so many bullets flying around it was ridiculous that they hadn't been shot. No one flew through the air in slow motion. Sure  there was cheesy dialogue  but I don't go to a movie like this for the script  that's what Cameron Crowe movies are for. Also  the female lead was not a) too tough to be believed or b) all bimboed up with mass cleavage and tiny skirts. She was modestly dressed the whole time  and was competent without being over the top action hero girl. There was one sex scene  it fit with the plot  and was tastefully filmed. Seriously  I wish I understood why people don't like it. I thought it was bloody terrific. I've been in a good mood all day just because I had such a great time at the movies!I give it two paws up.\tWhoa! This movie made my Sunday evening  and weekend as a whole. I mean  it's not a magnum opus  maybe a little creepy when you come to think of the concept - but the characterization and acting by the leads was just brilliant! Everything was so well crafted that you will exit from the movie theater with a smile. Unless you're weirder than weird  of course.While watching the movie  so many questions arose - Why a Scotsman (McGregor) is made to speak with an American accent? Why is he paired with a lady (Johannsen) 10 years younger to him. Guess what - even these silliest of answers get answered in the end! PROLOGUE: This is not a SPOILER. It's an explanation of how things are before the time-line of the movie begins. The setting is 2019. People have gotten richer  of course technology has advanced drastically  and the concept of cloning does exist. Noted celebrities  politicians  sports-persons desire to live a longer life and a career no matter what has to be done. Thus  there are clones created in a remote institute in Arizona run by an English scientist  Merrick. Merrick and his staff basically take a complete scan of the client (called the \""investor\"") and a clone of the same investor is created with the same physical and anatomical  yet closer to perfect  features. However  these clones  or \""insurance policies\"" as they are called  are bred to only be killed eventually for their spare parts - lungs  heart  you name it  to be taken away and given to the investor to live longer. Until their termination time  they are fed on a very strict diet  and are only educated up to the level of a 15 year old. The clones are kept content in their inner lives by being told they were brought to the institute because they were \""contaminated\"" in the real world and were getting cured from the same. They were also promised a lottery where a winner gets to go to the \""Island\"" - where a new world is set to begin  new breeding  no pollution  etc. This is until a flaw occurs in the habilitation process and one product  Lincoln has questions....----------------------------- Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsen were absolutely brilliant in their acting and carried the movie from beginning to the end. I was slightly disappointed when I saw the trailer earlier  and it implied that Scarlett was becoming a blonde bimbo of Hollywood - but I was wrong. She not only had a role to play  but played it well. Hope she becomes the next Hollywood superstar as she is a truly good actress  and charming in her own way.McGregor  on the other hand  carries his post-Star_Wars grace very well  and should be looking for some really dramatic and challenging roles in the near future to get an Oscar or some awards. He is a good actor  and is definitely no James Bond material - too down to earth as an actor (maybe not as a person) to play the cocky British spy. The supporting cast - Michael Clarke Duncan only had a few lines to spare and was a cry baby  but an OK role done. Djimon Honsou - Hollywood's only \""African\"" actor played his role well and gracefully. Steve Buscemi is what one could call a struggling actor. I respect him for trying something new like playing a confused ex-con on a full season of the SOPRANOS - showed his less-comedy side which he portrays in Adam Sandler movies. In the Island  he did sort of fit the role of a crazy techie  but he needs to find something that will bring his recognition back up.Sean Bean  the smooth talking  English villain who played a James Bond baddie too early in his career  also carried his vicious role well. Would have been more appropriate to see an American Southerner play the role of the institute's head-honcho as it was set in Arizona. Overall I gave the movie 8/10. I prefer it to Minority Report  and thank God it was not too hyped!\tIs this the last inhabitable island? A paradise for the lucky few lottery winners?While one may think this is a rip off on some sub part 70's B flick  I get the feeling this is a segway from Logan's Run  THX 1138 and others. The cast is good  the script is good ... along with the story (important) though some action scenes will stretch (and maybe break?) your belief  these transgressions are minor. All action movies have 'reality' issues.I suppose it is fashionable to bash Micheal Bay. I never really paid attention - but I guess  because of the Pearl Harbor disaster (the film with Ben Afleck  not the actual events from December 7th)  people have a deep seated hatred for the director. This hatred is seemingly enhanced by the number of explosions that Bay uses in some of his movies.I think The Island (TI) got a bad rap for product placement. I think this is mostly undeserved. I did think the XBox (live people fighting) was badly placed... it just seemed silly  but other 'placements' seemed very natural - or even funny in a good way. And this leads to the car chase (or one of them). It was much better than the Matrix 2 car chase where all cars seemed to be of a new GM origin and the only cool car was the Camaro (also of GM origin  but at least it had SOME originality). Of course the ads in the movie theater can get annoying ... but that's nothing to do with the movie.I think Bay & Co did a very good job of setting the scene and showing us the human qualities of Jordan and Lincoln. In many ways they seemed more human than the others. Many big questions are raised by this movie and I think many statements are made about the human condition and what people will do to stay alive. How did Lincoln Six Echo develop memories from another person? What kind of influence did the tech/ McCord (played by Steve Buscemi) have on Lincoln. Merrick (Sean Bean) brings up this point  but I think his lack of a real answer makes a bigger statement than anything else.What is real and what is human? What is the nobility of the human spirit ... While these questions are different for everyone I think they are important and should have answers. This movie gives many answers and leaves the right questions.The dialog in TI is good  the actors are good  Scarlet is hot and did well with her role ... I've seen this once and I give it a 9 out of 10.I would go into this movie with as little knowledge about TI  as possible. I would ignore jaded reviewers (professionals who get PAID to review!) who get fussy at the oddest things. I would also ignore the 15 year old retards (is that redundant?) who fail understand that all these ideas are in the public domain and DIRECTORS do not plagiarize (unless they are writers!). I doubt any real 15 year old would get off the Island alive! Maybe the only smart ones are Lincoln & Jordan...MB did a good job. It has a nice build up and then the action is well paced with enough of the old to make the differences stand on their own.\tSo Bay bashers are most likely to find little new to love here  despite the fact that this is a distinctly mature step up in his resume. Argue what you want  but it's hard to dismiss his work as not at least entertaining  if not more than occasionally quite absurd. You see ever dollar up on the screen and every shot looks like it was painstakingly produced (which has also been a regular source of ridicule as well as praise). Forget every other film he's made and let's get to this one.Far more intellectual than what you might expect  don't be surprised if your mind does not occasionally start to dwell on debates of morality and what makes a human being  well  a human being. There are harsh criticisms made about our society and our human nature to the point that you will find yourself demonizing most of the human characters and identifying with the pure  selfless and ideal nature of the protagonists. Our heroes are after all  basically children and therefore have an uncorrupted view of right and wrong  and act on those impulses accordingly. There are some very ugly reminders of what man has been capable in the service of his own selfish objectives  and man's capacity to rationalize the persecution or extermination of other humans and animals as either necessary or because the obstacles are less than human in their eyes. We are quite literally even reminded of the horrors of the Holocaust in a harrowing incinerator scene. We further have our our recall stimulated of another recent act of inhumanity when a major character speaks of a their parents part in resisting the warlords victimizing civilians in Africa. All pretty heavy stuff from the guy who directed the BAD BOY movies. Now  make no mistake  this is still Bay spectacle stuff here  but even much of that has the unique feeling of real and tangible. The cities seem functionaland one conceivable in the near future. There is not a lot of incomprehensible techno jargon to bombard you either. Even the chases  clearly inspired by other action films themselves (even Bay references himself here) seem fresh and clever. It's worth the ticket price. You get some real inner debate and creepy but intelligent suspense and some genuinely exciting chases in a believable futuristic world. If you take healthy doses of THX-1138  LOGAN'S RUN and a better realization of the B Movie FREEJACK (yeah  there's a bit of that movie in here too) and an obscure flick MST3K fans will recognize called CLONUS then you have a pretty good idea what to expect here  and you know what? It ain't bad at all.\tAs a first-time outing without the overadrenalized Jerry Bruckheimer  'The Island' comes off as a well considered project. While few of the ideas posited in this new film are 'new'  Bay and screenwriters Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci have done a more than serviceable job of recycling ideas from other movies that arrived D.O.A.'The Island' is of course a remake of 'Parts:The Clonus Horror'  one of the most sordid of D-grade Mystery-Science Theater 3000 candidates - 'Coma' made on a budget of $350 000. Straight-to-video? Straight-to-the-SciFi Channel? Not even close. Even Albert Pyun never managed to stink 'em up this bad - though he came close  many a time.But I'm supposed to be talking 'The Island' here  and not 'The Clonus Horror'. The Island' is a good movie  built on a solid script  excellent production values and sound performances delivered by A-list actors. As I sat in the theater watching this movie  I found myself going through a mental checklist  \""'Logan's Run'  check. 'The Island of Dr. Moreau'  check. 'Brave New World'  check. 'Revenge of the Sith'  check. There are even shades of 'Total Recall' and 'Gattaca' buried in here  as the film is a dystopia-buried-in-a-futuristic-consumer-fantasy kind of flick. The question remains  though - was this picture brought to fruition by Michael Bay  or just one of the higher-ups at Dreamworks SKG - SKG as in Spielberg  Katzenberg and Geffen.Ewan MacGregor redeems himself here  for the 6 years he spent trying to imitate Alec Guiness in the woebegone 'Star Wars' prequels. There's a wonderful long moment in the film where we're reminded he was once Scottish - 'Shallow Grave'  'Trainspotting' anyone? And OMG! Scarlett Johansson is actually a fairly attractive woman - I really couldn't tell before  with her abused girlfriend and serfdom turns in 'Lost In Translation' and 'Girl with a Pearl Earring'. Again  who knew? But the former Director Bay manages to shine through in some areas  with his signature explosions and oddballs in the supporting cast: Steve Buscemi  showing greater range than evidenced before  demeans himself once again  while Ethan 'Neelix' Philips shows up to disgrace himself as a roly-poly balding-on-top Stryker refugee.For shame! Is it possible to have a Michael Bay movie without cartoonish archetypes? Michael Mann got over it - I suggest that Bay get ahold of the manual and further his attempts at meaningful content. There may be something more memorable than 'Armageddon' or 'Pearl Harbor' in Bay's future. Let's hope that he's able to continue the evolution and that audiences can catch up.\tThis \""film\"" is full of non-stop product placements. The \""action\"" scenes consist of a close up shot of  who knows what  with the camera shaking relentlessly. I must give Bay credit however  because it is obvious that he basically made up the whole movie himself as he went along. His visual style is incredible  if only he would stop cutting every millisecond. The cinematography  especially of Scarlett Johannsen is unbelievable. She looks candy-colored. The contrast of the film every time she is shown is amazing  and the natural lighting is a breath of fresh air. We can see shadows on their faces!There is no chance in hell there was ever a full script for this version of the movie. It seems as if Steve Buschemi's lines were the only ones that they bothered to write down on paper and the rest they made up. The pacing of the film is atrocious. Compare this to even the mediocre film \""Minority Report.\"" At least that film got the viewer into the story with a great opening sequence. The only decent thing about this film is the pro-life and nature vs. nurture messages it forces you to think about in between boring scenes. Also  the white suits shot from above remind me of sperm  and many of the clones are shown in embryo like sacks  violently being cut upon. Much like abortion. The character \""motivations\"" are absolutely laughable. Michael Bay should be ashamed at the way he uses black people in this film. In the extremely unfunny first act  black women and men are used to make \""funny\"" sassy sarcastic jokes. After having a black villain  played by Djimon Hundsou chase down the two leads with black helicopters  fire at them with machine guns relentlessly  and lead groups of men in the process of destroying the city of los angeles  he suddenly becomes a \""good\"" guy. He turns against his employers and decides to help liberate the clones.There is a character who seems to be an overacting Canadian actor hamming it up. He seems to be comic relief  but we all sat through his scenes stone faced. There is one scene where he enters a gas chamber  and panics. Needless to say  it was the best part of the movie. This character IS the movie. When you see him  you understand the tone and the mental age of the script. I remember being 10 years old. This movie was made for eight year olds.Overall  this film is a perfect example of how Hollywood can throw in a bunch of computer graphics and a horrible script and still wonder why they are losing money.\tI didn't believe Michael Bay could come back after making Pearl Harbor (the worst disappointment of my movie watching career)... and god  was I wrong.This movie is a perfect summer flick. It has action  a story that makes sense  high entertainment and... a babe ;-) More seriously  the story is amazing and the acting is pretty good.Many reviewers say that The Island is actually two movies stuck together - one  an exploration of a pretty dim universe and the second  a totally run of the mill action flick. I must agree with that. The first half is a very well made exercise in imagination and set design. The second part suffers from terminal Michael Bay-ism - way too many car chases  way too many explosions  way too many \""boooms  bangs and wowwwwwwws\"".Contrary to many summer movies  The Island does NOT require a major suspension of disbelief: the story really makes sense. I'll try to see other movies written by the same team.The acting is very good. The two principals deliver as well in action scenes than in funny scenes (there are a few :-) Sean Bean plays a variation of his typical bad-guy role but he excels in it. Djimon Hounsou (the other Gladiator :-) is good but he has his ups and lows... Steve Buscemi is  as usual  a genius.The special effects are... too good? Micheal Bay seems to have mastered the art of milking too much money from producers - the car chases scenes are well made and are obviously expensive but they kinda distract from the story line. Personally  i would have removed a good half of them.I didn t notice any major plot holes  besides the fact that the main characters are pretty indestructible... I wouldn't take life insurance on them  it would be a bad bet...There is a lot of product placement in this movie and  at one point  it gets laughable. Watch for a character to be using MSN Search in 2050... Please... Contrary to Minority Report  the cars of the future are not Japanese  there good ole' Cadillacs - I knew the US car industry would come back on top! ;-) Finally  I may buy the soundtrack... The background music is very effective.In summary - an excellent popcorn movie  by a director who delivers the goods.\tTHE ISLAND (2005) ** Ewan McGregor  Scarlett  Johansson  Djimon Hounsou  Sean Bean  Steve Buscemi  Michael Clarke Duncan  Ethan Phillips  Shawnee Smith. Director Michael Bay's hodgepodge futuristic sci-fi action thriller is a patchwork of previous genre plottings including \""THX-1138\""  \""Blade Runner\""  \""Logan's Run\""  \""Gattaca\""  \""Soylent Green\""  \""The Sixth Day\""  \""1984\"" and \""Parts: The Clonus Horror\"" (!) mixed with \""The Fugitive\"" in this relentless cautionary tale about cloning with McGregor and Johansson as clones who discover their world has been one giant lie and decide to escape from their evil creator  Bean (hamming it up big time) to warn the real world about the tampering of humanity. The screenplay by Caspian Tredwell-Owen  Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci attempt to breathe fresh air into a tired sub genre \u0096 the sci-fi morality fable and totalitarian warning of a bleak future with middling results but Bay knows how to keep the pulse quicken with his trademark breakneck editing and pacing particularly in the film's climactic hairy car chase sequence that makes it worth the price of admission to see the carnage on a huge screen. Otherwise it is a forgettable overbaked concoction of corporate misdeeds and misgivings.\tNOTE: Spoilers galore in this post.I was really disappointed with this movie. I was expecting a decent science fiction movie  instead I got a hacked up attempt at a sci-fi action/romance combination  with too many large nitpicks that it spoiled the experience.The story is pretty straight forward. A group of people live in isolation after being told that they are the survivors of some global catastrophe. They a mundane  but secure and physically fit life with promises that they will one day go to The Island  the last Utopian location on the planet. The main character  Lincoln-6-Echo  discovers the horrible truth; the people are in some kind of prison and everything they've been told is a lie. Eventually he escapes with Jordan-2-Delta and they discover that they are really clones of people in the \""real world\"" that use the clones for body parts. They escape are on the run  then eventually return to free the other clones.The movie overall was good  it just had too many plot problem that just nagged on me enough to spoil the movie in general:1) The 2 fugitives escape from the compound with relative ease. Where is the security? How come they are able to walk down a long access bridge to freedom with NO ONE spotting them? They already fought security guards; no one is able to keep tabs on their position? 2) The main characters supposedly have the education of 15 year olds and they supposedly have almost NO knowledge of the \""real world\"". Yet once they get to a train station and then to Los Angeles  they don't seem to have any problems getting around. I mean  they act stupid and don't know phrases like \""the can\""  \""taking a dump\""  \""dude\"" and act incredulous around this. Yet they don't seem to have a problem navigating around a metropolis  which to them would be an alien environment. 3) The main characters get by with 5 movies worth of luck. They dodge trained military personnel. Survive drops from a skyscraper hundreds of feet in the air and manage to take out a helicopter while doing so. They are in a car when it gets totaled (cut in half!!) after getting side-swiped by an armored truck and walk away  not even dazed. I found it hard to empathize with the characters when they were in \""danger\"" because they seemed to be invulnerable! 4) Clones with memories. This is a pet peeve of mine. Memories are NOT a part of a creatures DNA structure. A clone is simply a copy of a creatures physical make up. It cannot have the experience and memories of its donor  because the clone itself hasn't had those experiences or memories. Yet movies frequently portray a clone as not only having the same physical properties as a donor  but the same memories as well. Although  in this movie  the memories were mostly \""subconscious\"". 5) When Jordan was brought back to the institution towards the end  NO ONE thought to search her for a weapon?!! 6) During some of the big action scenes (fighting with the guards while escaping and the big highway chase scene with the flying attack bikes) the camera kept shaking and it was hard to see what the heck was going on. Whats the point of seeing a movie  when the movie *itself* makes it difficult to see what is on the screen?!As the movie went on  these issues just keep accumulating until by the end  I just wanted to see the end.As a side note  I noticed that this movie was almost identical to merging together two other movies: Logans Run and Freejack. The movie has a man and a woman on the run  leaving an isolated society and encountering the world outside  only to return and \""free\"" the people from the society (Logans Run). Meanwhile  they are on the run and hunted down by mercenaries  because their bodies are actually owned by some rich person (Freejack).Overall  I give the movie a 4 out of 10. I would give the movie a 7 out of 10 for just the story  but this is reduced for the annoying issues I mentioned previously.\tVery good movie  reflects my fears of cloning very well  was gritty and somewhat disturbing in parts but needed to be to show how easily cloning can get out of control. The scene where the baby was born was especially disturbing  and so was the incinerator scene near the end. Sean Bean did an excellent job acting playing the bad guy. The various twists in the plot  and the fact that they didn't let the audience in on their plan until later and the twists made it even more fun to watch. The scenes filmed in Detroit were excellent! We had fun watching them film them here in Detroit and I'm amazed how it translated onto the big screen with all the extra buildings and backgrounds added. Very cool.\tFor once  I was glad that I randomly picked a movie at the spur of the moment.I was at the cinema with one of my best friends and three other Chinese friends. The task of picking a movie was assigned to me. But seeing that I haven't been catching up with movies listing for nearly 6 weeks  I found it a tough job. Summer really was deprived of attention-grabbing movie titles. My Chinese friends were turned off by the title of this flick itself  The Island. I mean  seriously  who would want to watch a movie called 'The Island'  especially when they have no idea what is it all about in the first place? If it wasn't for the brief printed summary at the counter  I would not have given this movie a second glance. Like War of The Worlds  its poster was not self-explanatory. Plus  I did not watch the trailer prior to my trip to the cinema.BUT  unlike War of The Worlds (or any other movies before this)  for once I did not question the logic of the flow of the storyline. The storyline was good enough for me to not stop focusing and start being a cynic. At the very least  questions that the average viewer might ask about the plot are answered. It was 100% NOT boring and the plot holes in this movie was subtle because of the relatively fast pace of the story growth. In fact  though I had only watched it once  I don't remember any noticeable loop holes in the storyline. Or questionable action scenes for that matter. I didn't cared if there were futuristic technologies in the movie. After all  the whole thing took place in the future. It was nice that it blended in with the contemporary definitions of the current world  all so that everything seemed viably realistic.Now  there is humor here and there  blended in nicely with action and drama. Noticeable humor genres are satire  sarcasm and banter. The director  Micheal Bay  cleverly played with \""human\"" innocence in the movie. The whole innocence thing somehow reminded me of how complex our minds have made today to be. How open the minds of those \""humans\"" are to different ideas  compared to many of us in reality. Lincoln Six Echo questioned  and that was what made the difference. That manner reminded me of Dead Poets Society  another good movie.Needless to say  Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson complemented each other well. This is the first time I watched Johansson in action  and I must say  her character development as Jordan Two Delta was good. It was more noticeable than McGregor's part. Lincoln Six Echo was depicted as a skeptic to start with  whereas Jordan Two Delta was very innocent. On the other hand  I was quite surprised that McGregor took up this role as I was quite brainwashed with his role as Obi Wan Kenobi in Star Wars and Catcher Block in Down With Love. After all  Lincoln Six Echo is more of a character of innocence  curiosity  and mischief  just like a confused child. Nevertheless  it was a refreshing brilliant performance of McGregor.If I were to complain about anything at all  it would be that I didn't manage to buy popcorn because of the long line at the food counter. I don't think people who are just looking for entertainment with depth would complain about this movie.In conclusion  I definitely want to watch this again.\tThis movie started strong and good. The script was full of suspense and great moments of human nature. Then I'm not sure what happened. It's like a Hollywood exec walked in and said \""where's the explosions?\"" \""where's the unbelievable chase where the two leads come out unscratched?\""Perhaps it's only half a movie. I would love to read the original. I would love to see what the writer intended  because the writer that wrote the first half of this flick did not write the second half.Michael Bay is always filling scripts with action and deleting the story elements that make you think. During the car chase I was thinking  \""god do I have to laundry  when will I actually get to do it.\"" A good flick will not let your mind drift. It will present questions for the viewer and stick with you through the next day. After the this flick we reviewed it at subway  getting dinner and soon dismissed it. The potential this film had was great  and lost it in the Hollywood suffle. Ewan and Johansan are wonderful and so is the rest of the cast. But when you're told to withhold suspension of disbelief  there's only so many close calls you can forgive.\tIs it the writing? The acting? The message? Whatever the reason  I found myself caring right away for the two leads in this involving tale. We first meet Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson as docile members of an idyllic futuristic society. Once the stage is set  the pace picks up as the true nature of their world is revealed  and they take steps to save their own lives and bring justice to their community. White-knuckle chases on every imaginable type of vehicle are anchored by the pair's convincingly rendered transformation to emotional maturity.A sweet love story  a thrilling action picture -- what more could you ask for? Actual thought! In a world facing ethical decisions involvin"
The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004),"Well exactly as my summary says  this is a very well made straight-out unpretentious movie about a fading wildlife-film director's attempt to re-create his past success that made him some sort of cult phenomenon. Reading a few of the other reviews  I think this is evidently a \hate it or love it\"" film  however a lot of people seem to have missed the point-I don't think this film was really intended as a comdey  to me it was more just about the relationships and interactions between the various characters and maybe even an exploration of the human spirit.The motivation for this project is revenge on the \""leopard shark\"" that killed his best friend/long-standing partner and there is a lot of emotion on the way  including an inspiring relationship between him and his long lost son  whom he has never met but was a huge fan of his as a boy  and the constant drama between him and his wife  who's father's money has payed for his entire career.Wes Anderson has excellent cinematography  with some great CGI  depicting marine life in a very retro fashion  and beautiful landscapes  as well as a very well put-together soundtrack including Sigur Ros  The Stooges and Ziggy Stardust era Bowie played in Portuguese with a classical guitar accompaniment. We also see Bill Murray at his best as well as a heart-warming performance by Owen Wilson  who I am not normally a fan of. The script is also very well written and the story is so well put-together that even an attack by pirates or looting a large scientific institution seem plausible in a serious movie about an oceanographer! Overall  this is a brilliant film and there isn't a lot more I can say.\tJudging from previous comments  opinion is divided on this film -- most people seem to love it or hate it...Certainly if you're expecting laugh-out-loud comedy you will be disappointed. The comedy offered here is much more quirky and perhaps even whimsical.And if you're expecting a movie with a brisk pace  you will be forced to change gears and sit back and (hopefully) relax and enjoy. The first hour of the movie is really quite slow.Eventually  though  the somewhat convoluted story-line begins to cut in  and things pick up  until we quite warm to the odd character that is Steve Zissou. In the end we actually empathise with him. (Images of Jacques Costeau also come to mind at several points.) Tasteful renderings of a series of David Bowie songs (many in Portugese) helps the movie along and contributes to its exotic flavour.\t\""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\"" has Wes Anderson's trademark touches smeared all over it--from the eclectic characters unable to express themselves totally  to the musical segues designed to stand in for dialog  to the red beanies and turquoise suits the characters wear. It is also a lot more laid back  which might explain why I enjoyed it more than his previous works--unlike \""Rushmore\"" or \""The Royal Tenenbaums \"" \""The Life Aquatic\"" isn't so enamored of its own preciousness that it becomes a hindrance on the film (too often Anderson seems hell-bent on returning modern cinema back to the innocence and naivet\u00e9 of the 1930s)  and instead plays more raucously  succeeding in spite of its muddled intentions and ridiculous situations (pirates  anyone?). The plot centers around Steve Zissou (an inspired Bill Murray)  a washed-up oceanographer and his band of documentary filmmakers  who set out on the trail of the infamous Jaguar Shark that killed Zissou's partner; also along for the ride is a pregnant reporter (Cate Blanchett) and a man who could be Zissou's son (Owen Wilson). By the end  the to-be-expected emotional encounters have been checked off the list  but the humor is strong and the visuals dynamic. What exists between the beginning and end of \""The Life Aquatic\"" is ultimately rather irrelevant  but the ride is pretty fun.\tI have never been able to not finish a movie...until this one. It was horribly dreadful. The only good thing was that I didn't see it in the theater and waste $30 on movie tickets and another $20+ on snacks and such. Some great names on the film but not near the comic expertise you expect from someone like SNL alum Bill Murray. Plot was insufferable. Could only stand to watch for 30 minutes. Then couldn't take it any more. Even the kids wouldn't finish watching it. Makes me not want to bother with Lost in Translation now. Makes me think twice before going to the theater as well. I would have been horribly disappointed to spend all that dough to just walk out of the theater.\tThis is a VERY strange film. It has some memorable moments  but overall  it doesn't work  probably because it  and the audience  doesn't really seem to know what it actually is.Is it a comedy? It has a few funny bits.Is it a drama? It has a few moments of pathos and some explorations of hero worship  fatherhood  and mid-life crisis.Is it an adventure film? There are a few attempts at excitement that fall curiously flat.Is it a sci-fi/fantasy? Actually it seems pretty rooted in a warped reality  except for the exotic (computer-generated sea creatures.) Is it a satire of documentary film-making? It has several sequences that seem to imply this.Is it an homage to Jacques Cousteau? There are a few moments of admiration for the undersea explorer. (The boat is not called \""The Calypso\"" but \""The Belafonte.\"") Is it a parody of Jacques Cousteau? The fake documentary movie clips seem to be poking fun at the late  great oceanographer.Is it a Bill Murray vehicle? Although Bill Murray is the star  and he is playing the type of laconic cad he has excelled at playing in the past  he seems to be phoning it in here. (I guess he already  more effectively  used up his \""guy-in-his-fifties-experiencing-midlife-crisis\"" shtick in \""Lost in Translation\"".) Overall  like an exploratory ocean journey  this film is all over the map.\tAs THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU opens  we meet famed oceanographer Steve Zissou (Bill Murray)  who is premiering his latest \""adventure\"" to an audience in France. During this recent expedition  a member of the crew  Esteban (Seymour Cassel)  is killed by what Zissou contends to be a \""jaguar shark.\"" When asked if he will continue to seek this mystical creature  he states that he is going to find it and kill it. From the brief description above  it may be hard to imagine these opening scenes as being humorous  but they are. They also serve as the spark point for the \""plot\"" of THE LIFE AQUATIC  which is the latest surreal comedic drama from director Wes Anderson  who has taken as his inspiration the films of Jacque Cousteau. Now I have put the word plot in quotation marks because most of the sequences in AQUATIC serve as vignettes  each with distinct internal stories  that in an indirect way advance the actual story (the quest for the shark). This is made all the more apparent by brief interludes of a crew member  played by Seu Jorge  performing David Bowie tunes in french. These scenes with Jorge (who also translated the songs) serve almost like a curtain in a play  something that obscures the transition to the next act. This theatrical tone is also present in the large cross section mock-up of the ship which Anderson uses for more lengthy tracking shots (which would have been impossible on a real ship). This is the technique that is employed as the ship is explored and the crew introduced: Eleanor Zissou (Angelica Houston)  Steve's wife and the \""brains of the operation\""; Klaus Daimler (Willem Dafoe)  a German seaman with emotional problems; Vladimir Wolodarsky (Noah Taylor who was great in SHINE) is the communications/radar operator who also composes the music for the Zissou films using two small Casio keyboards (AQUATIC's actual score  by Mark Mothersbaugh  is wonderfully cheesy); various members of the underwater camera crew and the ship's \""interns\"" who are put to manual labor and other unpleasant tasks. There are also many subplots: one involving Zissou's producer  Oseary Drakoulias (Micheal Gambon)  who continues to have problems generating funds for the antiquated cinematic adventures of the fading oceanographer. There is also Zissou's rivalry (both professionally and personally) with a well financed \""corporate\"" explorer (Jeff Golblum). Jane (Cate Blanchett)  an attractive reporter  joins the crew to write a story about the ship's exploits. She ends up falling for Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) who may or may not be Zissou's biological son.As you can probably deduce  THE LIFE AQUATIC has a vast array of story lines and characters. It is for this reason that the actual plot (shark revenge) is kept open and abstract. Anderson is more concerned with the interplay of the large cast than with any linear progression of the story. It is this fragmented style that allows the film to diverge in many bizarre directions. The humor of AQUATIC is very dry and self-effacing  which helps in the transitions from wacky physical humor to warmhearted drama to fairly graphic violence. It is actually the scenes involving foreign pirates who hijack Zissou's ship  and the subsequent resolution during a rescue operation  where I laughed the most. I'm not sure what that says about me  per se  but it is to Anderson's credit that such episodes do not sabotage the entire film. That said  the unevenness of the events feel somewhat disjointed at times and if a viewer does not accept Anderson's sly tongue-in-cheek humor  THE LIFE AQUATIC could give the aesthetic of a jumbled mess. One has to  in a certain sense  \""dive\"" into AQUATIC  suspending disbelief and rolling with the choices the director has made. I do respect the film for taking chances and not pandering to popular taste  but for a production that received such a large theatrical release it would seem to have somewhat limited appeal. THE LIFE AQUATIC seems to be continuation of director Wes Anderson's overall vision. The one thing that it does suffers from is that his previous film  THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS  was damn near perfect. To make such a film so early in one's career  means that all others will be measured against that high-water mark. Now this is  admittedly  unfair but I am going to do it anyway. AQUATIC lacks the chemistry in the cast of THE ROYAL TENEBAUMS (or RUSHMORE for that matter)  which makes this large ensemble piece feel a bit clunky. Anderson seemed more sure of who to use and when for the right effect in TENEBAUMS. This was helped by an extraordinary central performance by Gene Hackman who was much more giving and low key in contrast to Bill Murray. Murray is good  but has a performance style that is somewhat distracting. Actually many of the leads (Murray  Defoe and Goldblum included) each have such a distinct presence that they don't blend as smoothly into the larger work. Wilson  Blanchett  Gambon  and particularly Angelica Houston  seem to understand the dynamic better. They downplay their parts  which is especially crucial in the oddly sweet relationship between Jane and Ned. THE LIFE AQUATIC takes a while to get going  but in the end  I enjoyed the film. There are many memorable moments and clever asides and I applaud the filmmakers for using stop-motion animation (produced by Henry Selick of NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas fame)  not CGI in the creation of the film's many whimsical sea creatures. It is Wes Anderson's knack for character design and ultimately his (borderline obsessive) attention to the smallest details that continue to make his films a rewarding experience. 7/10\tTo enjoy this movie you basically have to throw away your sense of reality. I got this for my birthday just a little while ago; I did plan on seeing it so that worked out nicely. Steve Zissou is a washed up oceanographer who makes documentaries and swears revenge upon a mythical jaguar shark that ate his friend right in front of him. The main idea of the story is to invoke revenge upon the jaguar shark (i.e. blow it up). Right in the beginning we're introduced to Ned  who may or may not be Steve's son. Steve ends up taking him under his wing and makes him a part of Team Zissou. Together possible father and possible son hunt the jaguar shark. The over all movie does concentrate on the hunt  even though at some points it really doesn't seem like it. The movie isn't laugh out loud funny either. The movie does have a few humorous scenes  but not enough to make it an extremely funny movie. The overall story is good  and at some points surprising  even a little dramatic. I recommend it to most people.\tPerfection. The timing of the jokes on and off screen would make you dizzy. The Tennebaums was slow and building to the finale. Whereas Zissou hits you like a rocket from the moment you see Murrays eyes after his friend was attacked.The subtlty of some of the jokes is the sign of genius.This is now in my top 5 favorite movies along with the outstanding Big Lebowski and Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. It maybe regarded as a comedy but the devoplement of the character and the arc they complete does leave you feeling that you know the players. Hats off to Mr Dafoe for his best role since Nosferatu .A true find .....\tThis movie is amateurish in design and execution.Poorly filmed and edited with no plot and not funny. The jokes were so low key that they barely registered. The actors were great though considering the rubbish they had to work with. Bill Murray was terrific.I rented the DVD and after 10 minutes watching it I had to stop  the last time I did that was with Mulholland Dr. The next day I gave it a second chance and watched the whole thing. I came to the same conclusion as previously  it stank.The film was a giant self indulgence by Wes Anderson. I am sure he found it hilarious and funny but he has to consider a wider audience. The film must have been a financial disaster. The fact he has only made four films in ten years is no accident  I cannot see him making four more in the next ten years. He is now on my directors to avoid list with David Lynch.\tDidn't like Rushmore; found Tennembaums unengaging. Loved this film. Clearly  it's not for everyone. You have to like offbeat  under the radar (and well over the radar) type of humor like Steve Odekerk (the thumb series and Kung Pow)... Oddly  I enjoyed every minute of it  OK maybe not every... but what a well built off kilter structure Mr Anderson built  like one of those naive visionary sort of sculptures that the city can't decide to tear down (dangerous  ugly to some) or make into a theme park. Thank the gods that people other than Woody Allen (some of whose films I can watch more than once... the \""funny ones\""...) are taking this auteur thing seriously. I wish people would leave more recommendations on these comments. So much more useful than grousing.\tThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou tells the tale of a Jaques Costeu-like figure whose best days are behind him  doing one more perhaps pointless voyage before calling it a day. For me any film with Bill Murray is usually going to be good because if for no reason other than that he can make an average film work. Owen Wilson  Willem Dafoe  Anjelica Huston  Jeff Goldblum and others are also thrown into the mix and by most standards this film has a pretty good cast. I see this film as being the sort of film that works on many subliminal levels  there's a lot to chew on and it's the sort of film that leaves an impression (on me at least).The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou has a fairly unique story  a lot happens  in an unpredictable fashion and Zissou goes out on a high note probably more through luck than anything else. I quite enjoyed the film although the only thing I didn't get while watching was why deliberately fake-looking seas creatures were used  but it went with the cartoonish air of the film in general.I'm surprised to see a lot of people have reacted adversely to the film but I expect that's a result of people having expectations that they'll be seeing a regular comedy and have those expectations unfulfilled. This film works on more of a personal level  on the level of relationships between people and what point they're at in life. This is the best new release I've seen in a while so don't expect a film engineered for laughs and enjoy the film.\tI just saw it  and it's late  so I can't be very expressive. But I thought it is an excellent movie. There is so much woven into it  I'm sure it's going to be worth seeing again and again. I think it was well written and edited too; everything all worked together. Despite some common themes  there was so much unexpected too  which doesn't happen much. I just loved the subtle  subtle life-like humor. I'm surprised the critical community didn't pick up on it more. I bet it did well in Europe. The actors balanced each other well. I liked the fact that I rarely was thinking \""This is a Bill Murray movie\"" or \""I'm watching Owen Wilson.\"" No one was drawing attention to themselves; they were all totally telling a story. I think the disconnect from the characters that many of us feel in the beginning is deliberate. I think the director wants us to feel as dubious about the protagonist as he is feeling about himself. I'm not familiar with Wes Anderson's work  but now I want to be. Such a funny  thoughtful  funny movie.\tThis movie was pure artistic masturbation. What a waste of an incredible cast. It's made for a very specific group of fans of which I am clearly not one of them. It's like pseudo-famous artist sticking a piece of chewing gum on the bottom of a sneaker  showing it in a gallery and expecting people to say it's brilliant when it's nothing but gum on a shoe. Then the artist comes out and talks about how the gum represents humanity and the shoe represents materialism and you're supposed to go \""Ohhhh... now I get it... how profound  how interesting\"" when all you really want to do is go to the bathroom and leave. Meanwhile  the artist is smoking with satisfaction at having once again made a fortune off so much crap as gum on a shoe.\tI have no idea what other people saw in this movie. I had 4 half hearted chuckles during the whole thing.I like the actor's that were in the movie but I wonder why they signed on for it. Maybe this movie is too sophisticated for me. Maybe I am not cultured enough for it. Maybe is just sucked. Yeah let's go with that.The acting was horrible  the story dumb and the funny bits were very very sparse.Does nobody read scripts?It sucked.Save your money and watch something else.\tI was a big fan of Anderson's Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums  but Life Aquatic was pretty average. Its flaws are pretty easy to pick out. The film is too long and predictable  and not very exciting. The dark humor and drama from Anderson's earlier works are missing. The pirates in the movie didn't seem to have much of a motive (except that there would have been even less story without them kidnapping someone for the crew to rescue)  and there were too many characters (why was Jeff Goldblum even in this movie?). The one thing a movie like this would have had going for it was the laugh department  but sadly  it didn't deliver much there. There was a lot of potential in this flick  but in the end  it didn't amount to much. I wouldn't really recommend it unless you're a die-hard Anderson fan.\tReally wanna forget this one  but it was soooooo disappointing  I can't quit thinking about it! My biggest problem - my husband won't ever go see another Bill Murray film after this. The promo photo on the DVD cover was the perfect depiction of the audience response. New definition of DEAD-PAN. It was DEAD and I have to PAN it.I've never had trouble sleeping  but... this film is perfect for those who do!! At least I've gotten some pleasure from reading the Love/Hate comments. But... Great!??? Certainly not in the eye of this beholder.\tGenerally intended to be a campy satire. But it seems to me that they just wouldn't go far enough in that direction. That's OK  since that sort of movie is really hard to pull off. So  there were a hodgepodge of other dramatic and comedic elements. It was  at least  reasonably original  and deserves some credit for that. Can't really say that much about the acting. Nobody really stood out. It was all competent and professional  at least for this sort of film. There were a number of amusing running jokes  such as the fake marine life  the way the crew went about casually armed  Anne-Marie (Robyn Cohen) frequently hanging about topless for no obvious reason  and the Brazilian crew member often playing guitar  and singing David Bowie songs in Portuguese. Overall  I say it's worth checking out.\tI just rented \""The Life Aquatic\"" on DVD last night. I had high hopes for this movie. Bill Murray is one of my favorite actors. I love his earlier comic work; Groundhog Day is my favorite movie ever and Murray's performance is what gives that movie its magic. Murray also has been impressive in less comedic roles lately. Lost in Translation was a very well done and poignant film. Based on the previews  TLA looked like an off-beat comedy - perfect for someone like Murray  I thought.The rest of the cast is also impressive. Anjelica Houston and Cate Blanchett are both very talented actresses. Heck  I even don't mind Owen Wilson; I think he's kind of cute. With a cast like that  TLA had so much potential to be great. What a disappointment it turned out to be.As I mentioned earlier  the previews for TLA gave the impression that it would be a comedy  albeit a little weird. This is very misleading. The film is not funny - it is not a comedy and it isn't clear what exactly the film is supposed to be. Is it art house? Drama? Comedy? All three? I couldn't tell because TLA does all these things so poorly. It jumps from one boring  unfunny scene to another. There is little sense of connection between the scenes. The plot is nonexistent. Now I don't mind minimal plot movies. Lost in Translation barely had a plot  but it was still a great movie because of the characters. In TLA the characters are terrible. You do not get to know the characters and subsequently you just don't care about them. A real shame  considering the talented cast. Bill Murray brings none of his talents to his character - watching Steve Zissou is about as interesting as watching paint dry. Murray looks like he's bored by playing this part - perhaps he already knew during filming that this movie would be such a stinker.Overall this movie is a great disappointment and a waste of time. I cannot believe it is getting such high ratings from IMDb users.\tI saw this movie with high expectations. Having never seen any of Wes Anderson's films but hearing wonderful things about them  I thought that The Life Aquatic would be superb. For lack of a better term  I was disappointed. Perhaps it was because I was unfamiliar with Anderson's style or because I simply wasn't in the mood. What didn't I like too much? First off  the humor. It was WAY too smug. Much of it wasn't really laugh-out-loud hilarious  or it was just really dull. Perhaps all of Anderson's films are like this  but I was hoping for some great laughs. To me  this movie was a better film about the relationship between Steve and his son (played by Owen Wilson).Next  I'd have to say the pacing. Some really long stretches of time are kind of boring and lifeless. I know many people are going to disagree with me  but I was constantly checking my watch to see how much longer I'd have to sit through.Even though there were aspects (mind you  big ones) of the film that were good. Let me start off by saying that the cast is perfect. Murray  Wilson  Cort  Goldbloom  Dafoe  and Blanchette all give wonderful performances. The cast is pretty much perfect. Owen Wilson and Bill Murray work together amazingly as father and son who see things very much differently.The imagery in the film is also pretty wonderful. The look of the sea life is all very creative and cool  and I really liked the style of the art direction.The end of the film: wonderful. As Steve sees the jaguar shark that killed his best friend  he has a change of heart. Astounded by its beauty  he can't bring himself to slay it as he had set out to do. This moment is amazing  and Sigur Ros provides for some moody but hauntingly lovely music (Star\u00e1lfur is the name  I recommend you download it). At that moment  the film actually kind of fulfilled my expectations.Then again  I hear that this film gets better with multiple viewings. Perhaps someday I might watch it again and I might agree with moviegoers who adored it.\t\""The Life Aquatic\"" has an odd storyline  plucked from Wes Anderson's and Noah Baumbach's heads  filled with ocean life and soap opera-potential relationships. Anderson's \""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\"" contains all elements of his style reminiscent of his \""The Royal Tenenbaums\"".His characters are surreal but still believable. Bill Murray  Owen Wilson and Cate Blanchett give great performances  probably in part due to Anderson's good rapport with actors. I felt that the movie kept me floating from one scene to another in dream-like motion. His dialogue is never pretentious or contrived  leaving the film with a fresh edge."""
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003),"When I went to see this movie  I had high expectations because I saw the other two Lord of the Rings movies and thought they were both amazing. But when I saw this movie I was in awe. This film went way beyond my expectations. There aren't enough words in the English language that could describe how good this movie is. It's just incredible!! This also marks the first time that I have ever cried in a movie theater. And I am not a person who usually cries during a movie.Out of the three Lord of the Rings movies  this one is the best by far. It is currently sitting at #4 on the top 250 here at IMDb. However  I think this movie should be #1 by a few miles. It is just so good. I can't understand how any other movie could be better. This is definitely a movie that everybody on Earth should see at some point in their lifetime. Yeah it's that good!! 10/10\tWhen I got out of college  books of fantasy were what my friends and I were fascinated with. The number one book was JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit. We read and discussed this book as well as the Trilogy over coffee and tea  arguing and challenging one another about the truth of the story.Fast forward 30 years and word came out that a movie  or actually a trilogy of movies about the books would be coming out. Excitement increased as the time for the first movie to be unveiled. My husband could hardly wait for this  he was such a Tolkien fan  he named his dog  Frodo.Would the movie do justice to the book? Would it stay true to the story? In my opinion  it not only did both  but enhanced my vision of how the story should be told.The characters were more real  the scenery incredibly vivid. The only problem I had with the movies was how strong the images of the nasty creatures were. I wanted to go back to the cozy hobbit holes in the Shire.While my husband enjoyed all three movies  I found I liked the first one better than the second. But when the third one came out  I was in tears at the end. The emotions I felt surprised me.Peter Jackson accomplished something everyone said could never happen.. translating Tolkien's world of Middle Earth on to film. What was a dream world became reality.\t...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson  the director behind the \goriest movie ever made\"" (1992's \""Dead Alive\"")  would have been behind the epic three-film installment of \""The Lord of the Rings\"" saga  which include \""The Fellowship of the Ring\"" (2001)  \""The Two Towers\"" (2002)  and Best Picture Oscar-winner \""The Return of the King\"" (2003).***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies  as it will be posted at each individual web page.Not since \""Star Wars\"" has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books  though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing \""The Lord of the Rings\"" films. \""The Lord of the Rings\"" is the biggest movie I've ever seen  and there's a whole lot of story  12+ hours to be exact  and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which  in my view  do push the limits of the \""PG-13\"" rating)  not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is  and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing  epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get \""into\"" Jackson's vision of Middle-earth  and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies  you feel like you're really there  with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too  with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and \""The Enemy \"" who include the brutish Orcs  Moria Orcs  Ringwraiths  and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly  the cast does much more than bring the action to life  but instead live (\""live\"" is italicized) their parts. Of course  I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin)  who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way  two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd)  necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen)  warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen)  Boromir (Sean Bean)  elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom)  and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a \""fellowship of the ring.\"" There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett  Ian Holm  Christopher Lee  Liv Tyler  Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy)  and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material  despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called \""The Lord of the Rings\"" the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right.10/10\tTo fully appreciate the greatness of this movie particularly and the trilogy as a whole  you have to watch the extended version of it. I saw it on TV first and then got the extended version and since that  every time I watch the standard version it seems like a compact version of the real thing. The regular version is amazing but the addition of some important (at least for me) scenes makes it the best movie of all times.This is by far the best of the three because of the fact that it had to tie all the ends and finish the story and at the same time be bigger and more intense that it's predecessors.While I still think that the last 15 minutes of two towers is one of the greatest masterpieces in the history of mankind  you'll never be disappointed in this one. The trilogy itself is just so deep and so perfect  that it's one of those things that make you think about the beautiful things humanity is capable of.\tMr. Jackson has created the perfect ending to an amazing adaptation of the classic literary masterpieces. He has taken an unmanageable array of literary devices and narratives to present us with incredible visual passages  emotional journeys  and seamless blends of new technology and old-fashioned storytelling.Just like its two previous chapters  RTOK is of epic proportions. With the assistance of adept editors  the different story lines are integrated and keep us engaged for nearly 4 hours. We get to the rewarding payoff where all will be resolved.ROTK is a nearly perfect film  and some people might argue that its various endings might lessen the impact of its conclusion. It's hard to walk away from such magnificent storytelling with a simple ending. It's at least interesting to at least explore the many possibilities that such a tale might lead us to.\tWow! What is their to say about such a deeply layered and inspiring movie. The action is intense. The dialog feels completely real. The movie is made in such a way that even though there is absolutely no way it could be real  you feel sucked right into it. If I'm going to review this movie I'm going to have to start with the acting which in my opinion completely makes this movie great and will be the component that holds it together as a masterpiece far into the future. Sean Astin is the highlight of the film as Samwise Gamgee(A trustworthy hobbit who protects Frodo.) His acting is brilliant. He makes you care so much for the character that you are actually rooting for him and against Frodo for a part of this film. When Frodo tells Sam to go home you feel betrayed right along with Sam. You want to share his tears. Next in the acting lineup is Andy Serkis' amazing portrayal of Gollum. I do not understand why people find this character annoying. To me he is the best skitzophrenic ever put on film. Although his part is slightly smaller in this movie then the Two Towers  the acting and achievement of Gollum are nothing short of awe-inspiring. Although Elijah Wood's Frodo plays a supporting role to Sean Astin's Sam he is still breath-takingly real in his performance of Frodo. You can literally feel the weight on his shoulders as he edges towards Mordor. I have only begun to name the tremendous performances in this film. Ian Mckellan's Gandalf will probably go down as one of the legendary film characters and that is not due to the actions of the character  but the subtle expressions that come over Gandalf's face in the middle of intense conflict. There is a scene played with Gandalf and Billy Boyd's Pippen right before a gate is going to come crashing down because of the Dark Lord Sauron's army. The writing in this scene and the performances exploring life after death are nothing if not perfect. John Noble plays the very messed up Denthor to near perfection. All of the performances in my opinion were Oscar-worthy and the only reason they did not get nominated was that there were too many great performances to pick from. Among the best of the performances however is Miranda Otto's portrait of Eowyn  where she displays strength  grace  beauty  intelligence  and a desire for something more then she has with awesome depth. Now I have finished talking about the acting which highlights the film. Unlike most Hollywood blockbusters the effects are not the story but just a part of it. The effects are nothing if not extraordinary. The Battle of Pellenor Fields is the greatest battle ever put to film. Peter Jackson obviously had a passion for the books and it shows. What I'm trying to basically say is that the Lord of the Rings the Return of the King deserved its 11 Oscars very much and it is in my opinion the greatest film of all time.\t'Win a Date with Tad Hamilton' is undoubtedly a chick-flick and  yes  it's fairly predictable  but I would recommend it to anyone because it's a fantastic way to spend an hour and a half. It's impossible not to get caught up in the cheeriness of it all and smile along with the characters. Plus  much of the comedy is hilarious  especially Topher Grace's semi-cynical one-liners and Sean Hayes' spoilt moments.Also  you get to see both Topher Grace and Josh Duhamel topless. And chopping wood.'Win a Date with Tad Hamilton' doesn't have a huge message to put across  nor does it have multi-million dollar special effects or incredibly famous actors  but it's what I would call a 'happy film'. If you're expecting a piece of ground-breaking drama you'll be sadly disappointed  because that isn't what this film is supposed to be. It's entertainment in the purest form possible  because it simply entertains you.I can see why this film might be susceptible to criticism about the plot - boy-meets-girl  girl-meets-other-boy  etc. - but I don't think that the acting and the script can be faulted. The film is funny and well-paced  with both physical and verbal comedy  attractive and cheerful leads and an overwhelming sense of happiness throughout.And I don't mind admitting that I laughed all the way through and cried at the end.\tJust by saying its the greatest action film of all time  then breaking for lunch  doesn't do it justice. It was the best film  not only of 2003  but in years.A stunning endingThe ending is so spectacular  Frodo's climb up Mt. Doom with Sam and the ring is a masterpiece of a scene  as well as the battle inside the mountain and the finale afterwords.Great battle scenesthe Battle of Minas Tirith may be the most intense battle scene since the beginning of Saving Private Ryan.Even a little scaryGollum is frightening with his multiple personalities  as well as the intense battle with Shelob the Spider and Aragorns meeting with the ghosts.All in allA spectacular film  visually amazing  and even good acting  which you don't see in films like these **** out of ****\tThis movie is a pain.Simply horrible  boring  too long  bad acting  bad writing.Pratically i don' t save nothing of this pile of garbage.The fake-looking special effects are some of the worst i have ever seen.The sad thing is that this overrated turkey won so many Oscar:quite a testament of the low level of the academy awards.Terrible.The editing is a complete mess  the only saving grace are the wonderful New Zealnd landscapes.How many ending it had? 10  20  come on  it's simply laughable.In conclusion  a very bad and overrated movie.Another thing:this movie is number 3 of all the time? IMDb webmaster  it's time to change the IMDb vote modalities.\tThis movie is phenomenal. The depth and substance that is conveyed in this film immerses you so deep into Middle-Earth  both visually and emotionally  that the viewer cannot help but feel some sense of attachment to this place  as if it had once truly existed.The most genius moment of the entire trilogy of movies is the scene \""The Finding of the Ring.\"" Played out as a sort of prologue to The Return of the King  it's a bold move on Peter Jackson's part that he should start his 3rd movie by telling back-story  rather than re-hashing what has already been established in the previous films. It shows not only Jackson's confidence in the continuity of his story and the substance of the character of Sm\u00e9agol/Gollum  but it also shows his confidence that the audience will allow him liberties with the structure of the plot  that a flashback doesn't necessarily have to be placed into context before it appears to be fully comprehended.One production element of these three movies that makes Middle-Earth seem so tangible is Peter Jackson's apprehension towards using CGI models except where truly necessary. Scale models and half-sets were used in places where most director would simply shoot 100% computer generated sets with bluescreens. And while it doesn't afford the technicians the absolute freedom and ease that a complete virtual world provides  the time and effort spent doing miniatures is rewarded ten-fold on screen. I know it's clich\u00e9  but if you compare LOTR to Star Wars in terms of how special effects were shot  you can see that 100% CGI shots would have likely ruined the enchantment of the films: The original Star Wars trilogy was shot using miniatures for effects shots as there were no rendering computers in existence during its production. And while computers would have been nice to smooth over some of the bluescreening and stop-action issues  in the end everything appears very fluid  organic  and real. But once the pre-quils were shot  the technology was there to do almost all effects production on computers. However  Lucas continually abuses the technology and the effects ultimately convey very rigid lighting against only semi-realistic elements and ultimately the visuals subtract from the story because they stand out so substantially. LOTR's effects blend seamlessly into all the other elements of the movie because they don't scream \""fake\"" like Lucas's  but rather whisper \""this is no less real than your mind will make it.\"" Miniatures and partial sets may seem like a step backward in terms of technology  cost  and time  but it can be argued that this was one of the many decisions that ultimately gave the films their pristine artistic quality.This is only a segment of a much larger essay that I wrote in the process of writing this review. There is so much more to say about this movie and it's predecessors that could never fit in this context. Just trust me when I say that this is the most impressive  memorable  and ultimately rewarding movies that I've seen.\tI has been a several years now since visual effects impressed the audience into marking a movie great. Since the computer generated effects for Jurassic Park in 1994  gradually it has become a standard for all movies.Even comedies now are expected to use respectable visual effects. Of course  now we are used to computer animations. The first Matrix had us drooling on the new 360 degrees visual effect. Now I don't think anyone is impressed by it.I think this is good. Because sometime after the start of this new millennium  big movie studio executives still think special effects will push a movie to the top in the box office. Not anymore. The Lord of the Rings is faithfully based on a master piece of literature. Tolkien dedicated a lifetime in creating this book. It would be great for a writer to continue on his work. To add-on the ages to after the Lord of the Rings.In conclusion  Definitely we have to expect great stories backed by great special effects  not the other way around.\tI lost more than three hours in my life watching this crap I'm really STUNNED of the ratings  the Oscars  and the millions of dollars this movie generated.The story: It was clear from the first part what is going to happen! no need to waste your money on two towers and the return of the king.The acting  to be fair  most of the cast held their own  but the problem was that the worst actor got the biggest share: Elijah Wood! come on! that puppy face might have worked when you were three  but here  it is really over used and not at all convincing.Pace: at the beginning its good  then it slows down until it reaches the snail speed at about two hours left to the movie ending. I mean...COME ON! was the last 40 minutes even necessary? Special effects: they are the only reason why I didn't give the movie 1 star.Directing: AN Oscar!!!! I'm surprised he didn't get a razzie! I mean come on  the pace was totally unrealistic  one universe  people are gathering troops and fighting then gathering some more then running then doing all sorts of stuff and fighting some more  and in a a parallel universe  the stupid Frodo is only climbing a mountain from beginning of the movie till the end! Another stupid thing was when he brought in children in some takes and shoot them from behind to show that they are Frodo and his midget friends  then in the next take a frontal view of Frodo and his gang  the scenes appeared really stupid and challenged how much a viewer can numb his mind. The director was NOT convincing.To be fair  it is a hard film to direct  but that should have made the lame Peter Jackson leave the task with someone more capable.All in all: crap.\tlike I wrote in my summary: I didn't like the movie because it was too long-winded. if it would have a duration time of about 1 hour and 45 minutes I would have probably given it a 8 or higher. it's the same with the other parts of this trilogy  all were too long. I think I liked the first one the most because of the new characters and a relative fast storyline. I never read the book  maybe that's why I was bored watching this movie.... I have had a discussion with a friend once  he liked it very much  he gave it an 9 or 10 but he has read the book  he told me that it was a great translation to the big screen  I can't compare it in that way. action  atmosphere creation and characters were excellent though!\tPeter Jacksons Best work so far! The depth in the relationship of the fellowship continues to fall apart as Frodo and Sam Reach their destination; I liked the sense of compassion between each of the characters although they weren't always with each other. Although the book is more Intriguing the way the screenplay was composed worked perfectly! This excellent work of art lives up to its reputation with its amazing 11 academy award winning Oscars! With more pain  suffering  and loss throughout the story  the actors deliver a powerful sense of their characters with their talents. In my opinion this is my favorite out of the three part trilogy!!!\tThere is no argument that this was the best movie of 2003. It got 11 academy awards which is what it definitely deserved. I saw this movie opening day with a couple friends and we were all very happy with it. It is a great conclusion to the trilogy and the visuals and special effects are better than in fellowship and the two towers. The battle of minas tirith is probably the most awesome battle I've ever seen in a movie before.The story was wonderful and picks up right where the two towers left off and does it great job of actually moving the story along with really good pacing. The plot is great just like the first two. The acting is really good as well. Frodo starts going down hill since the ring is taking him over and he does a great job of acting in the evil kind of way. Andy Serkis as gollum is wonderful just like in the two towers. The movie is probably the most dramatic out of the three movies and it's not melodrama or corny drama  it's actually good and very well done in the conclusion of the movie.The movie runs for 3 hours and 20 minutes. The only minor complaint I have toward this movie in the ending. It was dragged on for a little bit too long and I also thought mordor could have looked a little better when Frodo and Sam finally reached it. It should have looked like how it looked in the first two movies with it's scorching red sky and a dark dark land of mountains with thunder and lightning that looks crazily good. In return of the king  mordor looked more like a night time on a cloudy day. Maybe it's a sign of Sauron loosing power. Who knows. These are just minor complaints that don't take away any of my likings for this movie. Most people would say this was the best out of the trilogy. I personally like them all three of them the same though. These are my favorite movies of all time and it's probably not about to change.\tCan't understand why people like this dull movie. It has boring predictable characters  pretty bad acting. Paper thin personalities  if your bad then your gonna do evil stuff all the time and if your good well u get the point. Even if u haven't't read the book u can figure out whats going to happen 10 min or so in to the movie. 3 hours long  nothing really going on except Frodo almost dying a few times but of course saved in the last minute. Sam having his little annoying speech thats suppose to be heartwarming or something. 3 hours? they could've cut it to 2 and that would be more then enough. I dread the directors cut. Sure it has its moments but come on people! Is this movie really better than Pulp Fiction  The Pianoist  American Beauty etc etc etc?.\tFollowing on from The Two Towers  J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord Of The Rings saga concludes as Frodo  Sam and Gollum near the end of their quest at Mount Doom  Aragorn  Legolas and Gimli raise a spirit army and Gandalf and the men of Rohan fight to protect the ancient city of Minas Tirith from Sauron's monstrous orc army.Jackson's epic-to-end-all-epics comes to a breathtaking conclusion  maintaining the incredibly high standards set by the previous two movies in terms of its technical excellence and eye-popping imagery  but also heightening the dramatic intensity of the story and the characters to unprecedented levels. There is so much happening in this movie it is easy to get dumbstruck by the sheer visual excess (at least an hour of running-time is taken up with the Minas Tirith battle-scenes alone) but the movie is also filled with fine acting (particularly Wood  Astin  McKellen and Serkis) and many great heartfelt scenes - Faramir's disillusionment with his father  Theoden's death  Frodo's reunion with Gandalf  the return to Bag End. Like all great epics  the film is an incredibly intimate character study set against the grandest backdrop imaginable. Jackson has achieved a minor miracle; he has filmed an unfilmable book  and not only done it justice in emotional terms  but produced stunning visuals which convert Tolkien's fabulously imaginative and original prose into equally hypnotic and entrancing images. A classic film to end a classic movie trilogy  which will entertain generations to come.\tThere is no epic like The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. I have never had a better time seeing this movie in theaters. This breathtaking epic  is the third and last installment in The Lord of the Rings. Sam and Frodo are closer and closer to the cracks of Doom while their journey becomes very dangerous along with their guide Gollum helping. Meanwhile the rest of the fellowship try to stop Sauron's army from taking the ring. The movie is pure magical from beginning to end and the characters are all wonderful. Return of the King went very fast for a three and a half hour movie  mostly because I loved it. I have become very obsessed with the trilogy and if you loved the first two Lord of the Rings  you will definitely love the last one as well.Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+\tPeter Jacksons' first major task was to make Lord of the Rings into one film. \""Impossible\""  Peter Jackson said  there was no way he could fit all the information into one film. But one of the producers in New Line Cinema said why not make three films because there is three books. It was exactly what the crew making the film wanted to hear. So then the scripts were re-writ to fit three films. After the theatrical release  director Peter Jackson wanted to create an extended version for each film. This was because Peter Jackson wanted to capture it for posterity.The Lord of the Rings was a cinematic masterpiece  the greatest book of the 20th Century was made into the greatest film trilogy of the 21st Century.The end of the trilogy is here and what a way to end it. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King deserved an academy award  but it won 11 out of a possible 14  that's a phenomenal record. The journey ends as Aragorn  Legolas  Gimli  Merry and Pippin fight to defend Gondor  the white city. And all journey's come to a successful conclusion  as all the survivors from the battle of the Pellanor Fields go to the Black Gate to give Frodo and Sam one last chance to destroy the One Ring. Great film  Peter Jackson has made a fantastic series  with the help of the film-making crew. the trilogy will be remembered for decades to come.\tWhen I saw the first film I fell in love with LOTR and quickly read the books  which were amazing. I couldn't wait for the second and third instalments in the trilogy and they didn't disappoint!this story picks up where the two towers left off as we follow Frodo and Sam on the journey to mordor  accompanied by Andy Serkis' Gollum (who is superb).Also you see how Aragorn journeys to try and reclaim the throne of gondor and gandalf battling to save Minas Tirith. Though not everything in the book is included Peter Jackson has done the best he possibly could and quite frankly it is unbeatable  i would argue with anyone who said this film isn't Oscar worthy and not a great epic never to be forgotten.the special effects are amazing  the best to date  and the acting is good and emotional all round  Viggo Mortensen  Ian McKellan and Sean Astin give stirring performances. The battle sequences must be the best ever filmed as many a critic has said and i agree. They are mostly computer-generated but are still awesome  i loved the Mumakil (Oliphonts).Though this is your good old good vs. evil it isn't too predictable and even the multiple endings aren't out of place. As the tag line goes 'there is no victory without loss' and as you watch the film this will become apparent. The story is in depth and you have to watch to follow the plot. The film is lengthy but how else could you fit everything in? It was done superbly and could have been six hours long and i wouldn't have cared. This must be one of the best movies ever made and i am sure many people-would agree."""
The Machinist (2004),"Good Movie - Worth watching - Mr.Bale pulls off an amazing performance - Writing was great - Bale with his weight loss added to the his and the movie's freakishness - glad to see it was not too predictable either - Mr Bale only gets better - I hope he does a lot of parts like this rather than try to get to mainstream - This is one the best movies of the year  no doubt about it - With more people watching and hearing about it - It will live on for quite a while - From the start to the end we are brought into a strange  strange world and what a ride we go on - I want to tell everyone to watch this movie - Enjoy this movie and enjoy Bale's performance - There is also the talented Jennfier Jason Leigh who I can't say anything bad about her - she is amazing in anything she does\tI loved the dark vibe to this film. It felt to me like a modern  expanded 'Twilight Zone' episode and also had touches of Hitchcock to it. What made me feel this at first was the great film score and then as I watched further it become more apparent to me. I am a huge fan of the Rod Serling's 'Twilight Zone' series and this really had that feeling to it.I would have to say that I have seen films similar in plot before...a man who may or may not be imagining people or things around him. I thought to myself while watching  these people better be real...otherwise I've seen this way too many times.But I think Christian Bale is a great actor and I really enjoyed his character here. Everything in his physical presence showed he really went the distance for this role and his acting was top notch. The cinematography was wonderful also  and I suppose that goes back to the Twilight Zone-ish qualities that I love. Definitely worth seeing.\tFrom the camera angles and cinematography to the Bernard Hermann inspired score  this is clearly an ode to Hitchcock  and a damn good one at that. Christian Bale plays a lonely factory worker whose life is slowly unraveling due to lack of sleep. In his disoriented state of half waking/half sleep  nightmarish paranoia and a creepy mystery lead our protagonist careening down a highway to damnation...or perhaps salvation.There's lots of clever little nods to things both literary and Hollywood. Shades of \Memento \"" \""Fight Club \"" and David Lynch abound  but what helps this film rise above a simple amalgamation of previous efforts in the genre is the go-for-broke performance from Bale. He literally made himself look like a Holocaust victim for the sake of the art. \""If you were any thinner you wouldn't exist \"" people keep telling him. Physically  emotionally  and mentally  a man riddled by guilt has never before been more blazingly presented on screen.\t\""The Machinist\"" is one of those rare films for rare people -- the kind of people that like a little punishment with their crime.This film is not for the casual viewer or the merely bored. It's rife with literary allusion -- from Doestevsky's \""The Idiot\"" to cinema's \""Memento \"" it's a ripe  ripe film ... if you like allusion  literary contemplation and a little bit of cliffhanger.If you just like to be entertained on your off days  it might still be a ripe film  all right ... in that it will stink to you if your attention span is too short to hang on until the explanation at the end.I am surprised that David Lynch did not make this well-done  twisted  sometimes confusing film.\t** SPOILER HINTS AT PLOT PATTERN ** With films like fight club setting the bar for this type of plot twist thriller  I don't think this film reached it. I'm an enormous Bale fan and a major fan of this sort of film  that shows feasible paths for normal people to become the most unrecognisable shadow of themselves. Throughout the movie  there is an obvious and pending plot twist as you watch reznik rip himself apart but the director made us wait too long. The plot twist is powerful but not worth the preceeding period of boredom  since its quite obvious what is and is not real  watching the scenes that reznik completely imagines becomes tedious. It's definitely worth a watch for fans of Bale and the genre. The plot twist is enlightening and agreeable but its the sort of movie you'll want to take a break in the middle of.\tThis movie was interesting. Firstly for 20 minutes it is hard to even watch Christian Bale without feeling ill. Losing 28 kilos must have seemed like a good idea at the time  but surely one visit to the mirror and the man realised he was in trouble. After getting over that sick feeling your watching someone about to die  I really started to evaluate the movie. It seemed very arty  with an almost blue tinge to it. It reminded me of Fight Club  Memento and Requiem for a dream at times. There was a melancholy underneath everything that Christian Bale did. I sat mesmerised by the movie  but in the back of my mind I kept thinking sure it's a beautiful movie to watch  and sure Bale is brilliant as always  but is it really a special movie. I was unsure for most of the last half hour  until the end came  and then I'd known I had just seen a very special movie. It was unoriginal in an original way  and I'm so glad I saw it.\tThe Machinist fist gained popularity from the record setting weight loss that lead actor Christian Bale under went to film this movie. Bale looks like a talking zombie and because of that it gives his performance a more twisted edge. In this twisted story Trevor Reznik is a machinist whose physical appearance and attitude begin to concern his co-workers. When a mysterious southern man begins to appear everywhere in Trevor's life it sets off a chain of events that causes him to question his sanity.Bale transforms himself into Trevor so brilliantly that you forget it's him just playing a role. Jennifer Jason Leigh helps the story along as a prostitute named Stevie and is a good equal to Bale's intense presence on screen.\tMy friend rented this movie the other night and I had no expectations about it what so ever. Eventually I found myself nailed in front of the TV. Couldn't even take the usual cigarette break  I just had to watch this one from start to end without any kind of interruption  that's how intensive I think it was. The casting is carefully chosen  with Christian Bale as a guy who really looks like a relic from the concentration camps of World war II Germany. I'm not usually a sensitive person about ugly and disgusting things but Bale's appearance really made me feel sick from the starting minutes of the flick. This guy really knows how to sacrifice his body for artistic reasons. The visual settings are pretty dark and hopeless and the misery of Mr. Reznik can be sensed with a good mixture of devoted acting  matching soundtrack and good camera work. Also I liked the film noir-type elements in the story. What more could go wrong in a life of an individual? This is a f****d up movie  I recommend you watch it in one piece to maintain the rare intensity.\tThis review contains information that may be deemed a spoiler by some people. Basically  I tell you what horrible plot device I'm happy they didn't use. Overall I thought the movie was really good. The Machinist kept me wanting to know what happened next  up to the end. The end which wasn't entirely terrible kinda reminds me of a \""Kill Bill Vol.2\"" ending. At the end of \""Kill Bill Vol 2\"" I expected an awesome fight scene but on first viewing was disappointed with the way Tarantino handled it. Subsequent viewings have made me appreciate the way Tarantino threw a sucker punch in there that you wouldn't expect. In \""The Machinist\"" the build-up is so twisted that you expect the ending to be something you couldn't possibly have imagined. {b}I{/b} wanted the ending to be so far out there that it would freak me out like the rest of the movie did. (*possible spoiler*) All signs pointed to Trevor and Ivan being one and the same but thankfully  that wasn't the case. It was was an all right \""Aha!\"" in \""Fight Club\"" but if they had done it here it would've almost ruined the movie because of the sheer cheesiness of it. (*/end spoiler*) I think upon a second watching I might like the ending more and knowing the end will change the color of the movie for me. Events that seemed sinister during the first viewing will take on a lighter tone. As for the how the movie was shot  it's really good. The coloration they use gives a lot of the movie an almost black and white look which is effective in creating a sense of foreboding. The way the dark halls were shot reminded me of what a dark hall was like as a child. The movie is able to convey a sense of dread through the use of a muted color palette. I'm definitely going to recommend this movie to people and I'll watch it again just so I can have foresight this time. It'll be almost like watching \""Identity\"" for the second time.\tIn the middle of the mass of blockbusters  dumbed down horror movies and samey Indie dramas; it's nice to see that some filmmakers still feel the need to push the bar and deliver something different. The Machinist is a deeply dark and disturbing movie that sees Christian Bale as a worker in an industrial factory. If he were any skinnier  he wouldn't exist and he hasn't slept in a year; but still he manages to carry on his mundane existence. Things aren't quite rosy in his life either; strange things are happening to him without explanation and it isn't long before our protagonist doubts his own sanity. Christian Bale lost an amazing 63 pounds for this movie  and while it might have been a struggle for the actor; it certainly wasn't in vain! Bale's stick-like  ill appearance adds immensely to the film and if director Brad Anderson hadn't got himself such a dedicated performer in Christian Bale  The Machinist wouldn't have been half the film it is. Bale has impressed on numerous occasions  and it's about time he got praise he deserves.Christian Bale's main co-star is most definitely the atmosphere. Brad Anderson is keen to get down and dirty with this movie  and he's given it a truly downbeat  gritty style. This is absolutely great to look at  especially for fans of macabre movies. The claustrophobic camera angles add to this atmosphere and help to enforce the idea that the machinist is living in his own surreal environment. The plot works more from a premise than an actual story; but this is good as it allows the director to put the focus of the story squarely on the protagonist  and his decent into insanity provides an ample base for an intriguing movie. The Machinist is a very encouraging film  as it shows that there is still room for dark  macabre films in modern cinema. Brad Anderson's earlier feature 'Session 9' shows that the man has a real flair for atmosphere  and it will be interesting to see how his remake of George Romero's less than brilliant 'The Crazies' turns out. On the whole  this film is excellent. The atmosphere is beautifully done  the acting is superb and the film manages to keep your interest throughout. What more could you ask for?\tJust finished watching the machinist  and I must say that this was one of the better movies I have seen for a while. Dark and brooding  and nice use of suspense played out thru the movie  some nice little gotcha's thru out the plot. It kept me engaged for the entire film  and guessing all the way to the end. I am glad that the gore factor was kept down to a minimum  as when it was used  it certainly heightened the viewing experience. Bale is superb and I feel that its a pity that he does not get the credit that he deserves  both his physical transformation for this  and his acting was some of the best I have seen for a while. I am glad that as an actor he takes varied roles  American Psyco and Batman begins are great movies.\tNot your average thriller or psycho-drama  this film is unbelievably good - and as freaky as they come. It's intense  totally gripping and scary. My stomach was in knots the whole way through  but at the same time I kept sighing and shaking my head in awe of the film's subtle wit and tenderness. I was as scared as I've ever been watching a film and then  the next minute  I was weeping like a baby. A truly deep and powerful  lovely movie. Imaginative and amazing. Really brilliant. I'd go so far as to say it should be required viewing for anyone studying film or screen writing. And I now realize Christian Bale  one of the finest actors going  is also one of the most underrated.\tObviously Christian Bale is absolutely one of the only Artists with conviction left in this Hollywood full of egotistical pretty boys(with the exception of a few awesome actors and actresses). This performance will probably go down as one of his best. I definitely have even more respect for him after seeing this movie.Now  with that said  id like to just comment on the movie. the story is a very cool  very sleek version of memento meets fight club. its still original enough to definitely hold its own  but i think the end of the movie completely falls apart. the movie moves at a good pace and allows you to really get into reznik's life. But at the 1 hr 15 min mark  it all seems to just rush to the end. throughout the movie you are trying to figure out whats going on and who exactly everyone really is. This is futile though  because there really aren't any clues thrown out that anyone could possibly pick up on that lead you anywhere near what the truth is. In the last 15 minutes of the movie  everything just gets explained (with the exception of why the hell Ivan has toes on his hands or who he is for that matter) and its all wrapped up and presented like a gift to you  eerily like a Stephen King novel. this is an extreme disappointment as all the theories you develop throughout the movie become null and void.The movie has an extremely awesome look and feel and i think the crew did an absolutely awesome job of bringing you into this very eccentric world of sleep deprivation. all in all id say the movie is worth seeing  if not just for seeing these actors and actresses acting their hearts out for a relatively independent film.\tEven though \""The Sixth Sense\"" came first  raked in more dough  and established that GOTCHA! third act twist that re-defined everything that had gone on before  \""Fight Club\"" took a route that was more psychological (and satirical) and less gimmicky and ultimately suffered at the box office for being too damn subversive and challenging for audiences expecting a bare-knuckles movie about  y'know  guys beating each other up. In that film  we follow an insomniac narrator who takes charge of his nihilistic life with the aid of anti-corporate crusader Tyler Durden  who winds up being nothing more than a figment of the narrator's imagination. It's a testament to the cleverness and believability of this twist that it has been mined pretty successfully in subsequent films like \""Session 9 \"" \""Secret Window \"" \""High Tension \"" and now \""The Machinist \"" a film as frightening as it is compelling  with an uncanny psychological depth and a keen eye for detail.Like the aforementioned films  \""The Machinist\"" is quite disorienting upon first glance--its ending requires the viewer to all but re-start the movie to find out what it all means. Patience is essential to get into the rhythm of the film  which is deliberately paced and builds gradually to its turns  both expected and unexpected. If you expect a movie to lay down all the facts  explain every detail  and come to a tidy conclusion  you might want to bypass \""The Machinist.\"" Directed by Brad Anderson (who helmed the brilliant \""Session 9\"") from a script by Scott Kosar (the same man who graced us with the loathsome \""Texas Chainsaw Massacre\"" remake)  \""The Machinist\"" is the tale of Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale)  an industrial worker harboring immense feelings of guilt for unknown reasons--he hasn't slept in a year as a result  and has starved himself down to a dangerously low weight (though the image of an emaciated Bale is not the film's most harrowing aspect); his bosses and coworkers are uneasy around him  and one day he causes a gruesome accident while distracted by the mysterious Ivan (a brilliantly cast John Sharian)  a fellow worker who might not even exist. Anchored to reality by a sympathetic hooker (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and an airport waitress (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon)  Trevor is plagued by cryptic messages on post-it notes that somehow wind up in his apartment  the most grim being a 6-letter hangman with two letters already filled in.In the paranoid stew brought about by his guilt  Trevor's perception becomes that of a mad conspiracy theorist who believes the ultimate plot is against himself...and who is to say it isn't? There is a brilliant sequence within the bowels of a carnival ride  where every image--from a corpse with its guts splattered to the silhouetted customers inside a brothel--triggers a twinge of panic in Trevor that makes us wonder how much of this is an actual ride  and how much is imagined (or amplified) by his guilt-riddled conscience. The ultimate beauty of \""The Machinist\"" is that it endures past its revelation because the world we have just watch unfold  with characters we THOUGHT we knew  turns out to be the product of a sleep-deprived (and  at a whole year  certifiably insane) mind; at the same time  this also reflects the kind of person Trevor Reznik aspired to be in the wake of the crime he perpetrated. The film's title and the oppressive  grease-stained factory environment lends it to a moody metaphor: was Reznik really a machinist  or was the scenario a representation of his swaying conscience  as gears turn clockwise and counterclockwise inside metal boxes as machines are turned on or off and are at times unstoppable for discernible reason  thus causing unforeseen tragedy? In addition to its loftier ambitions  \""The Machinist\"" is calmly effortless in showing how clever it is without being showy--which is why the film warrants multiple viewings. The amount of foreshadowing and character flip-flops and real-life incidents transposed into Reznik's remorseful fantasy world is done with an incredible amount of care. Seemingly trivial details  like a fishing rod on a closet shelf; a close-up of a sticker; the image of bumper cars in the foreground while Trevor talks to the waitress' son  all have a soul-shattering impact that is impossible to uncover upon a single viewing. Like the bastard child of \""Spider\"" and \""Fight Club \"" \""The Machinist\"" is a persistent challenge  an ultimately bleak glimpse into the life of a man whose mind has been hollowed by guilt even more so than his body.\tRight upfront  let me tell you that I didn't enjoy watching this movie one bit. That said  I have to be fair and admit that this movie perhaps could find its audience. It's suspenseful enough to keep you wishing to get to the end and find out what's going on. The cinematography is extremely expressive correctly conveying the movie message. Christian Bale is truly unbelievable in what he has done for this role. (By the way  the way he looks in the movie is NOT for the weak-hearted.) The dialogue is pretty decent  and the characters have been well developed. Overall  the movie is definitely unique. But a word of advice to anyone looking for a lighter fare: this movie is not for you. If you don't feel disturbed  you will be by the end.\tChristain Bale (American Psycho and more recently Batman Begins) stars as Trevor  a factory worker who  for reasons unknown to even himself  has been unable to sleep for over a year  but as the film builds to it's revelatory climax  the reason's for his insomnia start to become clearer.The Machinist has hint's of Jacobs Ladder  Memento  Dark City and The Sixth Sense  and like those movies  this too is a superb piece of film-making with a shattering denouement.Bales performance is method acting to it's extreme  he lost an incredible 65lbs to achieve the skeletal frame of Trevor Teznik  and his tortured performance must be commended.There are clues to Trevors past but you will have to pay close attention  and like The Sixth Sense this is one film you will want to re-watch in a 'new light'\tThis is a very good thriller that deserves a watch  It's best that you know as little about it as possible  so I won't give any spoilers.Christain Bale is superb in this  his physical state is remarkable  especially when you consider he had to put all the weight straight back on and get into shape for Batman Begins. It doesn't overshadow his acting though and I'm surprised that he never got a look in during the awards season. After all Oscar loves a gimmick.The cinematography is very nice and dark and the plot keeps you guessing  allowing you to figure it out rather than being flung around and confused. Director Brad Anderson deserves credit for not trying too hard to impress and surprise  he plays it out to a natural conclusion that brings everything together.Give it a try if you're looking for a dark thriller that makes you think.\twas permanently put to rest by Christian Bales as \""The Machinist\"". This incredible evocation by Bales  including the astounding level of commitment and effort put into this role renders insufficient the standard Hollywood superlatives. I've seen  more serendipitously than by choice  all Bale's other works. This film and his work in it are in a different galaxy. Not a film for everyone; extremely intense and dark. But very brilliant and Bales delivers one of the best performances i have ever seen in 40 years or more as an avid movie fan. Set design  make-up  supporting work all compliment a compelling vision of inner conflict in search of resolution. It's wonderfully directed and a very creative work on its own  but with Bale's performance this is a must-see for all serious film lovers.\tChristian Bale is one of the best actors. It surprises me how underrated he was until this year considering his performance in a numerous number of terrific flicks (Amer. Psycho  Equilibrium etc). This year  due to both Machinist and the new Batman movie  things are at last looking better! This movie is not an easy one. It is disturbing and confusing many times but follows a logical and unexpected plot. It basically tells a story of how bad conscience and loneliness may affect a human mind. A psychological thriller at its best! The performance of Mr Bale is top-notch as always.Score: 9 of 10.\tOverall I liked this movie. It reminded me a lot of Hitchcock  darker aspects having nothing to do with supernatural but the inner-workings of a person. In fact  that can be so much scarier. The Machinist is a bit darker and more violent that Hitch  but the elements of man vs himself (without that realization) is certainly there.The movie is about Trevor. He's a guy who works with heavy machinery  sleeps with a call girl  and seems to really like sticky notes and bleach. Overall leading a simple life. However  it's obvious that this guy had some serious issues. For one  he has a body that concentration camp inmates could envy  people keep telling him  \""If you were any thinner you wouldn't exist.\"" I'd have to agree with those people  as I found one of the most disturbing aspects of the film to be Christian bale's emaciated body. Then there's also the fact that he admits to not having slept for the last year  although he consistently complains of being tired. Why? Well  that what the film is about. What is the cause of his insomnia?"""
The Notebook (2004),"WOW! i cried and cried and cried! it was so freaking good! and when they had sex! WOW! i wanted my boyfriend so freaking bad!!!!!!!!!! o my gosh!!!! SO GOOD! A INFITY STARS! My favorite parts are when they Kissed and kissed and kissed and kissed and u should get the point! IT Wasn't OVer and IT STIll Isn't OVER! one of the best lines in that movie OK maybe the best or ITs not about keeping your promises.. ITs about following your heart! or! (hehe) If your a bird I'm a Bird OK its my favorite movie period its a total MUST SEE!! So if ya haven't seen it get in the car rite now and go by it and don't forget tissue! you will cry it is expected\tAll I could think of during this movie was how I \skipped\"" on my one true love. I married because everyone thought I should do the right thing. Now my true love lives in another state and I'm living with a man that I'm comfortable with. I like him enough but I wish I'd gone for that one true love like Allie did.Watch the whole film start to finish. You will be hooked. Allie will capture your heart and Noah is a godsend. I've never seen a man want a woman that much ever  and yet be willing to let her go for real love.This movie is made for all the true romantics that love to cry! It will call you back again and again.\tI saw this movie 4 times at the theater and bought it as soon as it came out. It was THE most awesome movie I have ever seen in my life. Very romantic and the plot and setting were beautiful. The actors and actresses were great and well chosen for their parts. Oh yes  I read some of the comments about the birds at the end  when Noan and Allie \""passed on\""  please read the sequel to the movie  \""The Wedding\"". It is a must read  I hope they will make a movie out of it  and will use the same cast. (Would ruin it otherwise) That would be a Godsend. It is so heartwarming from the beginning of \""The Notebook\""  to the end of \""The Wedding\"". This story enlightens a persons inner soul. Should have won all the awards that year. I have the movie and both of the books. Nicholas Sparks is a great writer  I will have all of his books in my collection  no doubt.\tAfter being told time and time again by my female friends to \""watch The Notebook  you'll cry soooo much!\"" I finally did it  alone  in the privacy of my own home  so that if it was too terrible I could deny ever having seen it later.It was almost exactly what I expected it to be. Boy from lower class meets girl from upper class  separated by parents  reunited by chance years later  girl has to decide between the man she loved at 17 and her fianc\u00e9e  who represents the world she \""belongs\"" in. Sound familiar? It should  it's a plot that's been worn thin through overuse  and a charming performance by Rachel McAdams is not enough to give it new life. Nicholas Sparks  known mostly for for his even greater offender on the sentimental scene  A Walk to Remember  seems more interested in constructing a tale that entertains due to its predictability and tried-and-true appeal  not its originality or the freshness of dialogue  setting  or character. Despite showing a few impressive chops  Ryan Gosling fails to break out of the stock underdog role  and achieves his distinctive moments only during the moments where he's pitted against McAdams in their frequent fights  not during the love scenes themselves.The real charm of this movie  for me  was the structure that the story is set against. An old man reads the story of the two young lovers to an old woman suffering for the last stages of Alzheimer's  a routine that we are given to understand happens every day. This elderly act of love is a thousand times sweeter and more convincing than any part of the story he retells--though Sparks can't resist tossing in further cheap sentiment by constant references to an expected \""miracle\"" that will cure his companion's disease.Technically  the movie is impressive. The sets and directing are generally above par  but cannot save the movie from being a typical chick-flick tear jerker. It has redeeming qualities  certainly  but after watching it I felt the hype it's received as \""a perfect and enduring love story\"" was not fully deserved. In a few years  it will still have its fans  but it will be regaled to two copies in Blockbuster's that get rented perhaps once a month  replaced by similar movies that are again declared \""beautiful and heartwarming\"". The acclaim it's earned popularly is  in my opinion  only earned because the lovers of this film loved the story before they even entered the theatre  and were thrilled to get exactly what they expected.\tI know i'm only 14 nearly 15 but this movie is one of the best movies i have ever seen!! I cried sooo much! it really makes you feel like your apart of the movie and you feel the emotions the people are actually going through....its a moving story and it makes me want to wait as long as it takes to find the right guy for me  he has to be fun  romantic  and love me for who I am and be respectful of me!I think that if you haven't seen this movie you should run to your nearest video store or any video store in fact  and grab this movie  it is an all time classic film  really gets you thinking about where your relationship is going....and also it makes us ladies realise that its sad that there ain't many guys out there in the world anymore that can treat a lady like Noah the guy in the film treated the one he loved sooo much  he was a real gentleman! I wish I could have a guy like the one in that movie! well its a real classic and I LOVED IT!! :]\tThis movie was beyond beautiful. The entire plot was just magical  sweet  and tender. I own the movie and it has become one of my favorite films. I enjoy the great love the characters have for each other. I work in a nursing home  so seeing that kind of affection from old school folks really does exist. It's warm to see that kind of love outlast some of the turmoil and cruelty life throws your way. It's so hurtful to watch the person you love and adore not remember you little by little. They forget the life you've shared. Alternately  Allie's depression and turmoil that she's forgetting the one thing that's been a constant in her life. The older characters played their parts to a T. You sensed the deep love and loyalty he had to his wife's well-being.Ryan and Rachel were adorable together. I can't imagine anyone else in their parts  but I'm sure it could be doable with other actors. These two just had great chemistry like a real relationship. When I say that  I mean  you could see yourself in a relationship like their's. It reminded me a lot of my own relationship with a significant other. Two people come into each other's lives and profoundly affect the other so that nothing can really break that bond. Not years of separation or misunderstanding. That love really does exist  and this movie visualized it for us.I liked the singularity of Noah's character. He has one parent  one best friend  and one girlfriend. His world is very closed  and Ryan hit upon that well. As Allie  Rachel played her as a likable young girl. Not some spoiled rich chick with no understanding of life. Rachel understood Allie's confusion to play by the rules  but it was different in that she truly loved him. It wasn't some arbitrary set-up by elitist parents. Lon was very deserving of her love. James Marsden has really grown as an actor as well by being in this movie. I look forward to greater things (no more \""Disturbing Behavior\"" films please :D). Beautiful cinematography. Beautiful acting. Beautiful music. It was a love story that was on par with \""Love Story\"" and other greats. Truly recommend.\tI love this movie because Rachel Mcadams is the best actress ever! and her and Noah on the notebook have the best love story it is so sweet and i just love the movie i watch it like 2 times a day or more its not because i have nothing to do its just that i have to stay with my little sister and i can't do anything so i watch the notebook I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! well i love Rachel make some more movies with Rachel in them OK please she is so cool i love her!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so just make more and more and more movies with her i will be watching every single one of those movies they will be great if she is in them well just keep on doing what your doing i'll talk to ya'll later bye\tI really enjoyed the Notebook. It was a tearjerker but I watch it every time I catch it on cable. I love Nicholas Sparks' stories. I hope they make more of his books into movies. I also loved A Walk To Remember. The Notebook makes me cry every time I watch it but I can't help but watch it whenever I can. I love Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams both separately and as an on-screen couple. The movie was very well done. I thought Joan Allen played the snobbish mother to perfection. I like the way Ryan Gosling's character was in contrast to Rachel's character. I love the fact that even though they argued all the time they loved each other unconditionally. I especially like the fact that he never left her side even through her illness. Nobody tells a story like Nicholas Sparks and I hope he keeps writing. I want to see more from Ryan Gosling  he is soooooo SEXY!!! I liked him in Remember the Titans also. He looks especially good with the facial hair. Everyone out there should check out The Notebook if you have the opportunity. Go out and buy the DVD right away.\tthis movie was the most amazing romantic film...i enjoyed every moment..Ryan Gosling and Rachel Mcadams gave 5 star performances..hopefully in the future sparks might fly between these cute Canadian actors.This move brought tears to all who watched it.This caring and devoted film was the best romantic film of the year.Through the tears and the laughter every1 knows that by far this movie is a ten for 2 unknown actors.for those who haven't seen this movie its a definite must see! So if you haven't seen the notebook u will regret it!THE NOTEBOOK WAS SO AWESOME!So go out nd get it! YOU WILL LOVE IT!THIS MOVIE IS A MUST SEE FOR ALL THE LADIES OUT THERE WHO LOVE A ROMANTIC MOVIE!\tThis film opens with  possibly  one of the most beautiful sequences that I have EVER seen on film. During the opening credits the rower on the lake in the twilight to the fantastic piano main title by Aaron Zigman while the camera slowly pans in on Gena Rowlands  standing in a window of a mansion watching the birds approach  brings tears to my eyes.Unfortunately  in my opinion  the \""young\"" leads come across as being rather bland and uninteresting whereas Rowlands and Garner as the mature couple are magnificent and more than make up for any weak moments. Joan Allen in a co-starring role as Allie's mother is great as well  especially as she \""becomes human\"" and reveals a deep secret about her own youth towards the end of the movie.Well worth watching for the beautiful story line and the fantastic performances of Rowlands  always a treat  and Garner. Do not forget to have a large box of Kleenex nearby !\tWhen The Notebook first came out in theatres  I thought to myself \""great another mushy-gushy film.\"" But when my friend and I decided to see a movie  there was little selection. So after complaining a lot  I caved in and went and saw the movie. As the previews came on  I kept thinking that I should run out of the theatre. When the movie was over I couldn't believe how extraordinary and moving the performance was. As the summer neared to an end  my friends and I all got together for our usual back to school meeting just to make sure we didn't buy the same clothes. During our usual meeting  6 out of my 7 friends had seen it and absolutely loved it(the other one had been at camp so she didn't have a chance to see any movies.)We all decided to go see it again and came out of the theatre crying even though we had all seen it before. After that movie came out  I cant imagine a movie even being as close to perfect as this one was.\tThis has by far been my favorite movie of the year. I absolutely loved every second of it. It was very believable. It was also very dreamlike. Boy meets girl. Boy loves girl. Girl resists boy. Boy and girl fall in love. Girls parents tear them apart. I knew from the beginning that the old people were Noah and Allie and that Allie picked Noah. I really didn't like Lon  or the actor who played him (whose name I cannot remember.) I think he did a poor job. Rachel McAdams was brilliant in this movie. Absolutely breathtaking. I also found myself loving Noahs character dearly. Ryan Gosling made you believe that he really was that wonderful perfect guy. I found my heart leaping at the loving sweet things he said. A+!\tThis movie absolutely steals my heart and just makes me break down in tears every time I watch it. It's such a beautiful story and  although seemingly tragic  the ending just puts the biggest smile on your face.I could find no weaknesses in acting or cinematography and the setting was absolutely perfect. My only issue with this movie is James Garner and Gena Rowlands look nothing like Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. Other than that it is probably my favourite movie to date.I can't help but feel refreshed in a world of cold when I watch this heart-warming movie.Absolute 10/10\tI absolutely adore this film! I mean how can you not love it...I always thought that Titanic would always be my favourite romantic movie but then then this came along out of the blue and changed everything! The characters are down to earth  the setting is realistic and the actual romance is believable! Its these things that make it feel personal and real. The actors and actresses aren't glamorised or airbrushed and the actual acting is brilliant because the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams is so amazing. I personally think that they are in a different league and will hopefully be noticed in the future because they are brilliant.\tin life  i know a similar story  which tells an old man  reading diaries to his sick wife in bed... that diary book  recorded all their life in the past half decade time. they met they married they experienced a lot in that past half decade years... through many big events  social and private.. but when the time comes  she lost her memory  while he still remembers every detail.. those details  could be common for those of their age  can also be unusual extraordinary for those of our age... but for the old man and his wife.. they are the gold age which belongs only to them...this movie The Notebook  reminds me in every scene  of the story in my real life.. it just so resemble the real story.... so i would also dream  that one day  i can write a movie  write out about the true story..some movies  do not lay its events on real history background. but i would still believe  those can really make people moved  is those which based on real history period  with real human characters presented.. well  also need good acting of these remarkable actor and actress  which always amazing me a lot. The Notebook  is just such a good movie.\tMy sister rented the notebook yesterday and I thought it would be rubbish because she normally rents rubbish films. But I decided I would watch it anyway.It starts off with an old man coming to read a story to an old lay in a nursing home.The story is a romance about a young boy(Noah) and girl(Ali) having a summer love. Ali's parents are very wealthy and want her to marry a wealthy man. The Ali and her parents have a big argument and the next day Ali has to leave.Noah writes to Ali for a year and ails mother hides her letters. Ali sees Noah in the newspaper and fells that she needs to see him. Even though now that she is engaged to a man called Lon. She see him and they both know that they have to be together. Her mother tells Lon about Noah and he comes to persuade Ali to still marry him.\tRachel McAdams playing the young Allie Hamilton character does an outstanding  passionate performance as a young girl falling in love for Ryan Gosling performing as the young Noah Calhoun gives the right chemistry for the audience for us to share in this experience. Their performances pulls us into their passion  their love.This is balanced out with Gena Rowlands and James Garner playing the roles of the older couple as the older Allie and the Duke later on in years of their relationship. As the story is told about their life  seeing their love for one another develop  seeing their passionate love grow for one another is wonderful to share in this cinematic experience  more than once.Another film comes to mind is \""The Family Man\"" where Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni are great together with their love for each other but in a different context.\ti personally just cant get over how much i love the notebook. it is a heartwarming tale of true love. which i think is hard to come by these days  not that it doesn't exist or that everyone doesn't have an equal chance at true love  just by the fact that i think a lot of people settle. they settle for less than they should. they get pregnant  they don't want to wait  they are over-come with feelings of love and newness that only evaporate after so long if you don't truly love a person. watching this movie  i became so captured up in the love story and what was going to happen with these 3 people (ally  noah and lon). for each character was loving in its own way. its hard to point out the villain in the story  some would say lon b/c everyone is rooting for noah. but lon really cares for ally just as noah does. i found her mom to be the villain by keeping them apart. this movie reminded me of the innocence of first love  which wasn't that long ago  and how things don't always turn out the way you had planned. sometimes its hard to follow your heart but its even harder to go through life thinking of how you could have changed it.\tThere are many features about the Notebook that I liked. For instants the director Nick Cassavetes and actors gave their best towards this movie. Even though there is nothing really special about this film  it touched me: the simplicity and the beautiful way it was filmed..The best part of the film where the performances of the different actors making the film therefor quite believable. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams really succeeded in giving a good-to-watch-performance. The old Noah and Allie (Tim Ivey and Gina Rowlands) had an important role and gave a extremely believable and absolutely brilliant performance.Even though I don't think Rachel McAdams (young Allie) was the right actor for her role  I found her to be quite good and believable. Especially when she was acting a teenage girl. Ryan Gosling I a different matter  I think he was just the right choice for his part. He did really well in acting a teenager and the later a more mature man. Brilliant work from both the actor Ryan Gosling (young Noah) and the director Nick Cassavetes.I personally watch tons of movies and I often like them even though many might say I sucks. I don't actually even like love stories that much  but the Notebook brought to my mouth these words; This movie has been done out of love towards movies. My opinion is still quite simple: It's mostly just a good-old  ordinary love story with a nice touch to it.The film succeeded in being the film that it was suppose to be. Well made and worth a watch at least from DVD  TV or cable..\tThis love story about a couple who meet and reunite after world war 2 is well written  directed and acted. This is one of those \"" chick flicks\""  however its probably the best one I've seen in a while. I enjoyed this film because the story appealed to me  characters were very interesting  script was well written and director kept it interesting  and actors did a good job of playing their roles. I am starting to actually like Gosling after seeing him in United States of Leland and now this. This film was entertaining and a great one for the couples to watch. Rachel McAdams is up and coming and i look forward to her doing good work like this film 9/10"""
The Phantom of the Opera (2004),"I was pleasantly surprised after initially viewing this movie adaptation of the historically renowned theatrical performance. As a trained vocalist  I was not surprised to read several snobbish and boorish reviews concerning the lack of trained vocalists included in the movie. I often wonder if the people paid to review these films actually have any training to accurately comment on such matters while spewing venom from their esteemed perches. Personally  I make a point to see any movie that has been vilified by the pseudo-intellectual vermin. The critics certainly missed the call on this movie.Gerard Butler was outstanding in his rendition of The Phantom. Unfamiliar with his previous acting ability  Butler's strong acting performance encouraged me to further inquire about his training and career.Familiar with many of the previous movie adaptations and the Broadway performance  I always felt that the phantom was a figure whose devotion to Christine and her musical career were misunderstood. This further applies to the fact that The Phantom is a figure who exudes a tremendous amount of sexuality in pursuing Christine. The sexual bond existing between these characters becomes clear when watching the progression of the opening sequences following Christine's magnificent rendition of Think of Me.Christine  torn between her obligation to the Angel of Music (The Phantom) and her childhood sweetheart Raul  remains torn when it concerns the sexual appeal of The Phantom and her present lover. This sexual attraction remains with her despite recognizing the extreme measures that The Phantom is capable of taking in order to assure their future together. In The Phantom's mind  their relationship gradually transcends from tutor-student to a potential love affair. I know this contradicts the ending  but the possibility remains throughout the movie.The most exhilarating moment occurs when The Phantom exits his lair near the end of the movie. I wondered just what happened with respect to Meg (Jennifer Ellison) and a potential relationship with our suffering hero. The fact that she locates his discarded mask  picks it up  and appears to follow after him conjures up the following in my mind: I envision Meg finding The Phantom  becoming his student  and becoming romantically involved with the latter. This would certainly be plausible when at the end of the movie we note the single red rose securing the ring returned by Christine to The Phantom. In this way  I could believe that The Phantom gained some degree of happiness in his life. Regardless  the ending was simply touching and personally moving! I actually hope that Andrew Lloyd Weber considers producing a sequel in order to answer some of the questions that remain once the movie ends. Watch this movie. It allows for conjecture as to what occurred during the period that the Opera House burned and Christine's death.\tI've seen Phantom Several Times on Stage  and this movie doesn't even come close to the stage production at ALL. I was really bored with the Movie not what I expected from Joel Schumacher at all  not that all of his movies are bad  I actually enjoy quite a few of his movies  but in this one The Phantom was played poorly  Christine was played well  plot was nothing like the stage production  some of the musical numbers were rushed I think the thing I enjoyed Most about the Movie was the Music  but that's because I enjoy singing along. More then Likely I won't be adding the DVD to My collection  thought I will be buying the soundtrack. I still think Michael Crawford makes the best Phantom  and Sarah Brightman the best Christine I've ever seen. I was Surprised to see Minnie Driver in this Movie  didn't think she go for a role like that.\tThis movie is just brilliant. I have never seen the stage play or read the books but i have heard of them. But after seeing this great movie i have decided I'm going to read the books as soon as possibleI agreed to see this movie at the cinema with my parents because they wanted to see it so badly. I was completely unprepared when the Phantom overture began and the opera house lights up. I sat there with my mouth open thinking......wow.The music and the songs are brilliant. The acting is beautiful. The scenery and costumes are great. Everything is just fantastic!See this movie. It is thrilling  beautiful and brilliant.\tI love this film. Need I say more. Coming from someone who has never seen the stage production  I loved it. The music  the actors and actresses  the set  the entire film was amazing. Emmy Rossum is one of the greatest young actresses around and she was inspiring and wonderful. She was perfect for the role of Christine and did a phenomenal job. Gerard Butler doesn't seem to get enough credit from most people who have reviewed this film. He was the perfect  ideal Phantom. I see what Andrew Lloyd Webber saw in him and wanted others to see. The Phantom needed to be sexy  yet mysterious and passionate. His voice was soothing and heartfelt. Andrew Lloyd Webber could not have had a better cast. I'm glad he chose actors who weren't that well known because it gives the movie more of a realistic truth. If he had casted well known actors  the film wouldn't have made it seem so real. You have a certain image of what certain characters are like and with these actors  I had that. It was almost like I had invisioned it  only so much better. It exceeded all my greatest expectations and desires. This is one of the most amazing films of all time. Though it didn't receive many awards like it well deserved  it's passion carries on and into the hearts of all of those who are inspired by  \The music of the night.\""\tHaving seen the Movie Version of Cats  West Side Story and countless other Musicals I must say I was not expecting anything overly special when it came to this film  to me most musicals are really rather boring and only enjoyable to watch when nothing else is on.Well This film changes my opinion  all I can say is WOW. The Music Score was excellent  the Acting was brilliant and I was enthralled from start to finish. So much so that I never realised that it went on for as long as it did.The Only Critiques I can come up with are really very minor  and that is the guy who played the Phantom at times did not have a voice that was powerful enough to do justice to the music score  otherwise no complaints.I have to admit that what recommended me to this film was watching a video of the song \""Phantom of the Opera\"" performed by one of my favourite bands Nightwish  the video made the film look good. The thing is the Film is so much better than the Video as to lift the Video up  not the other way around (as is normal).As I rented it  tomorrow (or later today should I say) I am gong to go and buy it. Awesome.\tI've seen the movie and it is a really good movie. It is well written. The actors are really good. Gerard Bulter(The Phantom) really put a lot of feeling in his part by speaking and singing. The part of the movie I liked was \""The Point of No Return\"" Gerard Bulter(The Phantom) and Emmy Rossum(Christine) put a lot of passion and feeling into the song. I really enjoyed the movie  it is seductive and beautiful. The music is really good and well performed. I read the novel by Gaston Leroux and the novel is really good. It is different from the movie  but is well written. Andrew Llyod Webber did a wonderful job of bringing the book on stage and film.\tI was worried I would not like the performance of the character of the Phantom  being portrayed by Gerard Butler. He was magnificent. Incredible actor  great voice  sexier than any man I have ever seen on screen. Made me wish I was 20 years younger  and he was just around the corner. Very believable as the Phantom. 5 star performance. All of the other actors were divine. I came away thinking  I could not wait to buy the DVD. I have purchased 5  for different friends and family. I recently purchased Dear Frankie  and was amazed again at Butler's performance. I cannot wait until his new flick comes out  \""Burns.\"" What a delight to know Gerard Butler will be making more movies that we all can enjoy.\tFor most of us  we have only heard about the Phantom of the Opera  and the image we usually get is a masked man sitting in front of an organ. Imagine my surprise when I saw the movie for the first time. The scenes were beautifully constructed  and there was no doubt it took place in Paris in it's time period. Joel Schumaker and Andrew Lloyd Webber's choice of cast was ideal. Emmy and Patrick already had years of musical experience under their belt  and Gerard had a natural gift (despite being somewhat distracted by his singing lisp)  so the opera style of singing was bearable to the ears and did not threaten to break glass. The storyline flowed nicely  although a question arised often  \""What happened to the Phantom's face to begin with?\"" This was neither explained in the movie nor the book  so it leaves an essence of mystery to the viewers. What makes this even better is that it only differs slightly from the actual stage version of the show. Tweaked lyrics and many more instruments only adds to the effect a movie gives.\tI awaited with extreme impatience for the film release of one of the greatest musicals of recent years.In many respects  the film was superior to the stage production  which I saw in Sydney in the very early 90's - mostly due to the availability of special effects  technology and precise placing of shots  whilst a staging demands a continuous flow from scene to scene.The production  sets and costuming were immaculate  the direction ranged from good to the sublime  and of course the music was glorious  beautifully adapted to the immaturity of the Christine's (Emmy Rossum) voice - Sarah Brightman was an experienced  trained classical singer and it would be unfair to expect the same power and richness to be present in Emmy's voice at just 17 years of age. Raoul (Patrick Wilson) was a glorious surprise - who would have suspected that he would have such a voice. It was so very enjoyable to see his character given greater prominence in the film.The major disappointment  and the only item holding the film back form a 10 out of 10  was the unbelievably poor performance by The Phantom (Gerard Butler). Usually a wonderful actor to watch  in \""The Phantom of the Opera\"" he was wooden and clumsy - when he's supposed to be seducing Christine into his den of musical delights  he seems rather to be dragging a reluctant student to the headmaster. The tortured soul of the genius Phantom is nowhere to be found  rather we see a spoilt little boy having temper-tantrums when he doesn't get the toys he wants.All of which could have been excusable  if his singing wasn't so absolutely appalling. In this day and age where we have the technical brilliance to change a bad voice to a #1 hit  why was so little attention paid to poor Butler. Beside his apparently complete lack of ability to colour his voice with emotions or dynamics (except \""loud\"" or \""soft\"")  there were far too many occasions when his singing was just plainly flat. It was an excruciating pain to anyone who has truly enjoyed the original music and productions. Audrey Hepburn in \""My Fair Lady\"" had her singing dubbed  so (even though this was a very expensive [$95 M] independent production) couldn't the same have been done here? Sorry  Messieurs Schumacher & Lloyd-Webber  but your casting here was a horrible flaw that has dragged down the luster of an otherwise exquisitely beautiful production.\tI love this movie-it is my ultimate favorite  and I love singing along with the soundtrack. Besides being hot  Gerard Butler is an eloquent inspired Phantom paired with fragile  innocent Emmy Rossum as Christine-I love her voice! The thought of watching it is thrilling  and I am glad to own it. Any lover of the original movie  the Broadway musical  or the novel will absolutely love the movie. Every character is refined and wonderful-I love Miranda Richardson  or Mme. Giry.It will be anyone's classic. Eveeryone in it sings beautifully  and I am slightly embarrassed to say that I use it to train my own voice. My friends think I am crazy for loving it so much-at least  the ones that haven't seen the musical masterpiece.\tThe Phantom of the Opera is an old tale written by Gaston Leroux in 1910. Andrew Lloyd Webber made it truly famous with his musical version  and Joel Schumacher has consulted both to bring the musical to the big screen.The story tells of a disfigured child who lives beneath the Paris Opera House and has grown to become an embittered and angry man whose genius lies in music and architecture. He controls the occupants and the owner of the Opera House through a regime of fear  allowing him to collect a tidy wage and have final say over all the shows performed.He sees a young orphaned chorus girl join the troupe and decides to nurture her musical talent from afar. Slowly he falls in love with her and decides to reveal himself to her  yet she is in love with another man and as the love grows so does the Phantoms anger and hatred.The show is a world renowned musical and carries with it a mammoth fan base  so the movie of the musical surely has a lot to live up to. Yet it took a huge hit instantly when Joel Schumacher was confirmed and the general opinion was that the movie was going to be seriously hurt. The casting of Gerard Butler was another huge unknown that took many by surprise  this Scottish actor did not carry such career weight as many expected and with no singing experience behind him there was a lot of concern over the film. However  watching the movie you can't help but be taken in through some of the transition effects between the past and present  the comic moments  some of the excellent actors  and above all the superb performance by Butler.Without a doubt he is the biggest surprise of the movie. His voice can at times sound raw and harsh  yet this adds something real to the character of the Phantom  anger and embitterment seem to creep into his voice at key moments. There's no doubt that Butler has shown the critics that he can make an excellent Phantom  and he is the strongest actor in the movie. Much like the old Hollywood actors  in this film his stage presence is commanding  and his performance utterly believable.Minnie Driver  Miranda Richardson and Simon Callow provide some excellent support  with Driver showing some excellent comic and character acting. Her take on the poor Opera singer Carlotta is wonderful  and provides for many amusing moments.Emmy Rossum as Christine is unfortunately not so good. Her role in the movie is weak and merely entails standing looking confused and dumbfounded for much of the film  miming weakly to her musical numbers. Where Butler provides passion and feeling behind his role  Rossum seems to be humming along. Jennifer Ellison is another weak portrayal  and acts as a conduit for a quick duet early on in the movie and nothing more  it's hard to see why her role was even included.Patrick Wilson as Raoul also provided a very weak performance  totally overshadowed by those around him. He appeared more as a meek teenage Royal rather than a Viscount who could woo such a lady and fight for her honour.Schumacher's treatment was strong  but in places somewhat lacking. During the duet between Christine and Meg for example  both characters were in total darkness at times  and the lighting and camera positioning seemed very wrong. There were also quite a few examples of big scenes with huge sets that just didn't quite come across  the size and grandeur of the set or the moment diminished in some way. This can be seen in the rooftop scene between Raoul and Christine  compared to the similar scene between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge  it falls well short and doesn't carry the same impact.The story is strong though  and provides for a lot of entertainment. The musical numbers are never out of place  apart from the duet  and they build very well to the conclusion of the movie. However there are a couple of points that stick out for me. One is the fact that everyone just stayed at the Opera house and never considered leaving. For some this is very slightly hinted at  as Carlotta is so bad that no one else would employ her  and Madame Giry was brought up there. Yet I never understood why people just left as did the original owner at the start of the tale.The second issue I had with the story is the speed at which events happen. When Christine falls for Raoul  or the Phantom turns on them all  these events are quite big  especially in terms of characters choice  yet they are handled quite flippantly and the characters turn on a coin.There seemed with both points a need for the events to fit the score and the pace of the movie rather than the story being written and then the musical numbers fitted into the story.Still the musical numbers were for the most part good  the story enjoyable and some of the effects  sets and transitions making for a visually engaging movie.\tWe have both seen and liked the 1990's road company stage production in San Francisco (Curran Theater). There were some strange goings-on up there on the stage; I was familiar with the story but had a lot of trouble understanding what was happening. When it was over  I felt confused and the experience was somewhat disappointing. The CD is a nice tutorial although the film (2004) does not follow it closely. The CD is a highlight issue that can prepare one for the stage or the film versions.In the DVD release we find the usual characters and most of the music; but not necessarily in the same order as seen on the stage. We have replaced our entire Home Theater and Stereo Systems during the last two years; thus  our private viewing experience was very satisfying. For us  the film is a smash hit that rounds out our experiences with the Play. Recommended for all viewers.\tJust finished watching the DVD version of the movie. It was absolutely fantastic and I want my own copy to watch again. I was curious to see Patrick Wilson  who played Raoul  as he is the son of one of our local news anchors in Tampa  John Wilson. He was great and really nice to look at. I liked his voice better than the Phantom  played by Gerard Butler  but all 3 leading voices were super. I have heard the music from the stage production over the years  but never seen it on stage. The music was the best element in the film  but artistically and cinematographically great too. It was a feast for the eyes  ears and heart. The soundtrack now rivals \""The Sound of Music\"" for 1st place in my favorites list.\tThis is a wonderful movie that many people can enjoy! The set is gorgeous and the music is absolutely beautiful. It is apparent that Emmy Rossum has spent time in operas herself by the way she portrays Christine Daae  and Minnie Driver is absolutely hilarious as the spoiled leading soprano diva  Carlotta. Gerard Butler (The Phantom) and Patrick Wilson (Raoul) are also very good  both vocally and in acting. The scenes are set beautifully and done so artistically with the music that it makes you feel as though you are sitting right there in the Opera Populaire at the production of \""Il Muto\""! Any aspiring actor looking for Broadway- or any aspiring singer  really- should definitely see this movie. The cast is fantastic  the music is great and of course  the romance is always fun too.\tVisually this film is delicious from the outset  the black and white sequences are reminiscent of the visuals in 'Moulin Rouge'  but the actual actors are quite frankly poor. I am fully aware this is a musical adaptation and some of the moments were truly breathtaking such as the roof scene with the Phantom lurking in the shadows  surrounded by gargoyles  or angels  he makes the similarity in some of the lyrics  but he refers to himself as the \""Angel of the Night\"".There were two clear cut \""toilet breaks\"" in this film  where you could leave the cinema  go to the loo  come back in and the film hadn't moved on. I appreciate the use of tone and melody to put a point across but at the finale when things are rushing and Christine has \""the choice\"" she decides to sing her thoughts in Soprano instead of the realistic split second decision that the Phantom is pressing for.The songs were just stupidly slow moving in parts and Christine looks more like a gormless fool than an enchanting young lady  in parts. The phantom himself almost managed to shape the lyrics into the desired melody but sometimes it felt like they were searching for notes rather than putting things into song because it should be - more of a case of doing it for the sake of it  and the \""Devil Child\"" circus scene is just ridiculous  as if they'd allow for children to be brought up in such a place! I haven't seen the musical and have no desire to.And if the Phantom has lived in the dungeon for so many years - where did he obtain his clothes? How did he learn to speak with such grammatical correctness  where did he learn to write music and what instruments is he using? The whole thing is just absolutely ridiculous - and as for the \""night in shining armour\"" he's more of a wet lettuce than anything to be reckoned with. If the Phantom wasn't just an unfortunate social outcast  then this lad would be cream-crackered! His voice is so monotonous and yawnful that I couldn't help but laugh. It's no wonder Christine is so \""weak willed\"" I would be too just to have a little bit of excitement rather than the \""i want to go wherever you go - that's all i ask\""...that's all you ask?! Right.One good thing about the singing was that all the words (well  more than you normally can hear in a musical) could be heard  well done  but let's face it  the plot isn't exactly hard to follow is it now? Minnie Driver was the only bright spark in this film and even she was remarkably annoying. The two owners of the Theatre were actually superb in their roles  and one particular scene was absolutely perfect (The scene where the Phantom has given them all so many notes  explaining different parts of his plan). Furthermore  what would the Phantom need \u00a320 000 a month for? And  how can he possibly survive down there? We've seen that his saviour wouldn't even dare venture down into the dungeon so I highly doubt she made regular visits to see him.I hate being so pedantic  but the storyline begs these questions  and the storyline isn't good enough to avoid them. It's not so \""magical\"" or \""myserious\"" or \""well shot\"" to rule out these everyday routines! And make of it what you like  but if I've sat through this movie and the first thing I think of is \""how does the phantom survive and his monetary issues\"" then it speaks for itself! It's not all bad. It's averagely good  worth a watch if you've got a couple of hours to waste.\tAfter reading through the commentaries here  I want to see the movie the other writers saw. After I watched Phantom last night  I kept asking \""Where was the passion?\"" Minnie Driver and Miranda Richardson manage to portray some of the passion and emotions their characters experienced  but Emmy Rossum seemed whiny  Patrick Wilson callow and Gerard Butler....well  I have never seen the famous Michael Crawford version  but I have seen other Phantoms (all still unknowns) and all of them assayed the role with more passion and darkness in their pinkies than Butler did with his whole body. Yes  it was pretty to look at (and I will admit that \""Past the Point of No Return\"" was a great sequence) and I give props to the writers for explaining why Carlotta suddenly loses her voice during a performance  but if I never see this again it will be just fine with this Phantom fan.\tThe Phantom of the Opera works  in the movie incarnation anyway  because the Phantom is the soul of unrequited love. Since there are darn few of us on this planet who haven't experienced this  the character is bound to appeal to a whole lotta folks. Butler's earthy rasp is a perfect embodiment of a tortured soul haunting an underground world; an operatic tenor with a finely honed voice would have been completely wrong for the film. The music of the night deserves a powerful voice that strains now and then. Rossum's light soprano has all the fragile-as-glass delicacy that the role of Christine deserves; what an astonishingly fresh performance from this young actress. Patrick Wilson cannot be blamed if the role of Raoul pales in comparison to the Phantom's; it's hard to imagine what character could hold its own against the Angel of Music. He does the best he can: Raoul is no effete and milquetoast aristocrat  but a young buck who drives his horses chariot-style and swings a sword as well as Errol Flynn. And since this is an opera  it really doesn't matter how much of the plot holds together. Opera is all about the music  not the plot  and the lush  romantic music of \""Phantom\"" does exactly what it is supposed to do: tell an emotional story of love  loss  and undying ache. Movies are all about the pictures  and \""Phantom\"" is about as lush a production as anything I've seen on screen since \""Moulin Rouge\"". The art direction manages to convey the frenetic  drunken menage of backstage life without descending into visual chaos. A feast for the eyes from start to finish  a story bound to touch anyone who survived high school crushes  and music that you can't get out of your head--could mortals ask for more? Bravo  bravissimo.\tI remember seeing a preview for this movie a long time ago. It wasn't very long but it looked really cool. I finally got to see the movie  in Jan. 2005  but I didn't realize it was a musical. And I absolutely hated musicals! But as soon as they took the sheet off the chandelier and the Overture started I was hooked.1) Songs POTO has to be Andrew Lloyd Webber at his best. These songs are amazing and will get stuck in your head. The orchestral music is amazing as well as the singing. The lyrics are different from the stage version  but I like these better. There are also 2 new songs written specifically for the movie: Journey to the Cemetery and The Fairground. There is also a swordfight that was not in the play and a new song called Learn to Be Lonely by Minnie Driver at the end of the movie.2) Cast In my opinion  the casting was perfect. Fanatics of the stage-version probably won't agree with me on that  but  oh well. I'm glad that all the actors  except Minnie Driver  did their own singing I'll start with Emmy Rossum as Christine. She has the most amazing voice. I've heard Sarah Brightman sing POTO  and I think that Emmy's voice is much better. She's also perfect  acting wise  for the innocent  naive  and kinda ignorant role of Christine. For most of the movie she has a vacant \""goldfish\"" look on her face that you associate with an innocent  naive  kinda ignorant person.Next  Raoul. I have mixed feelings about Patrick Wilson. He's a great singer and probably the best \""Raoul\"" I've heard. And the first few times I saw the movie I felt bad for him when he was all tied up in the Phantom's lair. Now that I've watched it about 100 times  Raoul just seems funnier and funnier. The girly hair  the funny facial expressions and the whole \""Genius has turned to madness\"" line make me laugh every time I watch the movie.The Phantom- Gerard Butler is my favorite phantom. His voice is perfect for this version of the phantom  who's supposed to be seductive and sexy. The fact that he looks like an Orlando Bloom sundae smothered in Johnny Depp sauce doesn't hurt either. LOL. His performance makes me feel sorry for the phantom (I cried when he broke the mirrors) and it also made facial deformities and sociopathic behavior sexy. lol Carlotta- My favorite character. She's absolutely hilarious. And a bigger diva than J. Lo. Even though she's self-centered and has a horrible voice(which for some reason I'm starting to like)you can't help but like her.\tI've never seen the original plays or read the books  but the movie got me interested. I'm a girl who likes romantic movies. I own at least one movie that has at least one member of the cast in it so most of the actors are familiar to me. Minnie Driver  Miranda Richardson  Emmy Rossum all star in films I own and I've seen Gerard Butler in a movie. The Music- I fairly enjoyed the music. It's probably the one thing that got me attached. I've read that some people thought that Gerard Butler's voice was pretty much  pathetic. However  to me I love it. Emmy's is beautiful. Much more beautiful than my own and my friends think I have a great voice. Patrick  his voice portrays the pretty boy that I've heard from most of my Phantom friends. The Acting- As usual the acting is sublime. That's all I have to say really. Sets  Design  and the what not- The sets are very extravagant  costumes excellent  but to me it's a bit overdone. The plot- It drew me in when I rented the movie on DVD since the movie had not entered theaters around my hometown. So I paid $1 to see this movie and then I bought it with my own money.To the haters  that's your opinion. For me I adore the movie and plan to keep it in my collection for it is an excellent movie that captured me just like Moulin Rouge did when I first saw it. In truth I love the movie more for the costumes and music.\tThe movie is excellent! I had to go to the play every year. Now I'm so hooked that i bring my Mp3 player around listing to the whole soundtrack. I sing it in the car everywhere we go. I have the DVD and i also have a script from the play. i watch the DVD as much as possible.Emmy Rossum was wonderful for the part because i think her beauty was perfect  her voice is like a thousand angels. It's not squeaky and its not low. But Gerard Butler sings a little off key.But when my family went to the play  when the masquerade stairs showed  we were blown away  all the color! I hope this is how the other people feel but my heart is in the phantom of the opera  and i also have a DVD  t-shirt  script  tape  CD and i think we have a poster"""
The Ring Two (2005),"Truly shocking sequel  and not in the way it should be.Naomi Watts is Rachel (Hardly likely to forget that character name in a hurry; doubt I've ever heard any movie character called to by name as many times as is evident in The Ring Two)  mother to Aidan (Though it sounded more like Hayden to me)   that creepy little boy from the first film which ended with him watching *that* video  if I recall accurately.Well the two of them have moved home and Rachel's landed an easy job with a local newspaper as opposed to the big heavy city rag she was formerly with. They have abandoned their old lives as a result of the evil Samara and hope they have escaped her and can move on. However  when a local homicide particularly reports of a kid who died with some kind of 'face'  Rachel gets on the scene to find that it seems Samara's back and up to her old tricks again.The rest of the movie sees all 3 of them in a kind of head to head with Samara possessing Aidan and threatening to stay around for good.OK  that would be a fair synopsis. Now for the the review: .....*drumroll*.....This is bad. Really  really  really bad.Now I'll tell you why.What \The Ring\"" got right was that it was pretty faithful to the original Japanese movie which was such a smash hit in the first place. By not messing too much with the previous formula and avoiding 'Hollywoodising' the story to the usual popcorn extent  the remake was reasonably effective as a psychological chiller.The problem with the sequel is it has *nothing* to do with the original Japanese franchise; it's an all new side-branch story. While in itself there's nothing wrong with this as it stands  it becomes an issue when Hollywood overblows it with  for example  ridiculously overplayed background music  and comedic interludes  some intentional  some not so.The Ring Two has taken a great premise and turned it into an average Yank horror. There's nothing new here  apart from one singularly smart scene which works well (And it's not scary  merely impressive)  and the great strength of the whole Ring 'empire' is the sheer originality of it. Ring was simply stunningly seminal horror  Ring 2 recaptured a lot of the original magic with some shiny technophobery  Ring 0 was a great tale  and the remake managed to translate a lot of the aspects from all 3 into a pretty decent and workable film for the western market.This crude effort lacks any of the punch of *any* of the other 4. There are no good scares  boringly slow direction  overly dark cinematography  and pointless cameos from Sissy Spacek  Gary Cole and Elizabeth Perkins.The Ring Two was a real disappointment  albeit a predictable one. Uninspired from the off  it didn't even look like the actors could be bothered with it  lamely delivering their lines like they were on half pay that day.Avoid.\tWatched it last night. As sequels go I've seen much much worse. The plot was thin in parts and some of it didn't make a whole lot of sense particularly the deer scene. I suspect 98% of the movie audience including the writer and myself had no idea where that came from or where it was going. The boy toy in this film had one purpose and one purpose alone. To die. That's it. Nothing more. I guess somebody had to or it wouldn't have gotten that coveted PG-13 rating. And it wasn't very scary either. The first Ring was indeed more frightening. I don't think I was truly afraid or startled once. I felt compelled to watch this as I did like the original but that's no excuse. The ending was fine with me at least that did make sense to me. Showed me a little style not the typical just shoot the bad guy and he'll go away Hollywood ending. Watts is lovely that's a plus too but she doesn't do a heck of a lot either acting wise. Final Analysis: barely decent but could have been witty and clever.\tThis was a very good movie in my opinion. I think that the acting was great and directing was really great but the story was not expected. It was a little bit of a disappointment because it didn't make enough sense. It pulled through at the ending but a few questions were unanswered. It did have many scares but thats another problem. It didn't make you really think during the movie. some things were out there too much and they tried to make it look like it was hard to understand but through a lot of the movie it wasn't. I think the images were an A+! They were terrific! I suggest you watch this movie with lowered expectations but at the same time just be willing to enjoy the movie. I liked it and say that you should watch it if you've watched the first one and are in for a scare and a surprise. It is sometimes changing and the story makes sense sometimes but sometimes itr doesn't. Rent it first  if you like it  buy it.\tI give it a 6 because that's only what the movie deserves. For me  it's near an 8 or a 9.The beauty of The Ring Two is that having been a fan of the Japanese franchise  and learning this would be a completely new film  I had no idea where they were going to take it. The trailers were very interesting but again  offered no clues as to where the film was going.There's a reason for that.You see  the filmmakers and I had something in common. I had no idea where they were going to go with this film  and neither did they. The film is a confused mess with barely a plot thread stringing it together  certainly a hallmark low for hack writer Ehren Kruger.But that's the charm of it  I guess. It's so confused  and wants to show you all kinds of cool stuff  that the movie itself has been lost. It's no more a clone of the original film than of any of the other films in the Ring canon.But it IS entertaining  and charmingly bereft of a real plot. On the one hand  it's disappointing - the concept of the original is rife with possibilities for a sequel - but on the other  it's sort of grand in its utter inability to capitalize on anything.It's a curiosity of a film that should be seen  if anything  for its utter confusion.I loved it.\tWhen I loaded the IMDb page for The Ring Two  the headlining comment at the time stated that it lacks everything that made the first American adaptation good. I agree with this sentiment. What makes it ironic is that Hideo Nakata  the esteemed director of Ringu  was brought in to direct this mess. The presence of one name in the credits  however  brings me to believe that the overall mess has to do with the screenplay. You guessed it  Ehren Kruger  the man who first came into prominence with Scream 3  wrote The Ring Two. Granted  he also wrote the first American adaptation of the Japanese Ringu films  but director Gore Verbinski was able to wrestle a decent final product out of his raw material. It appears that Hideo Nakata thought he was up to the task of wrestling a decent end product out of Ehren Kruger's writing. He proved himself quite wrong. The actors do the best they can  and David Dorfman does a lot less sleepwalking in this episode  but I believe this film can be credited with killing off any chance of further Ringu adaptations.Of course  the acting is good enough to pass muster  as was the case in the previous Ring. Naomi Watts is a surprisingly competent actor  given that her credits include a stint on the Australian soapie I like to call Please Go Away. Once again  she goes through the standard motions expected of a Scream Queen with championship pride. All the clich\u00e9s are present and accounted for  but she shrugs them off like she is right at home in her environment. Then again  when one has worked for David Lynch  I suppose even creepy scenes such as the emergences of Samara from the TV set seem routine. However  when you get right down to it  Watts is the only real star in the film. Much was made of Sissy Spacek's role in the film  but it has turned out to be one of the most overstated walk-ons in the history of the genre. It was not until I viewed the IMDb credits for the film that I was even aware of her appearance in the film. David Dorfman  as previously intimated  has been given less of a zombie-like appearance in this film  but in so doing  his character also becomes a lot less interesting.The visual effects of the previous Ring were mainly limited to one instance of a girl crawling out of the television set  combined with some practical effects or trick editing. In this sequel  there are endless shots of water flowing in unnatural directions  people being sucked in and out of televisions  or people polymorphing. The plot feels like a blur  and I was only able to catch fragments relating to some lost relative of Samara's or how she is able to torment the family in spite of all the conditions being met in the first film for her to leave them be. In short  I was given little reason to care about the machinations that the central characters go through this time. Without a decent character to hang our cares upon  the film's sense of horror or terror literally falls apart. It does not help that we have no idea what the framework of rules regarding what Samara can or cannot do is meant to be.As I said  a previous commentator has stated that The Ring Two lacks everything that made The Ring good. Suspense? It is on the cutting room floor. Terror? The framework for it was never there to begin with. Horror? It appears the director would not know it if they were formally introduced. New lead Simon Baker tries his best  but Martin Henderson  his equivalent in the first American film  was able to make us care about his character. Partly because the screenplay seemed to be coherent  but also because he is able to act the part without resorting to clich\u00e9. Simon Baker is swimming uphill against a director who does not seem to care about building a structured plot  and a screenplay that has him speaking so unnaturally it is a wonder he did not cough up a boot during his scenes with David Dorfman. No matter how I try  I cannot think up a simple cause and effect pattern to the events in the film. It is literally a collage of scenes that are meant to be horrifying  but have no framework on which to hang.It is for this reason that I am giving The Ring Two a two out of ten. It is bad. Not bad enough to be good  but not good enough to be entertaining  either. It literally winds up in no man's land. See it if you can get it for free  but if there is something better on  such as a collection of You Can't Do That On Television repeats  watch that instead.\tI can't say I didn't like it but it wasn't that good either.Naomie Watts did another solid performance as Rachel Keller.A mother who moves to Seatle attempting to start a new life with her son who is now deeply interested in photography.Just like in the first film another victim dies in the beginning and Rachel yet again tries to find out how drive off the evil naughty girl Samara who is meanwhile possessing Rachel's son.At the end of the movie you'll walk out of the theatre feeling greatly disappointed.The plot was kinda pointless and the directing was not exactly suburb especially when you are expecting a lot from a master mind horror director Hadio Naketa.David Dorfman as Aiden went a little too far in terms of his creepy character and Elizibith Perkins did a short but satisfactory job as a doctor.Rachel has another boyfriend Max who ends out exactly like the first boyfriend did.Their relationship was poorly explained and again slightly pointless.Overall the whole idea of the second ring was sort of unnecessary.It didn't show the same horror and the same cleverness that was displayed in the first one.Don't expect THAT much from the Ring Two.Like I said it was not bad but not good either.\tThe Ring II as a sequel is not bad in that the main characters and story line are really continuous from the first movie. I was anxious to see this film as I had heard so many negative comments when the film was in the theater I was apprehensive that this was another bad sequel. I was pleasantly surprised that this movie has a soul of its own that carries on the creepiness of the original without a basic repeat of the first movie. The cinematography  score and special effects are top notch and the odd use of jerky motion by the ghost Tamara in the film add to the creepiness. The film is a gray toned film from start to finish which creates a dark foreboding atmosphere. I especially like the score for one very simple reason. It is a real orchestral piece without the usual tricks of screaming violins or corny three note horror harmonies to give away the suspense. The film takes itself seriously throughout and I think gives the element of credibility to the story. I was a bit surprised and disappointed at the anti-climatic ending however  and felt that a scarier ending probably would have made more sense. This movie and its predecessor are the first time in a long time I have actually watched a horror thriller where I genuinely was left a bit spooked out after watching it. If any movie can do that to me  I give it hearty credit.\tI've read quite a few reviews about The Ring Two on this site and agree with a lot of the negative aspects people have written  such as the lack of tension  the misplaced use and pointlessness of some of the special effects  Naomi Watts seemingly struggling to deliver the dialogue and convince us that she's got her heart in this film  and especially for me that annoying kid attempting and failing to be creepy who just won't stop saying \""Rachel  Rachel  Rachel\"". For Christ's sake we know her name alright!!! But....I'm a big fan of horror  in particular the Asian offering from the original Ring series to The Eye and Shutter  and I don't think they're always supposed to appear as straight forward as they first might (watch Hideo Nakata's Dark Water and then watch it again having talked about it with a major thinker....I did).As the Ring Two was directed by Hideo Nakata I just can't accept he went so wrong with it. I think as a 'scary movie' it fails  but as a concept it nearly works. I read the review by Fabrizio Bartolomucci from Rome titled 'A fractal movie'  and it got me thinking - Read it  it's on page three of the review list. In short  this writer suggests that the point of the film's imagery and sequences are there as a means to recreate the spooky video tape with Naomi and that annoying kid as the new stars  given that many of the events that happen to them mimic Samara and her mother's life. I think that's a pretty good point. It also made me think more about the tag-line...Fear Comes Full Circle....suggesting that The Ring and The Ring Two are two halves(semi circles)of the whole concept  where part two is designed to make you watch part one again  thus creating a Ring of it's own...us watching these movies over and over - a vicious circle! Obviosly this won't happen as part two is a bit crap in terms of entertainment value but I think the metaphors and symbolism presented are there for a good reason. I don't know if what i've just written makes perfect sense but if you read the guy from Rome's review  hopefully it will begin to.\tI heard from friends who went to the theaters to see this movie that it was really bad so I didn't buy the DVD. They were right. A friend who has Netflix let me watch this movie and I was so dissatisfied with it that I had to go to \""imdb\"" to find out who is responsible for this 1hr 50 minute waste of time. \""The Ring\"" is an American remake of a good Japanese horror flick just like \""The Grudge\"". \""The Ring Two\"" is unbearable until you get to the last few scenes. Movies lack the heart they had years ago. Now we have nothing but sequels to movies that weren't that good to begin with  and attempts to sum up TV shows with 2 hours of chaos. We're running out of ideas.\tOK  now 5 out of 10 I feel is being generous  but justified  as it relates only to the original story lines of this twisted tale! Praise to the original writers of RING... the story lines are fantastic...forgive me for being so \""bold\"" but I don't feel that \""hollywood\"" can capture it right. The ring was scary - it was new  bold and special effects made you go eek look at that!... but with the ring two you knew it was coming  it was replayed  therefore unsavory. Hollywood tends to make things look \""cooler\"".. by putting in tons of special effects.. scary music (supposedly lol).. etc. I watched this with the anticipation of looking away in fright and having wet my jeans.. similar effect to the ring 1.... but no such luck... lol... didn't even desire to lift my hands to cover up... was totally unscarifying.. in fact i've been more scared watching the Friday night forty lol....... the special effects in this movie... oh gosh.. like so cheaply done.. worse than the cgi tech of van helsing.. or the like of fantastic four.. i've seen optus ads been better done lol... peace out all... and sleep tight! (i'll see you tonight sam ;-) lol\tI really liked the original  The Ring  but this sequel was such a crushing disappointment. So many great stars  Elizabeth Perkins  Sissy Spacek  Gary Cole  etc.  but what a waste of talent and energy. Loads of cheap thrills  tricks  and pricey but pointless special effects. Frightening situations dissolve as characters awaken to find it was just a nightmare. And how exactly did evil Samara suddenly acquire the power of demonic possession? I thought this was The Ring  not The Exorcist. An extra on the DVD  a 15-minute encapsulation of what might have happened in the minutes before the sequel opens  is better than the movie itself. Sometimes I just don't understand the decisions that film editors make.\tDirector: Hideo Nakata  Novel: Koji Suzuki  Script: Ehren Kruger  Cast: Naomi Watts  David Dorfman  Simon Baker  Elizabeth Perkins  Gary Cole  Sissy Spacek.After the phenomenal success of The Ring  a sequel was inevitable. This time around  Hideo Nakata  the director of the original Japanese Ringu  was brought in. Naomi Watts and David Dorfman reprise their roles as Rachael and Aiden. This film was a true sequel in the sense that it does continue the story and not just repeat the same story again. Rachael took her son Aiden and moved from Seattle to start a new life in Astoria  Oregon. She now works as a reporter for a small newspaper there.When she investigates the death of a local teenage boy  she soon finds out that the notorious video tape was involved. Her nightmare is about to begin again! She goes to the house where the boy was killed to retrieve the tape which she burns. That evil girl spirit Samara is not content being a ghost. She wants to have a physical body and a mommy so she takes possession of Aiden.I felt this to be a decent follow up to the first film. While it doesn't capture the same creepiness and atmosphere of the first it does have its moments. Rainy  gloomy Astoria is a great location choice for such a film. I thought the scene in the restroom at the bazaar where Samara takes possession of Aiden was creepy. Also  the rather unique deer scene. Nakata and Kruger tried to give the audience a little more information on the background of Samara in this film  although it is all rather underdeveloped. In the previous  it was revealed that she was adopted. This time the identity of her real mother is revealed( played by the great actress Sissy Spacek) and why she gave her up. Although not as good as the original  this film does continue the story of Aiden and Rachael. Some of the effects from the first film such as the girl coming out of the t.v. just isn't as scary the second time around.\tMy neighbor bought this newly released DVD (unrated) from Walmart and I just pray that she can get a refund!!!In this sequel to The Ring we have the lead characters (Mom and creepy son) starting off in a new small  quaint  boring town. Already there is a \""murder\"" with a poor teenage girl left traumatized and speechless (this is actually the best part of the film with a great plot setup). Mom (Naomi Watts) is again working for a publication and stumbles upon this gruesome scene (she sees the victim's body)  puts two and \""Two\"" together and retrieves the tape and sets it ablaze ending the Samara saga \u0097 so she thinks.However  creepy  black and white  Samara  has other plans  she wants to live on earth and have a Mommy she can call her own  so she inhabits little Aidan's body (again with the creepy son that needs to get rid of some dark eye circles with good concealer). What is Mom to do. She is accused of abusing her now possessed son by Doctor of Psychiatry Elizabeth Perkins (completly wasted in this role). Mom goes off to find Samara's real birth mother; institutionalized Sissy Spacek (a very underused performance with a lot of potential to explain scary Samara)  and receives some motherly advice on how to save her son.Simon Baker plays the potential romantic interest that is trying to help Mom and son. Of course  experience has shown that any man trying to help Mom and son  dies \u0097 and he does.Mom and Samara battle for Aidan's soul/body/life and the film ends with Mom maybe finishing off Samara.The Ring Two should never have been released as it was. The DVD was an \""unrated\"" version that was \""not shown in theaters\"" that could have been shown on the SciFi channel without any editing. The acting is very good although we have some incredibly talented actors that were wasted in this film: Sissy Spacek  Naomi Watts  and Elizabeth Perkins. The subplot with Sissy Spacek as Samara's biological mother is very interesting  and has so much potential  it was very disappointing to me that it wasn't explored further and made to be the main plot of this sequel.There is still no explanation of Samara's powers  origin  or creepiness. And why the hell does she use video tape as her method of transmission into this realm? The best part of this new DVD release is the short film \""Rings\"". It is credited as tying the two movies together  although it does not. This short  which could be a full length thriller in its own right  shows the novelty and \""trip\"" that local teens have discovered that viewing this video can take them on. They use the internet and web blogs to chronicle their experiences with the tape  but no one has made it to Day 7 (you know that Day 7). Thus the setup for the beginning of this sequel and the fun commercial that was airing prior to the theatrical release of \""The Ring Two\"" that sucked viewers into thinking \""not another teen romance movie\"".I recommend that you wait for cable for this one. Don't waste your money on the DVD purchase  borrow it if you can  let someone else spend their cash. If they make another \""Ring\"" movie  I hope they get a new director.Also  the creepy  somewhat mystical kid  is so overused in film today that it actual underestimates the value of a good horror film.\t!Contains a few spoilers.!This movie is horrible  I thought of it as more of a comedy then a horror. The scene with the Elk was quite in my mind hilarious  they looked so fake that I debated if I should shut the movie off due to lack of interest. Once again another horror movie is butchered by a sequel. Will directors ever learn? People are asking \""Will there be another The Ring movie?\"" I hope not  but then again if I'm in a Comedy mood I will have a movie to rent. Two hours of repeating themselves and proving nothing but the complete obvious. If Samara comes back I will forget the Horror movies and just move on to something else.If your scared easily by fake looking Elk or mind-numbing babble then DO NOT rent this movie  but if your looking for a good laugh I recommend it.\tThough the storyline in this sequel is not as cohesive as in \""The Ring\""  the visual aspects of this film are stellar  perhaps even more than in the original  and hold the viewer frozen in front of the screen. The same stunning images of the original cursed tape still work perfectly and the effects used in the sequel are great. Set in Astoria  Oregon it not only is a wonderfully spooky tale  but the backdrop of the Pacific northwest is perfect. But the highlight of this film is still the incredibly spooky little girl Samara  who may be the creepiest kid since the original Exorcist ! The supplemental material \""Rings\"" contained on the DVD is a must see after watching the movie. A fun and worthwhile watch. Be sure to see it in the dark !\tThere are inevitable disappointing drawbacks to this sequel  taking place only a few months after the first Ring(02)  tho the kid is obviously quite older. A level of dread is there from the very beginning but it never escalates. It sort of stays at the same beat throughout: Watts  back as Rachel  doesn't go on a journey of discovery here  uncovering further layers of horror. She already knows all about the tape and so do we. Yes  she does uncover further information about Samara  that now-tiresome spirit which doesn't go away and leave her and her son alone  but it's clich\u00e9. And then  midway  the only truly surprising sequence involves a sudden switch to the 'eco-terror' movies of the seventies  this time with killer deer. Say what? It's more hysterical than terrifying: the computer FX here don't work very well in sections of the sequence  as if rushed. And deer are the last animals I would pick to be scary; maybe that was the intent (the least expected animals) but it doesn't work for me. It was a central set piece and removing it probably wasn't an option. The rest of the pic  involving a form of possession  isn't anything new to horror and is even tedious. What's weird is after a saw this sequel  it suddenly occurred to me that the 'ring' may also refer to the phone ringing; but that may be because I watched the first Ring again.\tI'm not sure why the distribution company made such a big fuss over this version being unrated..but I gotta tell you this is a fairly tame movie. Especially if you compare it to the first movie. There is no real gore  nudity  or violence.The best thing about this movie is the Cameos and not much else. Elizabeth Perkins plays a shrink  Gary Cole has a minor role as a real estate agent  and Sissy Spacek plays Sarama's birth mother. Good cameos  but unfortunately  thats all they are. No character is developed in any way - not even the ghost.I didn't think it was worth the money to spend - its slow and boring. I just wanted to see the history of Sarama  but the movie just breezes thru who she is and why she's haunting Naomi Watts' character Rachel.Overall  this movie does not meet my expectation for scary / horror. It just doesn't have the fear factor in it of the original. However  if you get the DVD and watch the little mini-film called \""Rings\""  you'll be scared half out of your mind!\tDespite what I have heard from other users and many other people who have seen the Ring Two  I am sorry to say that I really disagree with all of you... The effects were great  and many people don't seem to see what the connection between the horses and the deer are in this film and the last..... If you can recall   Samara makes the horses go crazy  so off course when they move... since Samara has followed them... she makes the deer go crazy... see? THE CONNECTION!!!!!... okay and I have to say  this movie may not have built suspense  but when you least expected it  something scary happening  for example: a noise or something that moved  and of course the music selection was great... making me on edge because scary music= scary happenings!... This movie was great switching the whole story around  and to connect the two movies  they incorporated the movie that kills you into it!!!... but then made it a seemingly whole new movie... It was a very good movie despite what u all think.! ~~NIKKI\tthe first two Japanese rings(which are directed by Hideo Nakata) were OK  the third one as i see it it was junk. Now  i believe Hideo Nakata after the Japanese rings  wanted to change the story. well it was disappointing. it didn't lead me anywhere important about the whole Samara thing. if although you are a maniac about \""the Ring\"" then i would recommend it to you but if you liked the first ring which indeed was perfect and you just want to learn more about Samara i wouldn't recommend it to you. at the cinema would just a waste of time and money  at home... maybe you 'ill like it. i really hope there is a third one because then \""The Ring Two\"" is just another horror junk film\tWow where do I begin with this review? If there ever was a Most Unnecessary Sequel title it goes to this piece of garbage. I mean I never saw this flick in the theaters since I didn't care for the first one which was slow boring and incredibly not scary. So I waited for the sequel since it was going to be Unrated on DVD and so I wouldn't have to waste my time driving to a theater if it was bad. Now I want my rental money back. Whoever thought this movie was better than the first  must have taste in their ass. What the hell was Unrated? This movie was pointless! I mean was it really necessary to drag out the movie to two freaking hours? I mean come on. This movie has no jumps  no scares  no point. I mean am I the only one who thought the acting was poop too? I mean Naomi Watts was nominated for an Academy Award but from her acting in the first half you wouldn't have known.The whole deer scene was pointless and filmed bad..I mean after the first attack through the side windows check out Naomi's side...window still there and not for just a shot. I mean it's almost like they kept adding to the scene after it was complete. Plus the CGI was really bad. Here is a tip producers...if it doesn't look real...don't add it! Trust me it didn't improve the movie  just wasted more time getting to the pointless conclusion. Speaking of which...what was the point? Just to close the *bleeping* well? I mean this movie went against the point of the first. All of a sudden its like Poltergeist  doors opening and other stupid crap we've seen in good horror movies. Plus the hospital abuse scene was ripped off from Wes Cravens New Nightmare. Even as i type this...I don't understand why they spent money on such a unneeded sequel and it's a shame when an extra on the DVD called Rings is better than the actual movie. I would much rather have seen a full blown movie version of that.I read a review on Ringu 2 which read it was long  boring  not scary and a waste of time  I think they meant that review for The Ring Two. If you have no taste and actually get disturbed and scared from this  enjoy. Please never see a movie I make  but if you actually understand good film making and respect the genre  then don't spend a dime to watch this. Luv Mom."""
The Shawshank Redemption (1994),"This was the first movie that I remember as a little kid. When I saw it  i was captivated by the perfect acting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. I thought all the prisoners were actually prisoners serving life sentences. It was the first Steven King movie I've ever seen  and it gave me the wrong impression about his type of movies.The movie is about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is convicted of murdering his wife and the man she was having an affair with. Andy is sent to jail were he tries to survive a new life behind bars. The movie shows his struggles with the inmates and prison officials. His closest friend being Red (Morgan Freeman) also shares those same struggles as Andy. And the movie has the most powerful ending of any movie I've ever seen.I can say that everyone that has seen this movie truly loves it for every aspect of it. The Acting  directing  and writing  etc.\tI simply fail to understand how this film is so popular... it's quite simply beyond me. The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of King's short story found it very true to the spirit of the book  and voted 10 for that. I really could not find anything worth my time in this film  and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end  one or two good lines of dialog and the acting  there's really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for. It's about hope... and the director won't let us forget it  so it's repeated until the audience mumbles it in our sleep. It's like this short  one-note story was written  and the author just didn't want to end it... so he kept writing... and writing... until someone had the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yelling \for the love of all that is holy  stop writing!\"" And I thank that faceless man for doing that  because it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was 142 minutes long  and not 284  or  dare I say it  568. The film simply drones on and on  scene after scene  containing nothing remotely interesting(but with excellent acting  mind you). There's nothing good about this film except for the acting. Just about all of it is great. I can't really think of anything else to say... I guess my dislike for the film stems from my hatred of King's writing. I suppose it is possible for someone who is neutral on his works to enjoy this film. I recommend this to fans of Stephen King  the actors and possibly Frank Darabont. If you're not a fan of any of these people  I doubt you'd find this enjoyable. 5/10\tIf there is one word which entails the entire message of this film  it is HOPE. Though I have never been a Stephen King fan  this is one story which makes him deserve accolades over and over again. When I was watching the movie  halfway through it  I admit I was bored. And when Tommy (Gil Bellows) was shot  I was like \""Who the hell recommended me this movie??\"". But still I just wanted to get this movie over with  so I watched further. And when that scene comes where the warden throws a pebble at the poster and it tears right through!!! My God!!! My mouth was agape the whole time!!! What a fantastic ending!. The movie indeed has the best finale in cinematic history.(The Usual Suspects comes a close second..). Performances were superb.. (..I still think Tim Robbins deserved a nomination more than Morgan Freeman..). The wardens were damn good as the tormentors. But overall  I believe the story itself deserves a special place in the annals of great cinema!!!\tThe Shawshank redemption is the first Frank Darabont's movie which has taken 7 Oscar-nominations from the Academy but the film not yielded a high profit.Why not? Well the story of this movie is too good to be true.The Shawshank redemption is based on the book by Stephen King and certainly this is the most brilliant adaptation which has ever based from the writer'novels. The playtime is rather long but seems to be not boring.It's excellently produced and the acting(Tim Robbins and especially Morgan Freeman)is marvellous.The script is clever enough about the human's relationships and the escape from the prison.The characters and the story itself are clearly true.\tI had originally owned this film on VHS. It grew on me to where I was watching it nearly once a week. The tape had gotten so bad that I could no longer enjoy the film. i have replaced my VHS tape with the 10th year anniversary two-disc special edition and i have really enjoyed the many extras made available. The commentaries from Tim Robbins  Morgan Freeman and others contribute so much more that i would recommend to the first time viewer  if there are any  to view these bonus tracks prior to the movie. The extras sell the film all over again. I continue to watch this film a couple of times a month. The film lifts my spirits and jump starts my soul. Thank you Frank Darabont. oh  and Stephen King for a great experience with this film which has become one of my all time favorites...\tWe were supposed to read The Shawshank Redemption book for English class  at first my classmates (also myself) thought that this would be a boring story. We were wrong. The book is incredible  stephen king is a genius  but moreover  the movie was brilliant  never before in my life I've seen such movie with an excellent plot  excellent actors and an excellent direction  this is by far one of the greatest movies of all time (along with a clockwork orange)  I'm just a fan of it  here in Chile we don't get to see many books by this author but what the hell  a great book and a excellent movie  should be considered the greatest movie of all time :D\tIt's an \""emotional manipulation for dummies\"" type of film  with boring direction and cardboard characters. Nice performances by the actors though  some great moments  but nothing outside the \""Hallmark meets Stephen King meets Prison\"" feel of the entire movie.I saw it one and a half times  and would see it again only if I got paid for the trouble.Similarly  I hated 'The Green Mile\""  only later did I find out it's the work of Darabont.My recommendation: Skip this  and go see OZ again.\twhy is this movie considered a classic....someone please make a reasonable argument to explain this.I've seen it several times and my opinion of it remains the same. nothing special about the direction cinematography is only OK  acting is good  screenplay is inferior to an already average short story (film is nearly 3 hrs long....totally up its own anus) and it contains every prison film clich\u00e9 in the book. people like it because of its triumph over adversity theme (man winning against impossible odds  human spirit unbroken......zzzzzzzzzzzz) its been done b4 especially in Hollywood and much better (cuckoos nest).this AVERAGE movie has got to be near the top of the list of most overrated films ever made.\tRarely has a director connected so well to the spirit of a story  and with the impeccable work of Morgan Freeman  whose narration is nothing short of perfect  and Tim Robbins' everyman  \""Shawshank\"" delivers an almost perfect film. Frank Darabont has opened up the short story and created a work that explores what lurks in the souls of people. He has added details that allow us to understand how the human spirit manages to survive in the worst of conditions. He also shows us that beauty lies in just about any place in this world.The film moves very well  taking us for a long and rewarding ride. Characters age and evolve  discovering how their relationships with others always have consequences. Tim Robbins remains at the center  and he becomes  for most of the film  an observer  our representative in a world that could destroy you if you let it.We relate to the men of \""Shawshank\"" because they are our representatives in a microcosm of society. We observe as we participate and see our reflections in a mini study of emotions and mind games.\tI would humbly suggest that before praising or damning the \""Shawshank Redemption\""  that one take a considered look at the New York Times \""Best 1000 Films Ever Made\"" list. Unfortunately  the guidelines of this site preclude me oh gentle reader  from giving you the URL. One should be able to Google it  so all is not lost.The NYT was good enough to excerpt the list from Peter Nichols' The \""New York Times Guide to the 1 000 Best Films Ever Made\"".What ? The \""Shawshank Redemption\"" is not on this list  you say ?Perhaps  humble viewer  you haven't seen enough films of the first rank. But  have no fear  this is a remediable condition. But  be a dear and do try to see some of the movies on the list please  before voting on this site. I really hate to see so many people make the mistake of voting for the wrong sort of movies onto the top 10 of IMDb's very interesting site. It's ever so declasse.Remember  an educated public is an informed public. Now  do your part.\tThe Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt my favourite film of all time. Ranked 2 in the top 250 films it is clear others agree with me. And when you watch this you will too. The plot may sound familiar (guy goes to jail  guy escapes jail) but this is nothing like i have seen before. It's about Andy Dufresnes (Tim Robbins) determination and persistence which keeps him going through his 19 years. But the film is also about Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman) commonly known as \""Red\"". He does not claim innocence and is the only guilty man in Shawkshank. When Dufresne arrives Red makes a bet he'd be first to crack. But Andy stays strong which surprises Red. He uses this strength to keep going day after day and he passes this feeling onto Red when he tells him of a box planted under the tree. This gives Red some hope  It gives him something to look forward to and that will keep him going day by day. Without Andy Red would have nothing in life. And when you have nothing in life like Brooks did... There is nothing to keep you going onto the next day. This film is brilliantly scripted. The acting is top class and you get the feel of the innocent man amongst the guilty. The corrupt guards and wardens add to Andys story of wrong convictions and unfairly treated. He just happens to be the only innocent man in Shawshank.\tIt's predictable from the first to the last minute. I can't believe it's second in worldwide history. Well... first is other predictable movie (The Nerd of the Ring). This situation reminds me of Brave New World. One of the future citizens in there goes to a theater to see a movie with \""the savage\"". The future and civilized man (or woman  I don't remember) is fascinated with it. But the Savage tries to make him notice that the plot was a truly rubbish  truly predictable and truly untruly. Now  what's the problem? ALL THE MOVIES ARE EQUALS. So  the future one can't distingue and decide in a correct way. He has NO OPTION. That's what is going on here. And not only in movies...\tThe first time I saw \""The Shawshank Redemption\"" I was only 12. At the time I was amazed at how a movie could present so much emotion. As I have grown  my taste in movies has also. Still  I rank \""Shawshank\"" as my favorite film  the one that I could watch every day for the rest of my life. If you have not seen this film  I pity you. Do not just rent it at your local Blockbuster. I implore you step away from your computer  go out to the nearest store  and buy this movie. Not only do Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give performances that will make you question your humanity  but you will most definitely learn something that will benefit you as a person. So  if you are yet to see this film  you must (in the words of Andy)  \""Get busy livin'  or get busy dyin'.\""\tThe performance by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins in this movie is so incredible realistic that you are really ought to believe this story is true  as said in the end. Not just a 'one-to-watch'  the best movie ever  which  in my honest opinion  beats the godfather with ease! I cannot tell anything about the movie  because I'll mess up the story for the ones that haven't seen the movie yet  but believe me  the twist in the end of the movie  it's just fascinating... The whole person of Dufresne is fascinating  the calmth in his whole appearance  the way he's living his life in jail  in one word fascinating. The same thing goes for Morgan Freeman though  it is just incredible  wonderful  fascinating... Just... Just watch it. You'll love it.\tWhen you get two life sentences  maybe you are in total despair especially you are innocent. But the banker Andy was not. He still had a hope for his future. He thought every possible way to get out of the prison. When the hope that recovered his innocence openly broke out  he decided to escape from the prison with his way. He was quite a smart person. Even his friend Red did not know his escape plan. He did it. So Red too. Their reunion at the beach was the warmest scene in the movie.Although the movie got many academy nominees  it got nothing in the end. However it won the heart of people. I think that its positive connotation is enough to move every one. That is why it is still so popular after 11 years. We should not abandon hope at any circumstance. Without hope  without future.Tim Robbins convincingly played the sympathizing banker. His another impressive movie was The player. Morgan Freeman should have won the academy award. If that happened  he did not have to wait 11 years to get the award (best supporting actor for Million dollar baby).A movie can bring you hope. 8/10\tThe first time I saw the movie I was crazy about it .I did not want to speak to anyone nor do anything .I wanted to rise my arms and cry ---yes  just like what Andy did .It really inspires me greatly .I believe it is a terrific film because it includes all things a film should have. The plot   the characters the director the spirits are all top.So I want to see it for another time .Then I find out that I don't like the oaks which stands for power and strength .Why can't the letter just between two brisks. It's obvious the director wanna tell us something in a obvious way. But it's not serious this is quite personal. I still know what I can get from this movie. The more I see it  the more I get .I know Andy deserves the happy ending  will he succeed in the real world?\tAfter watching this movie  you come to think about how important and valuable your freedom really is.I think everyone should watch this movie. The story is very well shown and played  the actors were amazing and I didn't see any failure except that eventually  the end goes by really fast  but maybe it's better like this  when the happy things aren't described  your imagination can make the most wonderful story out of it.On the not so good series  I'd point the captain of the guards  who seemed to have some good feelings at some moments of the movie  and who ended killing the young guy in such a pitiful and disappointing way. Also the director of Shawshank died without getting what he should have receive for being such a bastard  which was quite unfair.But well  the worst punishment you could get  is not physical  nor material  it's when you discover you ruined your life  and lost your time.I gave this movie a 9  because nobody and nothing is perfect.I can guarantee that you won't regret watching this  even if it takes away 2 hours of your free time  this movie could make you realize how to spend the remaining ones of your life in the most clever way.GO FREEDOM ! :-)\tWhen Andy Dufresne  a young and successful banker  discovers his wife in bed with another man his life takes a dramatic turn for the worse. When the lovers' bodies are discovered  shot repeatedly with bullets from a gun linked to Andy  he becomes wrongly imprisoned. Sent to a maximum security prison run by a corrupt and over-zealous religious warden he struggles to hang on to hope of returning to the outside world and reclaiming a sense of normality. After a period of isolation he finally approaches one of the other inmates  a convict called Red who is the only person in Shawshank Prison guilty of their crime. What begins as a business partnership between two characters  who would be unlikely to cross paths in the real world  quickly turns into a lifelong friendship. Together they manage to fight impossible odds to survive and prove that both hope and the possibility for redemption never die.I have heard many people rave about 'The Shawshank Redemption' over the years but have only just gotten around to watching it myself  and the praise heaped upon this film scarcely do it justice. This is not just the story of a man wrongly imprisoned  or the astonishing reality of life behind bars  but an emotional drama which reels you in from the onset. The movie is quite lengthy however I found myself unable to press the stop button as the level of interest was maintained steadily throughout  and I kept wanting to \""watch a bit more\"". It has been a long time since I have actually cried while watching a film or sat on the edge of my seat literally in suspense  but 'The Shawshank Redemption' managed to make me do both.The characters are what make this movie brilliant and the casting of Morgan Freeman as Red and Tim Robbins as Andy was spot on. They managed to convince me that I was watching real life and actual circumstances rather than just a realistic portrayal of the prison world. Their reactions and behaviour were original but suited the film  and really highlighted how easy it can be to become a victim but that you do not have to accept that role forever.I felt inspired by the ideas raised and loved how my mind was encouraged to consider certain beliefs and rules in society. This movie challenges some of the toughest issues facing us in the modern age  even though the film was set over a period from the 1940's \u0096 1980's. Frank Darabont has produced an excellent movie which does not disappoint in any way. I would recommend 'The Shawshank Redemption' to anyone over the age of about 15 as a brilliant and enlightening drama.\tI bought this film just due to its high score on IMDb. I was not disappointed. My comment to my wife after seeing this  was \""nothing actually happened  but I could still not take my eyes from the screen\"". This movie works like emotional magic to a guy who normally swears to action  horror and FX movies. Hats off to the actors  the script writer and the director.And no hats off to the IMDb people who make me write 10 lines. I don't care if I'm banned from writing more reviews by adding these final meaningless lines. I've used IMDb since it was born  and this is the first time I've actually felt like telling the world a movie is worth watching. It's probably also the last time  so just ban me from commenting further.\tI like this movie for the following reasons. first its screen play is perfect. The hero acted in a correct fashion. He lived the character. Through out the movie he displays a balanced mind. I like the movie because it talks about hope and how hope will bring happiness. I always used to think about it when ever I lose hope in doing some work or in solving my own problems. The two characters Hero and his friend were shown of opposite in nature. Hero always talks about hope and his friend talks opposite to hope. This makes me feel what really life will be without hope and with hope. One more thing It teaches is It does not matter where we are but what we do."""
The Skeleton Key (2005),"The Skeleton Key is one of those movies thats spooky rather than scary. It uses the rich backdrop of New Orleans voodoo to build this great atmosphere  and then doesn't really do anything with it. Good performances all around  especially from Kate Hudson  but the film suffers from a very predictable plot. There's a twist at the end of the movie  as there almost always is in these movies  but its telegraphed it so far in advance that you're bored by the time they actually reveal what happened. Much more 'The Village' then 'The Others' or 'The Sixth Sense'. As other reviewers noted the film does win points for having really good final five minutes.\tAfter a slightly slow start  'Skeleton Key' develops into an original  evocative and at times genuinely scary occult thriller so Ehren Kruger has redeemed himself after his truly wretched script for 'Ring 2' . I am not going into spoilers  which would be extremely destructive for a film of this kind but there are very clever character shifts  achieving a wonderful tension lock for the last 40 minutes or so mainly because all the performances are so good. The use of props and flash-backs is also wonderfully rich. The setting is contemporary New Orleans and its surrounds but this is mythical south and none the worse for that. The mix of influences includes 'Turn of the Screw'  'Rosemary's Baby' 'Burn Witch Burn and a few other classics but that is to give nothing away for it absorbs them into something quite new. My only criticism would be there is something a little confined about the movie--especially at its start-- but its style and pace and excitement utilise this triumphantly by the end.\tokay.....the acting was great but the actual movie? kind of lame. it starts out extremely suspenseful  but is soon lost when the plot comes into play. i can say that i got freaked out and jumped out of my chair a few times  but this was only because of the shock value. i would rate this movie 5/10 and would not see it again. for anyone wanting a good scare i wont recommend this. but for anyone just wanting to waste an afternoon or anyone who enjoys crazy twists...this is a pretty decent movie for you. personally i would rather watch: the ring house of wax or unbreakable. i think that m.night shamillianillan whatever guy is the master of twists. the village was kind of slow  but if you're wide awake and involved  its an effed up movie to say the least. i love house of wax i don't see why everyone has to hate it. it scared me so so much. mostly because of the gore and like the brutal murders etc. by the way  the skeleton key had NO gore or death or anything. i think the freakiest part is when Kate Hudson goes to that gas station and turns around to see the blind old lady with the baby. that was scary as hell! the scariest part in either or the rings is whenever you see one of those dead faces. like that is extremely messed up. finally i think that the scariest part in house of wax is when Jared padalaecki or whatever gets his face like partially ripped off. like EW!\tSaw this movie during the last month at a premiere - and  originally  was not expecting much - discovered some interesting jumps and frights throughout the movie.Much is being made about the similarities to the 70's genre of movies - which I would agree to the overall concept - same kind of pacing as you would see in Halloween and Friday the 13th - without the jumpy slice and dice parts.Other movies I would add to the mix would be Wes Craven's \The Serpent and the Rainbow\"" - with the same mix of voodoo and jumps in that vein. Kate Hudson makes an excellent  thoughtful turn in the movie - and well-played through-out.All I can say is take the movie in - without trying to figure out the answer to the puzzle - and let the show wash over you. You will find the story quite satisfying...SPECIAL NOTE: check out the the website theskeletonkey.com - some very good hidden snippets there - check out the floor  the forest  and the hanging set of bones...\tHaving seen the lacklustre trailer for this film  I wouldn't have bothered to see it at the cinema if it wasn't for some very positive reviews here in the UK. It isn't the most original film and the ending  while good  isn't gob-smacking. But it is very well shot and has some strong acting performances in it. Kate Hudson is particularly good as the inquisitive nurse. Her character generally doesn't need to be told things twice and I liked the way her thought processes appeared logical. I felt like she was doing what I'd have done in her circumstances. I've never been to the Southern USA  but the sets and locations felt very atmospheric. I'm sure to folks from those parts it looked a bit hackneyed  but to a UK viewer it felt mysterious and brooding. Overall  a very enjoyable was to spend an hour and a half. See it in the cinema  as I feel that the pacing and atmosphere could be lost on a small screen in a living room.\tThis was another sneak preview night at our local theater. You have no idea what you are going to see. This one took about 10 minutes before folks started walking out. Yep  it is pretty bad. Great scenery at the outset of the movie of the Bayou. Movie is standard horror flick type. Wait for the DVD. Kate Hudson tries a new role in this one but it doesn't work. Good cast but the script and story line are much in need. How can Hollywood keep putting out so much junk this year  this one goes right to the front of the pack in making films that must be made to fulfill contracts for the actors. Don't know the budget for this one but it was way to much.\tVery atmospheric  fairly well scripted with only a couple of clunky lines  John Hurt was fantastic  the twist was pretty simple to spot but well executed.Also  to the reviewer that complained about the lack of ghosts...well  the \""ghosts\"" weren't really there as the hoo doo couple were still alive.If it had been ghosts of past victims however  would have made more sense.Finally  there was the obligatory scene with the heroine taking a shower. I wasn't complaining but my girlfriend did :)\tWhile not a horrible movie  \""Skeleton Key\"" disappoints with its lack of a substantial plot and failure to use its setting to create a spooky atmosphere. The story felt like a rehash of the Oliver Reed-Bette Davis film \""Burnt Offerings \"" except a lot more predictable. It's always bad to have the audience figuring things out ahead of the protagonist but in the case of this film  the big twist is apparent roughly fifteen minutes into the movie -- and Hudson is playing catch up for the rest of the running time. John Hurt is utterly wasted in the role of a paralyzed stroke victim -- which begs the question  why cast him? Aren't there any wonderful older stage actors who could have played it just as well? Why put a star in a silent part?\tI went to go see the Skelenton Key with some friends  it's summer a 'scary' movie at night with your friends is what your supposed to do but this movie wasn't that great! i will admit that i jumped every once and a while but so would anyone with the loud sound effects and the big screen sometimes that's all you can do.Now the story had some real potential to be interesting and scary but potential isn't enough to carry the movie. The beginning was WAY to long and the middle was confusing and the end WAY to short  the ending kind of just falls on your lap and then you get up and leave the theater. It all happened either to fast or to slow and nothing was REALLY explained so you leave the movie disappointed and confused.I wouldn't recommend this movie not even to rent don't waste your money wait for it to turn up on the T.V. one of these days.\tI saw a special screening of The Skeleton Key last week and from the trailers  I was hoping for a really good flick! I was a bit disappointed  however  in that the movie was quite slow... I really wanted more scares  ghosts  anything to make me jump  but it just wasn't there. Movies such as The Ring and The Grudge had a MUCH more scary influence on me than this movie did.The story itself was interesting especially if you are into that kind of deep south bayou  voodoo  magic stuff.The best part of the movie is the ending which makes up for the slowness of the film and really brings together all that had happened up to that point. Walking out of the film I felt like everything finally made sense.I would recommend seeing this movie if nothing else looks good. Just don't expect it to be as scary as the trailers portray.\tI saw this yesterday and I have to say I was impressed. I didn't actually read up on it beforehand but I kind of gathered from a trailer I remember seeing on TV that it was about a creepy looking house and spooky ghosts. However when the film began I quickly realised it wasn't just another horror film. In fact to be honest it wasn't all that scary but that doesn't make it a bad film. It's possibly being pushed to hard as a horror film and many fans of films such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre  Scream  Halloween will be disappointed for sure as it's a slasher film. Apart from a flash back no one dies. Instead it reminds me very much of films like The Grudge  Ring and Dark Water in that it moves at a slow pace with a few spooks here and there (Caused mainly by sound bangs). What sets this film apart though is that the storyline is very clever and the story progressed along nicely leaving you guessing for a few things. The 'twist' ending that everyone seems to be going on about never really seemed like a twist ending  merely a revealing of the true characters however it wasn't something that was unexpected or totally absured that it didn't fit. It managed to fit perfectly and not make the viewer feel cheated as the signs were there all along for you to work. Overall I would recommend this film to people but let them know well in advance it's not some slasher flick but merely a clever eerie story.\tI recently saw this film and have to admit I was surprised. I did not go in expecting much  but as I enjoy the cinema I figured why not? I am a fan of the four leads and it can't be that bad if they accepted the roles. I have to say that what followed was very good  the acceptance of the actors making a lot more sense.It is refreshing to not have gore be what constitutes horror. I would classify the film more along the lines of a psychological thriller  like 'Seven' (though this film isn't as brilliant as Fincher's masterpiece  it does stay with you after the credits). This film was one made which seemed to respect the audience  which now isn't done very often  especially in horror.Yes  the Southern/N'Awlins clich\u00e9s are rampant  but not used just because. The clich\u00e9s do actually effect the story. There is a reason they used that city as the film's setting and the mythology of the city is almost another character. I myself am from the South in the USA and have been to New Orleans. I know how much the culture of Hoodo and Voodo effects the lives of most natives to the city  even if they don't believe.And the typical pretty girl sticking her nose where she shouldn't horror stereotype comes in the form of Kate Hudson's character. What is different in this 'horror' film is that the four leads can actually act. I found myself caring for Kate's character and for John Hurt's character. Hudson's performance as the caring  non-believer  Yankee nurse is convincing and she doesn't treat the belief of her employers  like a silly superstition. She actually respects the belief while not accepting it herself. John Hurt's performance being for me the highlight of the film  he is always brilliant and was so in this. Conveying so much without words is always an acting challenge and one that Hurt met and conquered with grace. Gena Rowlands was fantastic in very role  which shifts in character almost imperceptibly from sweet old Southern lady to evil oppressive wife to the surprise twist. Peter Saarsgard's Southern estate lawyer was perfectly slimy and sexy at the same time.The mystery's resolution  though expected  still was done quite well. The ending  when the 'shock' twist comes and all is revealed was very refreshing. All in all the film used voodoo horror stereotypes to its advantage and very effectively.If you want slasher and gore  go see 'Devil's Rejects'  but if you want to be treated with some deal of respect and see a film which will have you still thinking about it when you leave the theatre  go see 'Skeleton Key.'\tI'm a big fan of horror movies so I was keen to go along to see this. However I was extremely disappointed. It seems that once again they took all the 'scarey' bits and lumped them together for the trailer. Yet again I was suckered in by the hype. The cast were good  and the idea itself was good  but I came away from the movie thinking that they could have done so much more with it. If anyone was thinking of going along to see this  I would say keep your money in your pocket. What a waste of the talent when you have an actor like John Hurt and fail to use him to his potential. Yes he was good  but it could have been so much more. And as for making you jump? Where were the scares? Precious little as far as I can see.\tIt has an interesting concept and atmosphere  but I think they could used it a lot better. It's more a psychological thriller than terror  and it doesn't use too much those \""high noises from the music\"" to scare people  which I think this it's better than the rest. Kate Hudson does an OK job  and the rest of the cast too.The beginning of the final act  with the first \""surprise\""  looks a bit weird and stupid  but the final twist gives to the movie another point of view. I liked it  I think it worked  but I would prefer another kind of result for the movie instead of this one. If you accept the rules of the movie  and the rules of the end  it will work  but it's not the final story I'd wish.So  like I said  it's not great  but it's worth watching.Looks like this time in Spain we're luckier than you in this release date.\tI only saw this movie for the first time last Friday so it should be fairly fresh in my mind. Strangely though it isn't.Now I wouldn't class it as instantly forgettable but neither is it unmissable. The atmosphere of New Orleans is the best thing about it. If you've seen \""Angel Heart\"" with Mickey Rourke you'll know what I mean. Kate Hudson gives an enjoyable performance as the feisty nurse who goes to take care of stroke victim John Hurt. Hurt's wife  played by Gena Rowlands  steels the show with a genuinely spooky performance. The plot takes too long though to wriggle its way out of the ghostly atmosphere of the New Orleans haunted house and the climax of the film is just too predictable. There are one ot two superfluous characters also who only delay the progress of the skeleton thin plot. Probably best to wait till it comes out on DVD.\tI expected this to be quite a scary film with all the voodoo magic and story line in the film  unfortunately the film has a limited 'jolt' factor and not enough scares. The Spirits in the film are under used  as is the use of mirrors (you'll have to watch the film)  after such a huge buildup on the 'mirror' factor  it was definitely underused  and could have made quite a few more scenes much more interesting..The film starts of with a rather slow beginning and a rather rapid/rushed ending. It is also quite predictable  and I could see where it was going pretty much from the very beginning.. although quite clever in parts  its all been done before and is the usual recycled stuff Hollywood churns out every few years in another form.Kate Hudson plays her usual arrogant self  with the film revolving around her desire to look after/protect the old man she is meant to be caring for at the expense of her own safety.... not bloody likely  when you see half the stuff that's going on in that house! I'm surprised it didn't go straight to DVD  and it looks like it got an earlier release in the UK than the US  I don't know why that was  possibly testing the waters in a smaller market to save it from a big flop in the US? well have to wait and see..For a voodoo film I'd say its quite good  a few good spells here and there  if your expecting a horror you might be slightly disappointed  but for a drama/thriller/mystery its quite good I suppose  for a real scare watch 'The Descent' which has a much higher 'jolt' factor if you're into that kind of thing!\tI was expecting this movie to be a typical horror flick that I would be able to predict the entire way through.However  I was actually pleasantly surprised...I really like the fact that I was managed to be spooked in most places as the effects were very impressive.The cast(especially Kate Hudson) were superb in creating that 'eerie' quality that you can really experience whilst at the cinema...and as a group they really unpredictably meshed well together.Overall...for the twist (at the very end) alone  I'd recommend this movie to anyone that wants to be entertained for 90minutes....even if it is to spill their popcorn every time the 'horror' factor kicks in....I'll never look at brick dust in the same way again.\t'The Skeleton Key' is a far better movie than many have given credit for. I was not expecting much  which does admittedly help  but I was rather surprised by the tension. It has many similarities to hundreds of other movies in the spooky house genre  but seems to stride over and above clich\u00e9s  and actually makes the situation appear fresh. With a good combination of spooky horror and tension  it does hold the attention all the way through  and it does have a genuinely original ending. It reminded me of 'The Others' which I didn't generally like  although that also had a good conclusion. 7 out of 10. John Hurt adds weight to his mute character  but it is Kate Huson who keeps you enthralled  much as Michelle Pfeiffer did so well in 'What Lies Beneath'. I have not always liked her  possibly because she didn't look much like her Mother (!) but  with age  (all of 25?) she now has a lot of her Mum's charm and cuteness. There is one scene  near the end  when I actually found myself saying: 'Get out  Goldie'! She had me fooled for a second. And anyway  anyone who looks like Goldie is always going to get my vote. Forget the negative reviews. This movie is a good popcorn-dropping chiller.\tI went today to see this film without any expectations and I liked it. All I can say is that it's worth the time spent to watch it. Of course  everything in this movie is average  but not bad. The claustrophobic atmosphere of the house and people hiding the truth until the end are similar elements to the ones in Amen\u00e1bar's The Others. And the ending was really unexpected for me.There's not much more for me to say about this movie  except remarking that it's worth to spend the evening on it.P.D.: After watching this movie I won't forget to pour some brick dust out of my room to keep the evil out :-) Just joking.\tHired to care for a stroke victim on an isolated plantation  hospice worker Caroline begins to suspect her patient's wife is responsible for his condition. Armed with a key that opens every door in the house  she uncovers a dark history of black magic  voodoo and ritual sacrifice.This gloriously silly ghost yarn is enjoyable thanks to an above-average cast and a script from The Ring's Ehren Kruger. However  Hudson is given little chance to display her natural vivacity  while the ending is beyond ludicrous but overall  it's a camp spookfest that's more entertaining than some of the horror movies doing the rounds."""
The Upside of Anger (2005),"Aggression is something that many of us have not only felt  but have seen change other people. It is a human theme and it is therefore easy to connect to when it is shown screen. For this reason  a number of viewers will perhaps take well to this film. However  those same people would take well to an average run-of-the-mill telepic that deals with the same issues  as this film is no better than such productions. Although the ideas and issues are easy to relate to  the same stuff has been explored in many other films  many times before  and the fashion that they are presented in here is very hackneyed. The characters are never better than ordinary  and they are even a tad annoying to have on screen. There is also a severe under-development of Joan Allen's character  as we see her angry  but we do not see her before she changes  and therefore there is no contrast: no visible change. Allen has received a lot of praise for being so angry and stressed  but she is never not - so she is just playing one emotional type - and I cannot call that a good performance myself. The rest of the cast deliver reasonably well  but there are no great performances. I really cannot call this a very good film  but if it could have brought something new in  then I feel the film could have risen above the mark.\tRarely do I like the post-modern device of telegraphing the ending of a film at the beginning. It usually reeks of pretension  as if the filmmaker is saying  \My film is so important  it doesn't need trivialities like suspense.\"" But done thoughtfully  the technique can build tension and draw in the viewer rather than alienate. This is the Case in The Upside of Anger  which leads off with a scene with the main characters on their way to a funeral. Director Mike Binder uses this to advantage  however  so that each scene is imbued with tension it otherwise would have lacked. Of course the ending will be the hook that draws most into conversation about this film. Is it manipulative? Does it fit? I argue not only does it fit  it gives you two films in one; the one you just saw and the one which you will replay in your mind given the ending. The film is not without flaws. In family films  as with actual families  sometimes one child is given less attention. In Upside  it's Keri Russell's character who almost seems to be from a different family altogether. This may be Binder's point  but by not amalgamating characters  he is forced to balance too many story lines  neglecting more interesting relationships. For example  Binder's character  \""Shep \"" is a gem in this picture and really has a unique point of view. The film seemed to be begging for a final scene between \""Shep\"" and Joan Allen's character. The score is also weak  relying on clich\u00e9d cues to tell us whether a scene is comic or dramatic. The strength of this picture is that it defies labels \u0097 it is a drama with comic moments \u0097 and the music belies this. In any case  every single actor is exceptional \u0097 especially Costner and Allen's. Every time Costner seems to have slipped into parody  he delivers one of these sublime performances that remind you why he's a screen idol. And if Allen isn't nominated for awards aplenty for her work here  I suppose that would be the downside to The Upside of Anger.\tThis was a very surprising movie. The entire plot was solely character driven and very well structured. Each aspect of the main characters reflect a believable emotional role in a family; how a mother's reaction to a traumatic event shapes the behaviours of the daughters and boyfriend. The character progression is structured in that the consequences are numerous and unique to an individual but remain logical. You could watch the movie 50 times and still be able to point out parallels  both in the individual plots of the stars as well as visual cues. The cinematography is seamless and compliments the emotion of the scene and cinematic progression of the movie. Pleasantly and surprisingly funny at times  the humour is quality; good comedy  and not just for a drama. Also heartfelt throughout  the lives that this film chronicles leaves me believing that this may have happened and I can empathise wholly. In addition to being well structured  the coda of the movie is unpredictable  ending on a happy note; though its arrival was a surprise. It remains me of \""American Beauty\""  though the latter I find to be superior; it is truth about the presentation of a family's emotional state.\tThe upside of Anger is a movie with a lot to say about many things  in addition to anger. So many movies today have nothing to say...and become so easy to forget. This one was memorable. The movie spoke of relationships  emotion  perseverance  humor  tolerance  and of course anger. This movie was a near masterpiece  really. The performances were terrific by all the females  especially Joan Allen. The script was terrific and the directing was top notch too. Kudos to Mike Binder!!All people have shitty things happen to them...that's a fact. The lesson in the movie is that the important thing is  how do we deal with those shitty things. We can choose alcohol  we can choose anger  we can choose to hurt those we love. But eventually  we will chose happiness  despite all the mayhem life throws our way. Happiness is a relative term. I loved the fact that there were many things about Terry (Joan Allen) that I didn't like  yet  I still liked her enough to be sympathetic towards her. I don't cry that easily during movies  but this one brought the Kleenex out  twice. I am a guy and I am aware that tears are very therapeutic. A good cry is awesome..if it's real. Many things have been said about the ending  but watch it for yourself. I have no problems at all with the ending. See this movie  I dare you not to like it.\tIf you are a man and were not offended by this movie you are probably gay.Everything wrong with women's attitudes towards father's and men are showcased in the two hours this movie plays. Let me explain.Husband of 30 years goes missing. Wife assumes he's a cad. Doesn't report him missing. Doesn't call police. Doesn't even call his office. Has an affair with the next door neighbor. Poisons his children into believing her horribly wrong assumption. Destroys his reputation by telling everyone she knows what she wants people to believe he did to her.She is so self-centered she doesn't even know if her husband exists. She slaps her daughters boyfriend because her trust issues run so deep she has uncontrolled violence towards men. The man didn't strike back  which was a joke.The romance with the neighbor is a joke. The woman is so vile  no self-respecting man would go near her. She offers absolutely nothing. She disrespects every male within hearing distant.She is a contradiction. She wants her children to go to college but doesn't bother asking them. She is so self-centered  she couldn't possibly care about her children.The worst moment in the film was when she lead her children to announce they hate their father. And worse yet  the kids (all girls) readily accepts this garbage. I guess father's rank right up there with dog poo.The second worst moment in the film was after the funeral the witch and her brood are sitting at a picnic table with the witch's boyfriend  and they start laughing and smiling all gay and happy  confirming the father was indeed dog poo. Yes folks. Not a tear in site for dear old dad  who died and was forgotten quicker than they could get our of the funeral attire.The men are dog poo  the women are self-centered  self-righteous  witches  and the children are dumb as logs.So if that sounds interesting to you  then watch the movie. It pretty much ruined my day and makes me wonder if my wife and children actually care about me. Jaws was much better. At least all I have to do to avoid getting eaten is stay out of the water. How do I avoid gender discrimination and bias?\tThe Upside Of Anger  is about Terry Wolfmeyer  who is a bitter and miserable woman after her husband just recently left her. She is stuck at home raising her four daughters Andy  Lavender (nicknamed Popeye)  Emily and Hadley. Terry's neighbour across the street is Denny Davies  a retired baseball player who now has his own radio show. Denny  likes Terry  and will constantly invite himself over and try to be in her life and the girls. Through all this he gets Andy  a job at his radio show. Lavender  is starting to get interested in boys and meets one she thinks that she likes  Emily wants to be a dancer but may be working herself too hard in the process and Hadley  and Terry  never really had a great relationship and a little while after Hadley  returns from college she meets her boyfriend that she will soon be marrying. Through good times and bad Denny always seems to be there for Terry  and as bitter and nasty as she can sometimes be she starts to like Denny  as well. The Upside Of Anger  has good direction  a good script  good performances by the whole cast (especially Kevin Costner (who plays Denny)  Joan Allen (who plays Terry) and Erika Christensen  Evan Rachel Wood  Keri Russell and Alicia Witt  who play Terry's daughters)  good original music  good cinematography and good film editing. The film has interesting characters and despite their flaws they are likable characters and we start to care about them and want to see what will happen to them by the end of the movie and if things will work out for them or not. The film is sharp  has some good dialog  has good character development  is engrossing and the film works well to blend both comedy and drama together and with the good writing and strong cast it pulls it off. I would have perhaps maybe liked to have known a little bit more of the daughters but the film still was a nice light film and I enjoyed it.\tI've always admired Kevin Costner's laconic screen presence  in BULL DURHAM  TIN CUP  even DANCES WITH WOLVES  JFK and PERFECT WORLD. Now no longer leading-man handsome  he's developed into a first- rate character actor  and as a washed-up  alcoholic ex-baseball player-turned radio talk-show host  Costner offers company and comfort to Joan Allen as a drinking buddy in the bittersweet THE UPSIDE OF ANGER. Mike Binder's superb film about an abandoned wife of four teenage girls should qualify as one of this year's best films. But because it was released so early  did only respectable business  and isn't a vehicle for an over-hyped box-office attraction on magazine covers now  it will probably only get the respect of word-of-mouth. I saw this engrossing  deeply wonderful film when it opened last winter  and made up my mind that I would have to have the DVD as soon as it became available. Joan Allen  as Terry Wolfmeyer dazzles us in a performance that is both comically and dramatically masterful as the drunken mother seemingly at war with her four beautiful daughters. Terry's rage over her husband's abandonment of her and their children  is a mean-spirited rebuke to her daughters  who try with great patience to survive their mother's theatrical bitterness. But mama has given them the gift of her humor  and I think it's what saves these girls. There's a look that Joan Allen gives when one of her daughters is doing exactly what she doesn't want them to be doing. What it is they are doing to upset their mother is always in doubt because she's never really making rational sense. She's only filtering her displeasure through the rheumy eyes of her last cocktail. There's a scene at the family dining room where Hadley  her eldest daughter (the ever fascinating Alica Witt  who should be starring in her own movies)  announces she's pregnant with her second baby. Allen was none-to-happy that her daughter opted for marriage and motherhood over a career  and her beady- eyed stare at her daughter's latest announcement of her grand-motherhood is a comic masterpiece. But when Allen finally can no longer avoid facing her crippling anger  Allen breaks your heart. Having never had an outlet for her comic abilities  she's surprises you with her skill. That she walks this fine tightrope between both extremes says much for her talent as an actor. Finally back to Costner. Denny Davies might have been a dangerous character for Costner to revisit. Afterall  he's played washed up or played out sports characters before. His career has suffered a very precipitous fall following the media-created debacle of his so-called grandiose ego in WATERWORLD  and the opportunities have been few and far between since then. But Denny is a rich character any actor would love to sink their teeth into  and Costner embraces Denny's humanity with consummate ease. Discovering his neighbor has been abandoned by her husband  Denny offers to keep her company while they drink. They warily circle each other during these boozy afternoons of watching television  drinking and not saying much to each other. And when that changes  you see the transition from friend to lover mainly through the eyes of Denny. When she first proposes they sleep together  it's Denny who chickens out at the last minute. But as their relationship develops  you see Denny reach out to Terry's girls in a way that is sympathetic but also gives them room to accept and then love him in return. This is a terribly important test for Denny. So when the youngest of the girls finally asks him if he plans to marry Terry  Denny comes to understand that the girls have welcomed him into the family. Costner is sensational in this film  but he keeps it all so low-key  always keeping the focus on Allen's character  and he ends up giving her the film--and rightfully so  I think. This is a gift to Allen. Costner recognizes this  and I think the movie is all the better for his act of generosity. This is a performance that people will talk about for years to come. Like Jeff Bridges and Dennis Quaid  Costner is one of our best screen actors  and it's great to see him in a role that is truly worthy of his fine talent. Each of the daughter's is skillfully rendered by Erka Christensen  Evan Rachel Wood  Keri Russel and Alicia Witt. These young women look and act like siblings. Auteur Mike Binder has given himself a role as Denny's radio producer  who is romancing one of the daughters  much to her mother's disgust. He's funny  pathetic  and just a bit creepy as a Romeo with romantic ideas way above his station!Binder's fine script gives this ensemble film the ballast that keeps you laughing and crying. He's found the emotional core in these character's lives  and the pace of the film  which clocks in at just under two hours  provides a sense of completeness. Ultimately it is Costner's generosity as an actor that so disarms the viewer. In every shot  Joan Allen's Terry is the riveting center  with Costner playing to her every moment without stealing attention away from her. That earns my whole- hearted respect. THE UPSIDE OF ANGER should be seen and savored by anyone who cares deeply about moves with something to say about the human condition. Binder's adroit direction makes this a film to set beside TERMS OF ENDEARMENT  AS GOOD AS IT GETS  and Lasse Hallstrom's vastly underrated SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT. Finally it's such a pleasure to see two pros such as Allen and Costner hit it right out of the park!\tThe Upside of Anger contains some of the career highlights of many actors  including Joan Allen and Kevin Costner. Joan Allen plays a woman with four daughters whose husband has left her. Costner is Allen's next door neighbor who falls in love with her. the movie covers the relationship with them and the relationships of the four daughters who are very well cast. The Upside of Anger is about learning to live again after changes in life. Director Mike Bender does a really good job of writing and directing this film. The film's only flaw is Bender's own character in the movie as Costner's producer on the radio. He comes across as someone who we can't entirely love or hate. He is supposed to be a sleazy guy because he dates younger women and dates one of Allen's daughters  but since the character seems sincere in his affections for her  I couldn't get myself to completely hate him. He dates younger women  so what? The attitude the other characters have toward this character actually upsets the balance of the movie  which is supposed to be about how anger is self destructive in the long term. Maybe the character was ill used or should have been cut from the film entirely. Otherwise  this movie is worth a rental and maybe better than some other films that have been out recently. 7/10\tI loved this movie. I recommend buying the DVD (which has several uncut scenes and a good bit of background on the film) This is such a cool story and has a great message about letting anger get you to misjudge your life and your world. It has a quality that makes it almost feel like a novel. I will be one of the first in line for Mike Binder's next films. He is my new favorite director/writer/actor. I thought all of his characters and actors were perfectly portrayed. Everyone here has said how great Joan Allen is but I am going to say that Erica Christenen and Kerry Russell were the two best things in the movie..(next to Kevin Costner) This is funny and warm and real and a great film. It's cool that people still make movies like this. Hats off to Mike Binder and the producers of this movie. (New Line?) Buy or rent the DVD if you missed it in theaters. You won't be dissatisfied.\tI saw this movie just the other day and I was very pleased with it. I liked the way all the characters in he movie had a little of something going on with them then just focusing one just one or two main story lines. However  I think Kevin Cosnter reprises his role of \""Crash Davis\"" from Bull Durham. There are far too many things going on to make you believe as I did that it just might be him. The jacket  the talk  the way he seems to be smarter then what we are to think  his baseball background and all the drinking. If it's not him  then it very well could be. either way  the movie was very good and I would see it again  So grab a blanket and that special someone or not and watch a movie thats worth watching.\tJoan Allen is in superb form here  abandoned by her husband  angry  and left to deal with four teenage girls \u0096 although they deal with her just as much.It's a little long \u0096 all her girls go through various troubles \u0096 but her relationship with Kevin Costner (a retired alcoholic baseball player) is fascinating  as both characters are flawed and intriguing. The acting is brilliant...Allen could be up for an Oscar nomination she's so good  and this is Costner's best performance since 'A Perfect World'.Writer/director Mike Binder's movie is populated by real and flawed people. It's an honest look how anger can effect people; admittedly  he needs someone to edit his own performances a bit  and there are plot holes  but this is still a good movie.\t\""The Upside of Anger\"" is all about a laid back retired baseball hero (Cosner) who becomes involved with a neighbor woman (Allen) who has a perpetual bad attitude because her husband has run off to Sweden with his secretary. The film is sweetened by the woman's four beautiful but disparate daughters who thicken the plot with their own growing pains and family semifunctionality. Though it's been a long road from Mike Binder's debut in the raunchy romp \""Hollywood Knights\"" (one of my guilty pleasures which helped launch the careers of Michelle Pffiefer  Tony Danza  Roberft Whurl  Fran Drescher and others)  he score's a hit as director  writer  and character actor with this enjoyable and insightful cross-genre (comedy/drama/romance) tale of a mature couple sorting through their midlife crises together. Not a blockbuster but a very pleasant little film with a twist at the end worthy of a DVD rental. (B)\tA touching human dramedy starring Joan Allen as a woman whose husband leaves her suddenly. She has four daughters ranging from 15 to their early 20s  and in her emotional state she has real trouble dealing with them. Allen's loneliness \u0096 and alcoholism \u0096 attract a neighbor  played by Kevin Costner  a former baseball player who hosts a radio show but doesn't do much else. I think the film does really well most of the time  keeping away from clich\u00e9s. It doesn't necessarily want us to sympathize completely with Allen's character. She's very often self-involved. I actually even hated her character on occasion. I never blamed the daughters when they acted against her  which they do often enough. And I love the sweet relationship that develops between Allen and Costner. I think the film makes several big mistakes. I don't like the wraparound sequence  which shows a handful of the characters traveling to a funeral. Later on  the script teases us with whose funeral it is  and it's distracting. There is also an annoying voice-over  provided by the youngest daughter (played by Thirteen's Evan Rachel Wood)  that is completely unnecessary. How beautiful would it have been without that opening bit  and to have the film end with that sublime little scene at the picnic table  wordless? There is also a handful of scenes that are too over-the-top  most notably the one where Costner kicks in the bathroom door and the one where Wood's guy friend smashes through the window (his character was complete during his previous sequence  where his father belittles him and Costner defends him). And I think the one place where it went for the obvious and shouldn't. The director has a role for himself where he plays this scummy-looking guy in his mid-40s who starts dating Allen's 18 year-old daughter. But then there are some scenes later on where he seems to genuinely care for the girl. I liked that it went somewhere new with this  but then it reverts near the end  saying  oh  wait  he really was just a pervert. Sorry to subvert your expectations  audience! Small problems aside  this is very much worthwhile and one of the better films of 2005 so far.\tAlthough at times a little melodramatic  and probably more of a drama than comedy - this movie succeeds with good character development and interaction. One of the better qualities of the film is that scenes with multiple actors work as well as scenes with one-on-one's. With strong leads from Allen and Costner and a quirky and at times insightful script  the movie has good pacing and pep. Didn't know the director was one of the main supporting cast  but he brings sort of a Ben Stiller-esquire persona without the slapstick or crudeness in support. The wedding scene with he and Allen was one of the better scenes in the movie  with character dialog cutting right into social stigmas of age.Joan Allen really stands out in her misery  bluntness  and sometimes tactless behavior with her daughters. And the shared problems of middle-age and loneliness  often clich\u00e9d  are done with some sly humor - there is some cynicism here from the mom that is nicely balanced with adolescent antics of the Costner character - the bathroom scenes with Costner/Allen are a well written evolution  indicative of character growth. The growth of their relationship is entertaining and believable with some minor exceptions (like Costner kicking the door in).The younger actresses give OK support - the more interesting being the younger 2  while the older 2 seem a little less dynamic in their roles  but not bad.This is a recommended rental for anyone looking for a quirky sometimes insightful drama with a focus on great character interaction more than plot or story. Pretty good.\tI knew nothing of this movie before renting it from our local video store. Being a Costner fan  I thought I'd give it a try. What a waste of film! Thank God I bought pop corn or it would have been a total waste of my time. This movie should be accompanied by a disclaimer that suggests \""If you're a male of average intelligence  you might consider channel surfing for a sporting event happening somewhere in the world because this is a chick flick and it sucks.\"" This was absolutely the worst film I've seen since Hugh Grant in that ultimate piece of crap  Notting Hill (currently available at Amazon for just $9.09 - does that tell you something?). Talk about slow to develop. I was able to slip out of the room  catch three innings of the Yankee game  grab a cold one  pop my pop corn and return to the movie and not miss a thing!. I'd sooner put pins in my eyes before I watched this piece of garbage again. Kevin  you did Field of Dreams! What's up with this?How this film could garner comments like:a daring alloy of pungent misery and jaw-dropping anticsHey author  - wake up  put some guys underwear on  get a life  have a beer  watch a game or something. The only time my jaw dropped during this piece of s  was when I asked myself why the f I rented it to begin with. You're right about the misery part though  that's how I'd characterize the 120 minutes of my life wasted on this juggernaut. Kevin  please come back to us!\tI had to wince and look away this movie was so bad.The movie was obviously written by those low class types who think anguish  bad manners  bad table manners  smoking  drinking  being drunk and stupid and acting like an ass constantly is the height of good writing and \""meaning\"".Watching these actors sucking on cigarettes to facilitate the smoking industry's slick and successful attempt to keep people hooked on cancer sticks is disgusting; and drunks falling all over themselves  whining and crying while living in huge mansions and living large is pathetic.Whine whine whine. Who cares? Then watching them shovel food into gaping mouths at the table  stuffing their drunken faces with forks in their left hand in the typical low class manner in most east coast movies makes you want to never eat popcorn at a movie again with transference endemic to such bad manners.And then the scene where the selfish  self-centered drunks hold up all of traffic with their two cars blocking everyone  while they just sat and talked! I would have gotten out and kicked both their drunken asses. Then she speeds through a neighborhood in her drunken state  waving at the old guy who keeps telling her to slow down because there are children playing. Right  individual rights to drive drunk with children around. The liberal pampered self is indulged....no time outs for adults  just movies about them.Absolutely horrible movie. If you think Jeff Goldbloom and Woody Alan and that cabal of neurotic masturbatory-pre-occupied  sexually obsessed guilt-ridden self-centered wussie boys who wear funny little caps to their temple a movie for you.Mapi\tThis movie has no redeeming value at all. First off the acting was Mc Crappy i don't care what you say they completely bombed that portion. Any woman could do what she did in that film  which consisted of drinking and going rants saying \""no one listens to me\"". OK wait where was the plot..oh yea there wasn't one. Oh and don't you love how Denny boy just randomly fell in love with her. For a movie with no plot you at least need character development. The ending completely buried the film in its own stupidity and then went on to crap on its headstone. Don't waste your life  this was an embarrassment to the independent film world.\tWhat a difference a day makes  just like in real life. This film covers a lot of emotional territory and does it better than I've seen in a very long time. And we see a lot of days that make a big difference. My hat's off to Mike Binder for writing a story that is full of vastly different  interesting  but true characters that somehow find a comfort zone with each other and for having them speak words the rest of us might only think. Joan Allen is amazing in the role of a woman caught in an intersection of life and not knowing which way to turn. She is angry  hurt  and doesn't really want to think about tomorrow. Allen could easily take to her bed but she has four daughters who each are on the brink of their own awakenings and the mix of their lives as a partial outlet for her anger keep her from going over the edge into the abyss of screaming meemies. We are informed that Allen's character was always so sweet until the current crisis  and that makes her ravings and temporarily-rude behavior believable and acceptable. We can surmise that her previously sweet personality and the sense of humor we glimpse from time to time are among the reasons she has such loving daughters now when she needs them. Allen's range of comedic and dramatic skills are like the facets of a diamond in this performance.Kevin Costner has finally become a genuine actor in his role as a - yes  again - baseball player  though now retired. I've never been a big fan of his  but this movie made one of me. His is a complex portrait of aging male-ness. His acceptance of his lot in life  his honesty  and his desire to hold onto his integrity are all captured in the relaxed but confident way he meshes with Allen's family. A lot of reviews describe his character as an alcoholic  but I strongly disagree. He likes to cocktail to take the edge off  but he is never disgustingly drunk and there are many scenes showing him sober  rational  and not presenting drastic personality changes. His character is actually the man all single women over 40 are looking for and can never find: playful  assured  good looking in a mature way  boyish in other ways  financially secure with an interesting past  cognizant of the meaningful things in life  and not skirt-chasing 20 year olds. I wonder if Binder knows such a guy because he drew him with such sincerity. When Costner says a big chunk of his life is yet to come  that's what a home run 'sounds' like. I've never seen Costner so much in-the-skin of a role. It doesn't look like he's acting which is what acting is all about  isn't it? Mike Binder took a chance casting himself in the role of the sleazy producer  but he's simply terrific. I believe he thought he knew best how to play this role because he wanted just the right amount of sleaze without too much ego and he nailed it. In most movies  his character would be the one we love to hate because it would have been written with a harder edge  but not here. I had sympathy for him because you could see the \""search for self-esteem\"" and his total lack of awareness about how to actually achieve it written all over him.The dialogue and the characters are intelligent and swept me into their world and though the financially affluent environment at first did not ring true  it ultimately was a relief not to have the lack of money thrown in as another driver for the story. A lot of movies in this genre tend to get hysterical by including every darn stinking piece of bad luck imaginable. In this story there is just enough going on and rich people  by the way"
The Village (2004),"I'm so glad I didn't waste money seeing this in the theaters and waited until it came to satellite. I can't think of a much worse way to spend $7.50 then to see this silly little movie.First  let me say that I did enjoy the Sixth Sense  Unbreakable  and Signs immensely. They all were moving  well done films that knew how to keep your suspense heightened. Suspenseful films are some of my favorite films to watch and Shyamalan is normally a master at it.The \suspense\"" in this film revolves around eerie creatures in woods outside a nineteenth century village. The people in the village fear the creatures but are safe as long as they don't venture out into the woods. Of course  you know some of the villagers  being naturally curious  will eventually wander out in the woods. So the creatures do some things to make sure the villagers don't do it again. Are there some hidden meanings and secrets involved with the creatures and the villagers? Of course there are...after all  it's a Shyamalan movie.But there is no reason for me to even discuss the \""secrets\"" involved with the creatures  the village  or any other part of this movie  because they are just so unbelievably silly. Let's just say that some secrets are not worth $7.50 nor an hour and a half of your life to find out. The difference with the other 3 Shyamalan movies I mentioned above is that the secrets involved with them were at least somewhat believable and so did not ruin the stories.I really hope Shyamalan learns from this meager effort and puts a little more thought into his next movie.\tM. Night Shyamalan has made some of my favorite movies: The Sixth Sense  Unbreakable and Signs. Now he has written another movie that has what is now known as the \""twist ending \"" something he is becoming synonymous with in The Village. I wouldn't dare give away the quick turn to the left the movie takes  but I will say  it disappoints to a degree. It is not a ridiculous ending  but what could have been if Shyamalan had trusted his original premise of a 1890s Pennsylvania countryside village terrorized by creatures who patrol the surrounding woods. We get the usual eerie mood that Shyamalan has given us before. The Village excels in the isolating feeling that we got in Signs. I might be the only person to admit to liking Signs  but I appreciated the humanized battle between one family and invading aliens. Here in The Village  we have one town  cutoff from the rest of society trying to battle a race of creatures who limits their abilities to even treat their sick and injured. The pace of the movie is slow and moody  especially through the orange tint and effective soundtrack. The village is lead by a counsel of elders  including Edward Walker (William Hurt) who is father to two daughters  including the blind Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard). Ivy has a childhood fling with the local mentally challenged man Noah (Adrian Brody) but ends up falling in love with Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix)  who is the first to suggest leaving the village to gain medical supplies. After Noah causes harm to Lucius  Ivy decides she's the one to go out into the woods and find medical help. This is where the movie goes from moody mythical theater to that movie with a \""twist\"" ending. I wanted more  dammit. I don't think I'm the only one. I was intrigued by the creatures  and I didn't like how Shymalan dealt with them. Sure  there is a certain amount of interest and logic to how the movie played out  but it could have been more. I didn't hate this movie  but I kind of hated how it ended. Mr. Shyamalan  for your next movie  perhaps the best \""twist\"" is no twist at all.\tMuch better than \""Signs\""...a little better than \""Unbreakable\""...but not as good as \""Sixth Sense\""...Dunst would've done an admirable job in the new girl's role  but Dallas gives an excellent performance...her only apparent problem was a minor technical one  and only early in the film--making her eyes seem sightless by being \""unfocused\""...she seemed to be looking straight at people in the early going  but by the time Phoenix' character was attacked  she had it licked...Shyalaman once again does a great job of leading you to make certain assumptions and take certain things for granted...a little more development on the elder's \""lives\"" before they settled the village might've added a bit more contrast and \""twist\"" to the storyline  but the revelation itself essentially provides contrast enough...the only thing seemingly overdone...and it seemed as if it were a last minute rewrite...was the supposed \""buyoff\"" of the FAA to disallow overhead flights...again  the realization of what the \""village\"" really was had clearly been established...additional explanation seemed a little contrived to me...Phoenix' role was supposedly written for him; I had read where Johnny Depp was offered the role but backed out when he learned of Shyalaman's quirkiness (THAT certainly seems a bit like the pot calling the kettle black)...either way  Phoenix makes the role his...Hurt is excellent as the village leader  and Weaver is startlingly authentic as a very plain appearing 18th century puritan...a major role departure for her in every sense...Let's hope M. Night continues in this genre...Hitchcock has nothing to be worried about yet...but Shyalaman appears back on the right track after the train wreck that was \""Signs\""...oh  wait...that was \""Unbreakable\""  wasn't it???\tI've seen this movie and I was totally surprised not because I found a very good movie but because I found it has nothing to do with what I expected or may be to what all of us expected! I think that we all expected a horror movie or may be a thriller and that's from the trailer and the quote of the movie and everything else but what I really found was a drama! And a very good one too! The story is a very good one discussing a very interesting topic too  the idea that this is the current time and those people chose not to live in that world because of it's cruelty and chose to hide away in a natural preserve and make a myth about unknown creatures so that no one goes into the woods and so that they be kept safe from today's world.I think that it's a very good movie and it's totally underrated even by me!!!!\tWhen I rented the movie I was expecting a horror movie and I was wrong. It was high drama  intense  a thriller  a beautiful love story  a story about life and about change. Visually it was beautiful - some images were like a piece of art. I particularly liked the images of the sisters sweeping and dancing on the porch. The music was incredible. I kept playing credits over and over just to hear the music. I then went out and bought the soundtrack. The acting was like more of a stage play then an everyday movie. There was an unexpected twist and the end of the movie that really made it extra special. I would highly recommend this movie.\tNormally  I'm impressed with Shyamaln's work. Unbreakable was good and Signs was good. Sixth Sense was pretty good too. But The Village just turned out to be a piece of crap. I mean  come on! How can you have a trailer that good and have something that sucked so bad? For an M. Night Shyamalan film  this was disappointing.On a brighter note  the plot was creepy and when someone entered the woods  the sound effects and whatnot were very scary. And when you only see that little bit of the monsters  they were also scary. However  when you see the full Monte of them  they look like something taken from Power Rangers. I half expected them to grow gigantic and shoot eye beams at the village. And while the plot was creepy  it was overall weak and in some cases pointless. All in all: not impressive. 4 outta 10.\t\""The Village\"" is a perfect example of why it's dangerous to mis-market a movie. While being handled like a thriller  the audience would have been much better informed about what it actually is if it were handled more as a human interest piece. \""The Village\"" becomes much more interesting when watching it as a character study than a horror/suspense movie.Changing focus on a movie can only take you so far  though. There's still the matter of the plot - does it work? The answer is yes and no. It works when you consider the movie a warning against being ruled by fear - I once heard that M. Night Shyamalan (henceforth MNS) had post 9/11 America in mind when writing the film. In that light  one sees the villagers purposely using fear as a control mechanism and the movie becomes a fairly clever commentary on our times. It doesn't work when you question the plot to much. It's not easy to try to make sense of the choices and actions of the Elders. Superficial answers are all one can get. The final confrontation with a \""creature\"" at the end doesn't quite work out as well as it should. For a movie that works best on a psychological level  the action involved seems misplaced. I tend to see it as a built in bathroom break and usually don't watch it through.The actor's portrayals of their characters are hit and miss. I don't know if it was a purposeful choice of MNS  but portrayal of the Elders don't ring as true as the younger generation. Given the final twists of the movie  maybe the Elders were meant to sound rather clunky with their speech. Regardless  the work of the older generation (with a special mention of William Hurt) largely comes off as rather wooden and uncomfortable. The acting improves greatly with the younger stars. It is mostly the work of the perfectly cast Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix that make the movie bearable at all  although smaller roles such as Judy Greer's and Michael Pitt's definitely add to the film. In my experience  it's general consensus that Bryce and Joaquin's scenes together that are the best in the film.Overall  I think MNS's greatest achievement in this movie is in creating atmosphere and a visually appealing directing style. I think it's time he starts working on scripts with other people - he needs someone to tell him when something doesn't work.\tThis is the one movie out of about 20 that I have commented on that I'm really not what to say about. The idea of the movie (once you've seen the end) is so unrealistic but interesting. It obviously could never happen  and being that it's not a star wars movie  it just doesn't quite work. I'm sure that someone else other than the blind girl would've wondered out of the woods eventually and realized that it was not the 19th century (other than the town council  or whatever they were called). One satisfying scene is seeing the one actor fall to his death in the woods. I do feel badly that he portrays a mentally handicapped individual in the movie  I just don't like him in real life (he was in \""The Jacket\"". What the heck is his name?). Oh well  I'm sure I'll think of it later. Anyway  this movie is alright  but a bit disappointing. Oh yeah  It's Adrian Brody!!\tI never watch trailers anymore cause it ruined Four Weddings And A Funeral for me way back...;-)I actually close my eyes and put my fingers into my ears whenever there's \""Trailer-Alert\"" - except the ones I know I won't go and see anyway...So  after Signs I was a bit out of Night...though I loved Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.I would never even consider his films \""horror\"" or \""frightening\"" in any way - but that goes for all of Stephen King for me as well....it's just about life  experiences and how people react in - okay  VERY unusual  but metaphorical - situations....So  I didn't see The Village till I was at the DVD rental and the guy behind the counter said \""You have two  you can take one more for the price of two\""...so I remembered - ah  yes  I wanted to see that  Joaquin Phoenix is in it again  hope it's not too much like Signs or too moody and boring ...I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED !!!It gripped me from the first shot  first lines... Come ON  we are all grown ups here  I can't be scared by creatures in the woods...;-)))I watched fantastic actors playing low-key and true to life  speaking lines like from an Dickens' novel (though much deeper at times)  every single one so intense  so real - it was just amazing ! What a fantastic ride that was ! What a sweet love story  that lives on glances (one-way of course...;-)) and held-back moves  yet full-frontal in your face as the motivator for the quest. Bryce Dallas Howard is pure genius ! I love every actor in this movie  and I mean every single one !This is a movie for people who like a good story (any kind of story  but yes  this here contains a \""love\""-one..)  true-to-life performances  a great but unobtrusive soundtrack.Watched it again right after. Will buy the DVD. Glad to see from the reviews that I am not alone in my opinion..!!\tMaybe I've seen too many movies like this. I'd worked out what the catch would be very early on and watching the rest of the movie was simply a case of proving I was right and adding some details.That said  the movie works rather well. Though nothing very much actually happens (until the last 20 minutes or so)  the film sustains a pleasurably uncomfortable level of tension for most of its length. In this  it is helped by a splendid performance from Bryce Dallas Howard. The supporting cast  containing such worthies as Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt  is also excellent. Only Joaquin Phoenix seems strangely disengaged; however  his character barely appears in the last portion of the film  so this doesn't spoil things too much.The photography was OK and I enjoyed listening to the dialog  framed as it was in the English of the late 19th century. The music  however  was sometimes intrusive; there are times in all movies when music just isn't necessary  a fact the film makers here seemed not to realize.One to watch nonetheless. Something of a leap of faith is required  but it's worth the trouble.Rating: 7/10.\tWHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?! Why the hell I can't always give a movie it's deserved score?? There's nothing good in this movie. The story is awful  the main actress is really terrible  and it's so boring. I saw the beginning and understood it's about a blind girl who wants to get out of the forest and go to the city. After 30 minutes of watching I fell asleep (It was in the cinema) and woke up in the 20-40 last minutes of the movie  and nothing happened  the girl didn't arrive to the city and one of them died. This piece of s**t is in general a one big 0  so why i can't give a 0 star movie 0. BTW: M. Night Shyamalan  you should thank me for giving your movie 10% more than what it deserves.\tM. Night Shyamalan is one of our most creative and singular directors  recalling the styles of many of the European film auteurs. In \""The Sixth Sense\"" and \""Unbreakable \"" there were fascinating locales within the urban confines of Philadelphia. In \""The Sign\"" and \""The Village \"" the uniquely sinister mood is evoked in rural Pennsylvania.In \""The Village \"" Shyamalan develops a story around the daily life of a strict commune\u0097virtually a cult\u0097living in a small community in rural Pennsylvania in the nineteenth century. It is a hothouse environment with people held together with a bond of fear due to the mysterious appearances of supernatural creatures. The casting of the film was outstanding with Joaquin Phoenix  Adrien Brody  William Hurt  and Sigourney Weaver as major figures within the community. Above all  it is the performance of Bryce Dallas Howard who delivers the emotional impact of the drama as a young blind woman named Ivy  who is forced to make an arduous journey for essential medicines for her fianc\u00e9. The mysteries and indeed the secrets of the community unfold along with Ivy's odyssey.In the undercurrent of violence which ran through the film  \""The Village\"" recalls the famous and disturbing 1955 novel of William Golding  \""The Lord of the Flies.\"" In Golding's story  a group of boys isolated on an island discover the hidden  violent impulses lurking from within when forced to function on their own in a community. In the rural Pennsylvania of \""The Village \"" the story of commune is nearly identical to the world of \""The Lord of the Flies.\"" The so-called elders of the community seek to promote a peaceful existence. But like a self-fulfilling prophecy  the violence will emerge and potentially tear the village asunder.\tThe plot was slow and mediocre on a good day (see: Signs). This is the usual Liberal Mantra of We Know Better Than You. Any of the feeble characters involved in this dogma could have joined a commune or Amish settlement. Instead they remove any choice their offspring might of had. Why? Mindlessly doing as your told is the corner stone of the ACLU  dictators and liberals. As long is it is what they tell you. I was terribly disappointed in Weaver doing this movie. After \""Death and the Maiden (1994)\""  a terrific drama and \""Galaxy Quest (1999)\""  an amazing comedy and spoof of Sci-Fi  to lower herself to drivel like this  Shame  Shame  Shame. Well even the best can have a bad day. Lets all hope for no more as bad as this one was. Not surprised to see Holden. My only regrets about this movie is the two hours of my life I will never get back  the $1.50 I spent to see it at the theater and that IMDb reviews do not go to zero or lower.\tIt must be tough being director M. Night Shyamalan. He has built a career off of movies with unexpected turns  and I imagine with each movie it must get harder to come up with something. So while The Village only has two real twists  one of which is surprising but no more so than many other movies by more obscure filmmakers and the other of which I fully expected from the beginning of the film  I have to be fair and say  well  you can't get those great twists every time.The problem with the movie isn't the lack of twists but the fact that it's just rather dull. The stilted speaking style is sort of interesting but also a bit annoying and the story never grabs me. Judy Greer and Adrien Brody are both quite good and there are a couple of effective scenes of suspense  but for the most part the movie is so measured as to feel static.I think much of the problem is Shyamalan uses his twists to make the audience forgive him for any film-making faults. Signs wasn't a great movie  and without the surprising finale I would have walked away disappointed  but because it had a strong pay off it made everything alright. If Shyamalan has run out of clever twists then he is going to have to work on making his movies pay off not with a stunning denouement but with engaging and engrossing film making throughout. Hopefully he'll learn to do that  and won't even need the clever tricks that have endeared him to me.\twhat I don't get is if Ivy finds out that the story of \"" Those who we do not speak of\"" is a lie then why does she get so terrified when that mental dude comes and tries to scare her? I mean she's blind in the first place so how does she even know that he's dressed up like that? She didn't even make contact with him  what if it was just a human  after all the footsteps should have sounded like human ones.Also  I thought that the ending was really lame like  so she went out to get medicine and came back. So what. Is she gonna continue living in a village full of lies? It's just back to the beginning isn't it? I mean now she knows about the lie but nothing changed in the movie. Is she gonna tell everyone? Are they gonna get discovered? Like what was the point of the movie. IMO it was a complete waste of time.\tI'm glad I didn't pay to see this after watching it. I really liked Night's other 3 films  esp. Signs  which I thought was great. But this was dull  too easy to figure out  and not tense or scary. Also the funny lines were missing that were in Signs. This movie moves at too slow a pace. The film is about a village in a remote place where the elders tell everyone not to go beyond the borders because creatures live in the woods. It centers around 3 people: a blind girl Ivy  the guy she likes Lucius  and a mentally retarded man  Noah  who likes Ivy. Events happen that lead Ivy to want to venture to other towns in search of medicines. So even before she leaves  the \""big secret\"" is revealed. So half the movie  we already know the plot twist  which makes it much less tense and exciting. And the demise of Noah isn't thrilling either.FINAL VERDICT: I never thought I'd dis a Knight film  but I don't recommend this one. The plot and mystery just don't hold up to his other films.\tI heard so many negative comments about this movie  so I thought it was bad. Until (now) I saw it for myself it wasn't that bad at all. It was quite interesting. At least better than The Signs.Yes  the beginning of the movie actually not that interesting and could be quite boring. But this is M. Night Shyamalan movie  he only concentrate on twisted ending (is that the good thing \u0096 I don't think so). What make this movie better than I thought was - there is more than one twist  that what make it interesting.The casting is surprising good  somewhat better than the movie. I say Bryce Dallas Howard have done a brilliant job of all. Though I was expecting a twisted ending  there are some unexpected and it let you guess  so I say he really did what he wanted in this movie.Recommendation: Yes  Rent It. But Only If You Haven't Heard About The Twisting Parts From Someone.Rating: 6.5/10 (Grade: C+) Please Rate My Review (Yes or No) After Reading It - Thanks\tThis was a brilliantly written movie! Since I had seen \""Signs\"" I almost expected this to be similar; it wasn't even close. This movie was a thriller  mystery  drama and love story all wrapped up in one. I kept expecting a certain thing to happen and then it would surprise me when it went a different way. It had so many plot twists that you would almost expect to get lost but the thread never came unwoven. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that really likes to be taken by surprise by an unexpected ending. My husband can usually figure out what's going to happen next but this one even kept him guessing. I highly recommend this movie! I've never had a movie that had such a mixture of confusion  fright  emotion and then total shock like this one did. It's an absolutely incredible movie!\tThis film is so beautifully shot  the camera work is wonderful. I love this film as i enjoy watching most of M.Night Shymalan's films. This one must be the best by fair i love it! The suspense works really well and the big twist is amazing! i was shocked i couldn't stop analysing it once i had watched it! If you haven't watched it u must miss this and you've missed out completely! The amazing thing about this is it's the only horror movie where it's not that scary it is really jumpy but it's fantastic and the story is nail biting! Watch it! The actors used for this film were a good choice Sigourney Weaver is emotional and although she isn't in it that much towards the end she does the movie a good job. I loved watching this film and i love the soundtrack James Newton Howard is a fantastic composer.\tFinally got around to seeing The Village - what a truly great film! Kind of an atmospheric and thoughtful combination of \""Babette's Feast\"" and \""The Truman Show\"" or \""Eternal Sunshine.\"" What's with Roger Ebert and some of those other negative reviews? Obviously they didn't connect with the film for some reason - or they were predisposed against Shyamalan going into The Village. Maybe they didn't like Signs? When a film successfully encompasses you in its world and has you thinking about it for days afterwards  it is a success in my book. I was totally absorbed in the world that Shyamalan created and I'm looking forward to his future films."""
Thirteen (2003),"First I would like to disagree that an actor's true age relates to that of the role they take on. If someone is 18  legal age to be allowed to display adult circumstance and improprieties and looks 13 doing it  then that is more effect than someone who is a minor playing a minor role simply because reality is not federally regulated the way American film is  (child sex still goes  on  although you can't show children having sex in a movie.) Hence \KIDS\"" now that's a movie worth it  and they didn't \""Look old doing it.\"" As for the writing  I wasn't that impressed  a lot of facts were thrown at you which couldn't be pieced together with the main plot  what relation is Brook to Evie  does Mel's boyfriend have anything to do with main plot  and to me  how is Evie such a bad influence to Tracey when (in the movie sequence) it looks like Tracey was doing it all to herself (rude to her mother  betraying close friends...) maybe they deleted the wrong scenes explaining Evie's role in that!!! i was disappointed at the end too  i believe Holly Hunter should have been given more to work with  more lines  bigger choices.as for Nikki  \""Wow...like no one would've guessed that she not only wrote it  but wrote herself in as the most popular  prettiest girl in school \"" (chuckle  chuckle ) typical!!!! it would be a lot more interesting if she were to give up that to someone who is more convincing  and good looking.oh yeah  lords of Dogtown stunk for that reason too  don't think she was worth any awards\tI loved this movie  I have seen it about 15 times. This movie is so real..and I'm 15 years old and I know that kids my age and even younger deal with all of the things that the girls in the movie have to deal with. It helped me realize a lot and what I should not/should do. I would definitely give this movie a 10 in rating. I'm going to get all of my friends to see it and maybe they'll realize exactly what I did. My mom also watched this movie and she talked to me about a lot of what happened so I would understand it all..I have talked to my brothers about all of the content too. I think kids my age really understand and would love this movie because we can easily relate to it.\t\""Thirteen\"" is one of the best movies I've ever had the pleasure of watching. It's the story of Tracy  a \""good girl\"". She had good friends  good grade  a basic goody two shoes. Then  in a desire to be cool  she meets Evie.With Evie  she engages in bad  and mostly illegal  things. Her downward spiral results in trouble in school  and huge blowups with her mother.The reason many people will find this movie wonderful is because it's so truthful and it identifies with most teenager  including myself. It IS what teenagers go through.Watch it. You won't be disappointed.\t\""Thirteen\"" is like a flipped coin  floating through space with both sides simultaneously visible. It's the most dangerous film I have ever seen. It showcases a very real and disturbing aspect of teenage life and portrays it realistically and frighteningly while showing us that there are still alternatives  positive alternatives - all without flinching  not even once. This movie will scare the masses  but will educate the few willing to accept and understand what it is trying to say. Make no mistake; this film has an \""R\"" rating for a reason.Parents will undoubtedly forbid their children from seeing \""Thirteen \"" and I don't blame them. Whilst I'm only 19 and just finished high school (not to mention a guy)  I found this movie to be a very thought provoking  as well as reminiscent of my own middle school experiences. I've seen a number of people come close to or destroy their lives because of involvement with drugs and peer pressure and all that jazz.No doubt  this film will bring up memories of another movie about kids on the edge  which was  inconsequently titled \""Kids\"" (1995). Middle school is indeed dark  dangerous  and seductive and so it's no wonder that it is so alluring to teenagers  particularly young girls who are at a crossroads in their lives. In \""Thirteen \"" directed by Catherine Hardwicke  Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood) is bombarded on a daily basis by images of the ideal middle school teenager. She has friends she hangs out with in the smart classes  but it's not enough.But we see things are more complicated than that  as her home life isn't much better: her brother Mason (Brady Corbet) is \""in\"" on the cool crowd (which may provide the catalyst for her actions) and her divorced mother Mel (Holly Hunter) and live-in boyfriend Brady (Jeremy Sisto) are both desperately holding onto AA for their dear lives while Mel's also running a hair salon out of her kitchen.Tracy wants in on the \""cool\"" stuff all the kids are into at school. She steals a purse to earn acceptance into the popular clique of girls as well as the friendship of Evie (Nikki Reed  who also co-wrote the script with director Hardwicke). Tracy soon starts smoking  drinking  stays out late  doing cocaine  hangs out with older boys  and gets things pierced. Before long  Evie has taken up residence with Tracy and Mel and then things really start to get out of control.I have no idea why American schools have deteriorated to the extreme lows they have in recent years  in that they are rapidly becoming rife with the crass materialism  futility  and utter bull**** that's common in an adult world  which is clearly unfit for teenagers. And  \""Thirteen\"" shows us that it's the young women who are paying the most dearly.At first  Mel is warm to Tracy and Evie's friendship  eager to please them both and proud Tracy has made a friend  but she finds it odd  however  that Evie seems to never want to go home. Soon  Mel is aware there's a lot more to Evie  as she begins to have a strong  negative influence on Tracy's behavior and the two are causing trouble at the house and elsewhere. Elsewhere being school  as Tracy's grades begin to slip in all her classes and pretty soon she's skipping them completely to hang out with Evie.But their troublesome friendship more closely resembles something in the dark corner of Leopold and Loeb  at least on a degree of latent bisexuality. Of course Tracy and Evie aren't lesbians  but it isn't long before they're lying in bed next to each other  cooing about how much they love one another. It's really frightening stuff  at least to me  and the jerky  hand-held camera movements are able to effectively capture the chaos of Tracy's new world.This is a dark  brave film that's definitely hard to stomach  especially since this is coming from a guy. This may be the only review written to mention \""Thirteen \"" \""Menace II Society\"" (1993) and \""Better Luck Tomorrow\"" (2002) in the same sentence  but I make these comparisons because all three films have something in common when presenting their subject matter  which is often in the most brutal and honest fashion: this subject matter is on-edge youth.9/10\tCrazy. Somewhat unrealistic. I wish that they made Tracy's family like  normal..or Evie's family normal or something. Because I mean  I think it would have been a much better movie if it was put in an ordinary situation. Like  if the parents got involved and stuff? Like  in the movie  Tracy's mom is so clueless...my mom would know everything. And what's with Evie sleeping over every night? In a normal situation  parents would not let their daughter's friend sleepover their house for weeks at a time. There are some realistic parts though. Like the drugs  sex  drinking  etc. Peer pressure. Evie does it  so Tracy does it. That's actually pretty close to real life. This movie should have definitely been called \""16\""..but I do know some 13 year old girls going through some of the same things that Tracy did in the movie.The end made me so mad. Like  during the movie  even though Evie is like \""bad\""...you sort of start to like her..just because you see the nice side of her  because she's friends with Tracy. But then the end  I just wanted to hurt her. I can't believe that she would tell Brooke about Tracy and the drugs  cutting  etc. I thought the ending was great. During the movie  my friends and I were being critics and saying that this could never happen  and we just kept talking...but by the end  we were sitting silently with our eyes glued to the screen. The acting was amazing at the end...and it just makes you think. Could this really happen? And then I think about when I was 13. There were girls like that at my age.Evan Rachel Wood is a GREAT actress. I'm surprised I haven;t seen her star in more movies. Like  it just seems so real...when she's ready to cut...she really looks depressed..and aha  she's great.I want a sequel.\tYou may assume that because the two main characters consist of teenage girls  it isn't fit for boys. But that is not true at all. This movie was wonderful. It shows the way young kids act to this day behind adults eyes. You may find it partly disturbing  finding it hard to believe  but unfortunately most of it is based on true behavior. Although some of the movie was slightely exaggerated  it still stays on the lines of real. I just saw this movie once and fell in love with the actors; Nikki Reed and Even Rachel Wood. Holly Hunter also did a very good job playing the role of Tracy's mother. You might get the feeling that Mel (Holly Hunter) wasn't being a good mother to Tracy and letting her off the hook to easily. But at a certain point  you want your kid's to trust you  and you will go to drastic measures to do so. Be sure to watch this movie. It really shows what today teens are like.\tLots of people like this movie  so I'm not going to say its garbage. But... I'm 16 years old and ill tell you that this is not how most 13 year olds act. For all the adults commenting on this movie that are guessing that this is how extreme childhood has gotten  you wrong. If these characters were real  they would all be considered ridiculous white trash. Maybe some white trash towns have 16 year olds that are like this  but 13 years old?? I wish good-looking girls would walk around like this flashing all the guys all day  but thats not how it gos. 13-year olds don't act like this  and they sure as hell don't look like this.\tI was 13 in 1987  just as a lot of things were changing  but then the rampant drinking  smoking and sexual behavior was an issue even then. I remember being this one girl who was major in the \""in\"" crowd at my school (which was Catholic  so the dress code was limited to uniforms  but the stuff I mention all happened after school). These kids had parents that worked in NYC  commuted  and the mother's had all these clubs and activities  so they were alone in the afternoon  so they'd hang out at someone's house  drink  get high  etc. I remember wondering why they seemed to be all united as \""friends\""  but never really seemed \""happy\"". Later I found out at least half of the girls had eating disorders  and the guys they invited over where \""bad boys\"" simply to just annoy their parents. The long term damage never seemed worth it to me.\tI loved this movie  all 111 minutes of it. While I have to admit  most teens really don't act like this at thirteen  I still believe that a lot of the plot holds true.While as a teen  you may not experience this kind of extreme \""bad behavior\""  you will most likely be exposed to it. The smoking and drinking is not unusual  but the loads  and loads of sex and drug use is not realistic to that age. Most teens don't start doing hard drugs until they are older.However  the issue of peer pressure is still alive  and always has been. Tracy starts doing all these things as a result of peer pressure  and that starts her on her \""road to destruction\"".Parents  be cautioned. This movie does have strong language  sexual references  and drug use. I still recommend it to teens  if they are mature enough to handle and deal with those situations  but its definitely not the movie to rent for your thirteen-year-old. Course  I did see it when I was thirteen...Ah well. It still is a good movie  and I recommend it highly to any interested viewers.\tI loved it. It was shockingly realistic. I think even after parents see this movie  they still don't believe that there kids actually do these things. Most people would be surprised at how many teenagers act like Tracy and Evie. Outstanding performances by all that were involved. I really enjoyed the movie  and was glad that some adults know what goes on in children's lives. However  neither of these girls look 13. They look more of 15. But  excluding that factor  I loved it. I would recommend it to not only minors  but to all adults as well. Know this  many of those things really happen. Although I cannot remember the actress that play Evie at the moment  she was especially wonderful.\tThis is one of the best movies I have ever watched. At the beginning you see a normal Tracy(Wood) just trying to fit in. After getting made-fun of by Evie (Reed)  she tries to change herself. Then  after a day of Petty crime in Hollywood  Tracy and Evie become fast friends. Soon the pot smoking begins  then the self-mutilation  followed by a illegal tongue-piercing  a self-done bellybutton piercing  shoplifting  and Tracy's life comes crashing down  all to the dismay of her mother (excellent acting by Holly Hunter) Then  after refusing to adopt Evie  the tables are turned on Tracy  making it seem that Tracy was the bad influence on Evie  after Evie planted all of her incriminating materials in Tracy's room. After the climax  when all of the things Tracy has been doing is revealed to her mother  the two embrace  making the viewer feel that life will be back to normal for Tracy. Excellent acting by Wood  Reed  and Hunter. And good supporting roles for Jeremy Sisto and Kara Unger.\tOkay  first of all this film is supposedly based on true events. That isn't exactly the case. I read from someone who went to the same school as Evie and the others  that half of the events portrayed in the movie never happened  or were exaggerated to a high point. Fans of this movie just want to sound cool and say that they saw it  making themselves \""in the know\"" and \""indie.\"" And by the way  I am 16 and have seen some messed up crap  but where was I when 13 year-old girls were going about their lives freely and screwing 18 year old guys  and talking sh*t to everyone. It just doesn't happen that way. In my opinion  this movie was made in order to be like some of the more truthful independent films like Bully. They tried much too hard in order to add shock value and awkward teen situations. The bottom line is  stop whining about how great this movie is. Wherever I go  \""Oh man  Did you see that movie with the messed up chicks? It was a totally amazing film. I can like  so relate to them\"" Bullsh*t you can. If you haven't seen this movie  then don't waste your time. I regret ever seeing this sack of sh*t. You want a good movie? Go see Kids or Bully.\texcuse me did i missed something?What was the point of the film?to glamorize teenage delinquency? to idolize disjointed families? a demand for a surrogate father? OK the music was fine  the hand-held camera manages to create some tension in some instances  the acting except (eve's) was adequate and not much else.Maybe the film may look very cool or hip to audiences below 25 so if you are at that age group see it  if you like something more than an MTV ride that lasts over an hour with beautiful people skip it  watch F*****G AMAL is funnier and dramatic that really grips you because of the fine acting and because it touches the larger picture (the hypocritical Swedish society).\tThis is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Do yourself a favor; unless your a pedophile or a thirteen year old drug addict do not watch this movie. It is a stereotypical teenage drug move. Teen does drugs. Teen gets hooked. Teen starts to decline in social activities and school work. Teen pushes friends away and drives parents crazy. Teen learns a lesson in life.Character development is horrible and the music is nerve racking. But nothing is worse than the god-awful script. It is by far the most predictable script ever. I hated this movie. I would give it a zero if I could  but since I can't: 1/10\tIn my eyes  Thirteen was an incredible film. Sure  many people hated this movie. That's their choice and no matter which film you see  there's bound to be someone who hates it. Yet  I think that the people who hated this movie just haven't looked deep enough into it. What makes me wonder is  why didn't Holly Hunter receive the Oscar she deserved? Why weren't Evan and Nikki at least nominated for an Oscar? Thirteen is a very unique and individual film. It's a film that you can't really put into a category. The atmosphere  emotion and message this film brings across to the audience is so real and gives you the final stab at the end of the film. It really hits you. I think that some people who hated this movie are scared of it. I think they're scared of just how much reality there is in this film and the heartbreaking proof behind it.\tI heard a lot about this movie from people that I know and through reviews and articles  so when I finally sat down to watch it I didn't know what to expect there were many comments on the level of controversy and content and my argument defending the level of shocking subjects touched on is if you take out the issues faced then the movie does not hold the qualities that it promises and therefore will not create the atmosphere of devastation and self destruction in the terrifying allure that is Cool  The movie does have strong scenes of shocking subject matter but it is only shocking because it is the thought of thirteen year old children being apart of this  the film in my opinion is probably the most impressive I have seen it touched me and I felt for Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood) who is my favourite actress  she has the difficult task of trying to fit in with the popular crowd and begins to lose control she is completely convincing as a lovely young girl who feels so obliged to fit in she is willing to change who she is  Holly Hunter who plays her mother a single mum struggling plays a vital role as she tries to bring Tracy out of what she feels to be a circle of self destruction.This movie is very entertaining but also has a very deep meaning and is a very effective film I feel that the content is one of a difficult nature that the director and cast tackle with an excellent performances and angles throughout.I would say this film is an outstanding movie that made me think a lot about the effects of peer pressure on young people in society and in conclusion to my review it is a movie that deserves to be seen but will leave you thinking  those people who think this movie is bad well its opinion but I can advise you to watch this movie if you are interested in the developing effects of peer pressure  its brilliant its shocking and its the truth and its all happening so fast I love this movie because of the way it works on so many levels 10/10\tthere's tone of movies out there now that talk about the drugs  sex  etc. But the main reason of why this movie is great is cause it written by a kid. People can say how that \"" dork \"" cant become 1 of the most popular kids in a school just cause she stole something but its true. Evie liked her cause she turned into a outgoing person and cause Tracy accepted her into the family and treated her like a sister. Tracy didn't sell out her friends just so the more popular people would know her  but cause she truly wanted different life style ( out late  the boys and stuff ). She felt more relaxed all the time with Evie . Smoking and doing the drugs let her get away with all her dad issues and problems in her life.Almost every person wants to feel relax and not have to worry about school.\tThis is by far one of the best movies i have ever seen. The plot is great and the movie just shows how life for modern teenagers are like these days. Evan Rachel Wood and Nikki Reed the main characters in the movie and for a pair of actresses who haven't had much acting experience prior to making the movie act incredibly well and this movie deserved the awards for what it won. Also other characters like holly hunter did a good job by playing Evan's mother and shows just how tough it can be for parents these days when they realise just how hard it is to control their teenage kids these days.Brilliant acting great script and overall an incredibly great movie makes this a must see A++++++++\tI felt that it was an eye-opening experience for parents especially and for that reason I loved it. It accurately showcases the complete and utter reality of the teen years. While I would say that  at times  the movie went into extremes  it does capture being that wonderful little of age of 13 in the new millennium very well. It was well-written  well-acted  and filmed just right. The \""home movie shaky-camera\"" style cinematography was dead-on. It certainly portrayed the roller coaster ride that is a teenage girl's life well.I would most definitely recommend this movie for parents of a daughter who is around the age of 13 and that they watch it with their daughter otherwise she may not \""get it\""  and if she were to watch it by herself  it may have a negative impact. Making sure that parents watch it with their daughter(s) is key so as not to mask the writer's intention thereby blowing it off as an excuse for the teen actors to \""swear  grope boys  etc.\"". This film seems to convey all to plainly to parents of teenage girls that they need to open their eyes and realize that what is portrayed in this movie does go on in America and that it can happen to your daughter just as easily as it did to Wood's character in the movie. Suffice it to say  this movie can have a positive impact and can stop this from happening to your teenage daughter before it has even started.Regardless of whether or not you have children  I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 18 (the film is Rated-R) who simply wants to see a compelling story about the rigors and pressures that teenagers face in America  and with the amazing acting talents of Jeremy Sisto  Holly Hunter  and newcomers Even Rachel Wood & Nikki Reed  it's guaranteed to shock  entertain  and educate.\tI personally do not understand all the hype which came with the film \""Thirteen\""  making it one of the most overrated indie films of the past 10 years. Because it's shocking? Well  not really. There are more realistic and shocking indies out there  which don't get the recognition they deserve. Because it's written by a thirteen year old? No  it's not even *really* written by a thirteen year old. She co-wrote the script. It shows too. OK. I'll stop with the vicious bashing and move onto an in depth review of this film.The story is very simple  a girl falls into the wrong crowd  wait not even the wrong crowd but just the wrong person and gets caught up in the fast paced whirlwind of drugs  sex and rock 'n' roll (kidding about the last one!OK I know I'm not funny). It doesn't fall into the after school special  I'll give it that. The camera-work  I can't say I didn't like the appeal of it. The dialogue was slightly shoddy  but was saved by the great acting  mainly coming from Holly Hunter.The one thing about this film is that it doesn't really show the hard side effects of drugs and that sort of lifestyle. If you want a movie which will put you off drugs for quite some time  watch Requiem for a Dream. Or if you want a movie which will put you off sex for a long time  watch Kids. The only thing it really touches on is the social effects of drugs  sex  shoplifting and drinking-the character basically loses her relationship with her very stupid mother during all of this. I did think the scenes of cutting were quite well done  though.OK  so in all it was an OK/good movie. 7/10 stars for"""
Titanic (1997),"Lot of men truly hate this movie. I don't blame them. An ultra-silly love story that is basically unrealistic as well as naive; it's a purest example of puppy love.However  I really do think this is an excellent film. You take away the love story  and you will see a very accurate portrayal of an very tragic event.There are some scenes that will break everyone's heart. One is the old couple waiting to die in their bed as their room is being consumed by water. Another is the string quartet playing music while death and destruction surround them. The scene that really wrenches my gut is when the captain commits suicide. I find these scenes very emotional mainly because they probably actually happened.Is the love story really corny? You bet. But many films such as \Crouching Tiger  Hidden Dragon\""  \""The English Patient\""  and even \""Lord of the Rings\"" have lot of silly sentimental corny love story lines but they are much more acclaimed than Titanic. I have a feeling the reason why this film got so much bad rap is that much of the audience are very young females and that their being head-over-heels over DiCaprio annoyed lot of men. (I think DiCaprio DID do a mediocre performance in this movie.) But the silly love story in my mind didn't affect the emotionally devastating impact I had watching the powerful sequences of death and dying. \""Saving Private Ryan\"" is the only other film that affected me more than \""Titanic\"" in showing the horror of human beings struggling to survive.\tThis movie is fantastic  based on a true story  the story of the unsinkable ship  (well that didn't work) Leonardo DI Caprio  Kate Winslet and Billy Zane where absolutely fantastic and how the cameras were whipped around the set design the special effects and the actors were really done well. all in all this film is in motion picture history books in my opinion. but it does get a little scary at the end and the way that Caprio died at the end it was a little too cold not just in general. Titanic is the film to watch if you want a good cry and a slight scare romance and Billy Zane at his best. Titanic will make you cry and leap for a cushion.\tGood film overall... The plot is good too  however there are mistakes within the film itself (e.g 1/: the fact that When Rose is arriving in New York half asleep  she looks at the Statue of Liberty  which is the colour green. But if you visit the statue of liberty  you'll find a plate telling you that the original colour was brown  and it took over 35 years for it to change colour. The statue of liberty was placed there in 1886  so in 1912 it should have still been partly brown.. e.g 2/: In the engine room as the ship is sinking  the smoke and steam coming from the machinery rises at the same angle as the ship  about 45 degrees. So  the shot was filmed level  then tilted afterwards).\tIn many ways Titanic is a great movie. The effects are realistic enough to let you get right into it and the performances are generally very good; especially the gorgeous Kate who convinces with  or without  her kit on. It is a story of an ill fated but grand love affair. An unhappy heiress falls for a lovely poor guy over the rich  handsome  total bastard she's engaged to and trouble inevitably follows. This epic story is played out against the backdrop of a ship sinking which adds to the emotion  poignancy  hysteria and general tearfulness of it all and therein lies my problem with this flick.Before Titanic was a film it was a ship. Many real people died. Their families still remember. (yes even a century later)  This movie is not a tribute or an insult. It is a disregarding of their memory. Jack and Rose could have had their moment in any one of a thousand scenarios. Why sully this tragic event?The sinking of the Titanic is a great historical tragedy. Not only death  but needless death  plus the loss of a magnificent machine  which was a tribute to human endeavour and ingenuity. The folly of her reckless handling in dangerous waters ( That's the ship  not Kate). The stupidity of man's \""unsinkable\"" challenge to nature. The struggle of the crew to save as many people (especially rich ones) as possible. What a great film that could be (they tried to make it in 1958). A story that respected every gasp for air  every self sacrifice  every bloody engineer. Why did we need Jack and Rose? Is this the price we pay for Hollywood.\tThis is one of those films that was so over-rated when it was first released it is not even funny. It is very interesting to note that even though this film garnered so many Academy Awards  you don't see it on any critic's top ten list and it's not even in this site's top 250! How could this be  you ask? The answer is that this is a classic example of people over reacting to the greatness of a film before really looking deeply into it. This is not even a remotely accurate portrayal of events that occurred during the Titanic's tragic maiden voyage. Instead  it is just a bunch of tripe put together by an action director. You can tell  there are many out of place witty moments that simply do not belong in a film such as this. The characters were annoying and two dimensional and you felt no compassion at all when these people were sinking out at sea. Actually  these people were a bunch of arrogant jerks that deserved to die! The film simply did not show enough of the poor people in the under decks to even give a damn about them  they just showed far too much of Jack and Rose in all their silly Blue Lagooniness.This film really did have potential  it really did  and it's not even all bad. The second half of the film with the boat sinking is some of the best action ever to be put on film. But this was not enough to save this film from sinking into mediocrity. I have to give James Cameron props for trying his skillful hand at drama  but man  go back to making action films--that is definitely your strong suit.\tWhy did this movie made 600million dollars at the box office?it's because you people loved it.Why is this movie only rate 6.9 out of 10?It's because 10 000 people in the world didn't like it and those 10 000 votes on IMDb and the hole world would've voted on IMDb for titanic this movie would've been and 8.8 out of 10.Why is this movie not in the top 250?Well because there is not enough voters on IMDb.I don't know why people didn't like this wonderful masterpiece.Maybe because you don't like love stories and who ever doesn't shouldn't of watch this one then and go do bad comments on it.And maybe people didn't like it because it is a remake  well get over it  I like this one way more then the 1953 version and plus I like all the remakes because if Iwonna watch Walking tall well I have the choice between the good one or the bad oneI don't know why people didn't like the story.I think the story is great there could'nt of been a better one that shows the gigantic boat (titanic) sink in the middle of the Atlantic.Every thing is wonderful about this movie  the actors the characters  the music  the visual effects  the scenery  and every thing else.Leonardo DiCaprio should've gotten en award for his great performance and Kate Winslet should've gotten one too.\tTitanic is one of those films that you have to see. It's one of those films that can reduce almost anybody to tears  if not for one storyline then for the other.Unless you've had your head in the sand ever since this film was released then you'll know the two stories this film revolves around. The first is the obvious one  the true story of the 'unsinkable ship'. The tragic tale of an unimaginable catastrophe. The second is the fictional love story  the collision of lives that could only have happened aboard the ship. The love story starts off pretty simple  the classic example of a romantic film plot. Boy meets girl and they fall in love  love is forbidden but they fight for their love and this is normally where they'd all live happily ever after. Now that's where the first storyline confuses things because as well all know on this ship  most of the passengers didn't survive the journey.Like I said this is a film that can reduce almost anybody to tears. Whether the reason is the tragic reality of the disaster that was the Titanic or the love story that touched the world. Leonardo DiCaprio is perfect for the role of Jack Dawson  likewise Kate Winslet  Rose and Gloria Stuart tells the story beautifully as the future Rose.The film itself is very poorly made by today's standards  especially considering it cost more to make than the original ship did. The computer graphics are spectacularly bad  but all that seems insignificant.This film is a big deal and you can never fully join in film discussions until you've seen it. Love it or hate it  it's a story that will stick with you for a long time.The unfortunate thing is that now  think of the Titanic and you think of the tragic love story  you think of Jack and Rose. Nobody ever thinks of the tragedy that was the 'ship of dreams'.\tThis is the best of the sappy melodramatic films to come out in the past years  but it is still not that great of a movie. I cannot stand Billy Zane's character. He is such a stereotypical rich guy  it makes me sick. No this is not a bad movie  but it is not great and did not deserve the academy award over LA Confidential  but that is not why I am giving it 6 out of 10. I think this movie lost a point just by making it seem like it was Rose/Jacks fault that the Titanic sunk  remember when the watch guards are not doing their job and watching Jack and Rose make out instead of looking for icebergs  they make it seem like they were partially responsible for it. I must admit Kate Winslet is gorgeous in this movie  but it does not make up for it.\tTitanic is Hollywood's biggest moneymaker in history and for good reason - it is a great movie. This movie is about sacrifice  selflessness  love  devotion  joy  passion  all occurring on a doomed ocean liner that suddenly and without warning sinks  resulting in one of the worst maritime catastrophes in history. Kate Winslett is magnificent as the young girl  Rose  barely a teenager  who is being pressured by her overbearing mother to marry Cal  a nasty  brutal man who has only contempt for his unwilling fianc\u00e9. That Cal is rich just makes his behavior worse. Rose  by nature a gentle spirit  is angry and desperate to escape  so much so that she is about to commit suicide when she is saved by a young man  Jack  who  despite his shabby appearance  is a well-traveled  sensitive and upbeat artist who treats the troubled young lady with gentleness and respect and she responds. Their love for each other is instantaneous and unconditional and they are willing to die for each other. This is not such an implausible scenario and there is absolutely nothing immoral about their behavior. Rose willingly gives herself to Jack out of love for him  and even decades later still thinks of him as her one and only true love  the man who died for her so she could live. That is love. That is sacrifice. That is life. That is Christian. That they were not formally married is a mere technicality. Given the circumstances of their meeting. a loving and understanding G-d will forgive them. Now regarding the diamond that was given to Rose  instead of cashing it in like she could have  she kept it as a memento to her one true love. That is called character. Nothing unchristian about that. Indeed  the movie is actually about how Rose undergoes a complete transformation from a passive  unhappy  moody adolescent into a composed  mature  independent and beautiful woman  even changing her name  now prepared to go on to live a long and active life. That is  she experiences an epiphany. That is called personal growth which is quite Christian and most exemplary. As for Jack  he is with Rose in spirit and she lives her life accordingly  knowing that if it were not for him she would not have survived. Jack gave his life for Rose so she could live. That is powerfully compelling and completely consistent with Christian teachings.Maybe I shouldn't say this  but I will: I was waiting for the ship to sink because I was hoping that when the ship sank the movie would end ... but it didn't  and for that I was disappointed. To me  the story of the the Titanic is what happened to the ship  not some contrived  fictional  and highly improbable love story between a Little Miss Rich Girl and a Mr. Nice Guy Ne'er Do Well. The movie is weak for two reasons: First  the movie is asking me to believe that a young lady would dump her handsome  powerful  influential and above-all wealthy fianc\u00e9 who has her mother's approval in favor of a no-account nobody who didn't even belong on the ship. Second  since we already know what's going to happen to the ship  much of the excitement is lost. Nevertheless  the portrayal of how the ship actually sank  and the resulting pandemonium  was effectively done. So if the movie had gotten rid of the love story and concentrated instead on how the passengers and crew coped with the impending sinking of the ship  that could have been the basis for an exceedingly dramatic story. But Hollywood being Hollywood  if the story doesn't include at least a smidgen of sex and a big dose of sentimentality  no matter how contrived  then that story won't be the one that makes it onto the screen  and this movie is proof of that statement. As further proof of that statement consider the final scene in which Little Miss Rich Girl  who's now something like 100 years old and a great-grandmother  tosses a multimillion-dollar diamond overboard in the name of love. Even for a movie that's unbelievable. It would have been better if she had used the diamond to pay for a salvaging operation to recover the divan on which she had posed nude for her boyfriend  Mr. Nobody  who  by sheer coincidence  also happened to be an accomplished artist. (Duh!) Now THAT would have made for a good story. The movie could have been entitled: \""The Titanic - The Story of a Woman and the Divan that Made Her Famous.\"" Now if somebody out there would like to advance me 50 or 100 million dollars to make this movie  then we'll be in business.\tIt was brave of James Cameron to attempt an undertaking on this scale. Making the world's most expensive movie ever is always to tempt fate; the film which had previously held that distinction  the Kevin Costner vanity project \""Waterworld\""  had been a disaster in both financial and artistic terms. Even before \""Titanic\"" was finished  rumours were circulating that it would be equally disastrous; the critics began preparing their \""sinking ship\"" metaphors in anticipation of its failure.In the event  of course  the critics were confounded; the film was a great success  both at the box office and with the Academy  who awarded it eleven Oscars including best picture and best director. It became the most talked-about film of 1997. Eight years on there have been other films on a similar epic scale and some of the excitement it provoked has died away. Nevertheless  even today it stands out as a fine achievement.\""Titanic\"" combines two quite different genres  the disaster movie and the \""heritage\"" costume drama. The late nineties saw a modest revival of the disaster picture  that quintessentially seventies genre  with \""Twister\"" in 1996 and \""Dante's Peak\"" and \""Volcano\"" the following year. Cameron took the basic formula for such films and applied it to a real historical event  making a film on a grand scale with lavish attention to period detail. The real Titanic sinking had a number of features which fitted the genre; it is something of a convention of disaster movies that the disaster should be caused  or at least exacerbated  by the incompetence or complacency of those in authority  an element emphasised here. Bruce Ismay  the Chairman of the White Star Line  proudly proclaims the ship unsinkable  then causes the disaster by urging the captain to steam at top speed through an ice-field. To make matters worse  the company have neglected to provide sufficient lifeboats for all on board.Cameron also imported into the film some of the conventions of \""heritage cinema\"". That genre has often been used to examine the British class system  often in films which feature romances between individuals from different social backgrounds  such as Losey's \""The Go-Between\"" or Merchant-Ivory productions like \""Howard's End\"". Cameron takes the same concept and uses the film to examine the historical roots of the American class system  of which the ship  with its first  second and third class passengers  is a microcosm. Intertwined with the story of the tragedy is the story of the romance between Rose Dewitt Bukater  daughter of an aristocratic Philadelphia family  and Jack Dawson  a struggling artist from a working-class background.The America that we see is not  as is sometimes said  a classless society  nor even one where class is solely determined by wealth. The Dewitt Bukaters  for all their old-money pretensions  are in financial difficulties  and Rose's late father died heavily in debt. Rose's mother Ruth sees that the only way to maintain the family's social status will be if Rose makes a \""good\"" marriage to a wealthy man  and a seemingly ideal candidate has presented himself in the shape of Cal Hockley  the son of a nouveau-riche industrialist. Unfortunately  Cal is an arrogant  selfish snob  and Rose cannot bear the thought of marriage to him. She considers suicide by throwing herself off the ship  but is dissuaded from doing so by Jack  and the two fall in love.Some have criticised the film for concentrating on the romance of Jack and Rose  arguing that this focus is somehow demeaning to a real-life tragedy in which over a thousand people died. This is not a criticism with which I would agree. It would clearly have been impossible to tell the personal stories of all those who died; Cameron's aim was to put the disaster into context and heighten its impact by giving us two characters we can care about and to make their story representative of the stories of all those caught up in the drama  thus heightening the film's emotional impact.The film has a number of weaknesses. The liberties taken with historical accuracy  such as the denigration of the character of William Murdoch (who in real life died bravely)  can sometimes seem offensive. The opening scenes and closing  which deal with the attempts of a modern salvage team to recover from the wreck a valuable jewel given by Cal to Rose  were possibly unnecessary and certainly overlong  and could easily have been pruned. The acting is not always very good; I was less than impressed by Leonardo Di Caprio as Jack. (In fairness it must be said that he has greatly improved as an actor since 1997  having given a good performance in \""Catch Me If You Can\"" and an excellent one in \""The Aviator\""). Kate Winslet as Rose was better  although even she fell short of the brilliance she had shown in \""Heavenly Creatures\"".The weaknesses are  however  greatly outweighed by the film's strengths. A special mention must go to James Horner's evocative score and Celine Dion's song \""My Heart Will Go On\"". There are a number of good performances in minor roles  from Kathy Bates as Molly Brown  shunned as vulgar by her fellow first-class passengers but more good-hearted than any of them  Bernard Hill as Captain Smith  a decent man but without the strength of character to stand up to Ismay's bullying  and Frances Fisher as Ruth  a woman who puts her social status ahead of her daughter's happiness. In the end  however  this is not a film one watches for the acting. I would agree with the reviewer who said that the real star is neither Kate nor Leo but rather the great ship itself  particularly during the spectacular scenes after it hits the iceberg. The success of \""Titanic\"" gave Hollywood back the self-confidence to make pictures on a grand scale with daring  energy and imagination  leading to recent epics such as \""Gladiator\"" and \""Troy\"". 8/10\tFor me  time is valuable and to take time to watch a movie is a big thing. Yet with TITANIC  I would watch it everyday if I could and I would not get tired of it. People protest at its two-day love story  and say that \""Captain Smith was a man who  realizing his mistake of ignoring the ice-berg warning personally took on the responsibility of checking the damages himself.\"" That is true  and though I love the movie  I do wish that they had shown that.Leonardo DiCaprio (THE AVIATOR  WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GILBERT GRAPE?) deserved a Oscar nomination for his endearing portrayal of the live-for-the-moment young man named Jack Dawson.Kate Winslet (ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND FINDING NEVERLAND) was the up and coming actress who was chosen for the part of Rose Dewitt Bukater. Her brilliant performance earned a Best Actress nomination  though it deserved the actual Oscar.The second part of the movie (Spoiler Warning)  in of which R.M.S. Titanic sinks is touching  well done  mainly accurate  and very sad. Not only do you cry when the now beloved Jack dies  but also when Rose(Gloria Stuart)  84 years later  dies after telling her story for the first time. Victor Garber Frances Fisher Kathy Bates and Billy Zane add notable performances in this epic love story and tragedy.\tAlthough this is a fictional account of the event  I feel it is perhaps the best portrayal of life and times of the Titanic era. It is a strong warning against overconfidence in our technical abilities and human pride to solve every problem and prevent disaster. Ignoring iceberg warnings and failure to take precautions  even in matters of the ship's design and number of lifeboats  depict human error as the frequent cause of failure it is. Man's greatness pales in the face of nature and nature's God.One cannot relate to history without putting a face on it. Kate Winslet's beautiful face (and the others) do the job superbly. Everything about this film is wonderful  including the writing  photography and acting. Instead of dry textbooks  school children should view this  with some precautions against nudity and unnecessarily strong language. I find the story very satisfying  cleverly executed and highly informative. No doubt this will be a perpetual monument to that \""unsinkable\"" ship and all those who died.\tThis is my #1 favorite movie of all time. It's a must see! This movie made me bawl so hard. The music is also really great too. Especially the love theme  My Heart Will Go On  performed by my favorite singer  Celine Dion. If you like this movie you will probably also like Gone With The Wind  Legends of the Fall  and others. Usually romance stories on film never turn out to be good  considering that they are all mostly romantic-comedies. This is a very good story and it has a great plot. The dialauge is awesome and the special effects are mind blowing  not to mention the acting. This movie is great and if you haven't seen it rent it or buy it. It is definitely worth the money.\tI thought that \""Titanic\"" was wonderful. History and romance all rolled into one. James Cameron did a marvelous job. and the soundtrack is beautiful. I laughed and i cried. This movie is the best to quote from and use in your everyday life. I live by these words. Kate Winslet was stupendous. A wealthy woman trapped in her own life is a difficult role to play. The romance was a great way to catch people's attention. The way Cameron captured every little detail so that you could really understand the emotion and wonder in this production  was beyond me. if you are one of the thousands that enjoy history  and a little romance you will surely enjoy this film.\tThis is one hell of a movie. The acting was bloody brilliant and the storyline was good. It also had some sad parts such as when Rose tries to get Jack to wake up because the boat has arrived  and discovers that he has died and when she lets go of him  she stares at his face as he sinks down to the bottom. I actually cried after watching this. It was actually pretty cool when the guy on the new boat asks what Rose's name is  she says \""Rose. Rose Dawson.'' That proved how much she loved him. Basically  this is a great movie to watch and you can see what kind of thing happened when the real Titanic was sinking. I give this movie 10/10 all the way.\tI was clicking around and saw that Titanic was the highest Grossing movie to date globally and I just don't understand what the big deal about this film was. There's been a thousand love stories where one lover dies at the sake of another: Cruel Intentions w/ Sebastian and Annette  West side story w/ Tony and Maria  Romeo+Juliet w/ Juliet thinking Romeo's dead  she cant live without him and that's d**n romantic. I'll admit the sets and costumes are gorgeous but the story's not that extraordinary-rich girl in an arranged society/political marriage with a loveless fianc\u00e9 meets the charming almost always artistic poor boy who whirls her off her feet with the simple romantic things in life only to have the relationship be tragically struck down by fate-cough  cough-THE NOTEBOOK-cough\u0085I don't mean to be trash Titanic  just someone tell me what makes it so d**n special? NOTE: And saying Leo DiCaprio/ Kate Winslet is in it doesn't count\tIt's a crying freaking shame that this outstanding movie's rating has been dragged down by small people who hate it because it was successful. You should be ashamed of yourselves. When I first saw it I thought it was the perfect movie  and it's still one of my favorites 8 years later. It's got sexual tension  action  social commentary  and the acting doesn't suck. It's even got Bill Paxton  one of my top 10 criteria for a great movie. What's so horrible about it that it deserves an aggregate 6.9? The only reason I can think of is this perverse habit people have of hating anything that makes so much money or is otherwise successful that it makes them doubt their own worth. That's just sad  and you shouldn't take it out on an innocent blockbuster.\tI first went to see this movie when i was eight years old. Because i was young i did not get the concept of the movie  therefore i did not fall in love with the characters as i did when i got older. The characters are Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCaprio)  a poor man who won two tickets on Titanic by having a luckily hand in poker. His friend Fabrizio  an Italian man  accompanies him. During the trip Jack saves a woman named Rose(Kate Winslet)  who was attempting suicide. As a reward Rose's fianc\u00e9  Cal  invites Jack to dinner along with them and the first class. During the next day  Rose gets to know this man who saved her  and she finds to love him  and not her fianc\u00e9. Towards the ending  when the ship is sinking  Rose must choose between her rich fianc\u00e9 Cal  or the man she loves  Jack. Although this may seem as a sappy love story  it is still really about the \""unsinkable\"" ship Tianic. Titanic  the ship and its passengers has been one of the most intriguing things that I've ever studied. as the ship is sinking they only let women and children on to the lifeboats first  but then they do not let out the people 3rd class  and you see a woman telling her children a bedtime story  because she knows that there is just no hope of surviving. This movie will make your eyes water  if the least. Its a long  but very good movie. i have seen it about 6 or 7 times and i still cry every time. James Cameron has done a great job on this movie. without the music  and the actors  this movie wouldn't of been the same.\tI never thought I would ever see such a masterpiece that is \""Titanic\"". If James Cameron never makes another film he can always be proud of this movie. Some people say  \""it's just about a boat sinking\"". How naive they are. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are amazing as Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukator. I saw this movie three times at the theaters  and would go again today if it were re-released. I still get goosebumps watching the \""flying scene\"" and the \""heaven scene\"". No other movie can compete with this one. How dare the Oscars not nominate Leo for his performance. Kate Winslet was robbed in my opinion for Best Actress. Helen Hunt (\""As Good As it Gets\"") over Kate  please. Gloria Stuart (\""The Invisible Man\"")  Billy Zane (\""Dead Calm\"")  Frances Fisher (\""Unforgiven\"")  Kathy Bates (\""Misery\"")  Bill Paxton (\""Twister\"")  Victor Garber (TV's \""Alias\"")  and Eric Braedon (TV's \""The Young and the Restless\"") co-star. This is a must-see masterpiece.\t...WELL  maybe that's a slight stretch - but hey  I'm sure there were (and are) numerous good reasons for this movie's unprecedented success  like mainly: the invincible combination of two \""hot\"" young actors; an established action/adventure director; a bloated budget that nevertheless served to show off some seriously cutting-edge sets  costumes  effects  etc; a classic love story set against one of the most tragic backdrops in early-twentieth-century history; and  of course  leading from all aforementioned reasons  the sheer curiosity from countless critics and moviegoers alike  to see just exactly what all the hype was about - which obviously paid off  making it the highest-grossing film worldwide (still! After nearly a decade!)  and one of three tied record holders for the most Oscars won by a film.Yes  I understand that box-office status does not necessarily reflect quality (though I think recent failed releases like \""Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo\"" prove otherwise); however  I'm of the opinion that maybe - just maybe - the massive mainstream viewing public got it right one time."""
Troy (2004),"The story was contrived  unbelievable  the acting silly. The battle scenes were rather gory and intense but most dramatic scenes felt contrived. Eric Bana was the only redeeming factor. Brad Pitt was completely miscast as one of the leading characters. It was hard to believe him as Achilles. The final showdown was well choreographed and I was surprised about the outcome. In one scene Achilles slave-girl friend as him \when does it end?\"" and Brad Pitt answers \""It never ends\""...exactly my sentiments.\tI don't understand people who think that the movie was bad because it wasn't true to the Illiad. Here is what it said: *Inspired* by the Illiad. I thought the movie was amazing. They made it deeper than just a war movie. I like that this movie actually had character development. The battle scenes were done perfectly  it's worth seeing only if you want to see Achilles(Brad Pitt) fight. Now for the acting: I thought Brad Pitt did an outstanding job as Achilles. It made me feel like he actually Was Achilles. He gave an outstanding performance. People think he is no good and became famous because he is good looking  no he became famous despite that fact.Another outstanding performance was given by Sean Bean. I don't know why so few even mention him. I would give him an Oscar for the role. He stole the scenes he was in. I couldn't have imagined a better Oddiseyus. I am amazed!Of course we all know who the \""weakest links\"" are : Orlando Bloom was just flat  he did nothing with his character and neither did the actress who played Helen.I watched this movie a number of times and the more I watch it the more I get the feeling that some actors are just reciting their lines.On the other hand  the more I watch the movie the more I am amazed by Pitt Bean. Also I would like to point out the actress who played Brisseis- Rose Byrne. She did a very good job and she is very pretty.:)All I know is everyone sees what they are able to see. Some only see the outside glow of this movie  well I could only feel sorry for those. I would say that this movie is not for people under a certain age and a certain mental ability.It is an amazing movie.\tWhere do you start with this dog? First of all it is pretty pleasing to the eye  with lots of action & spectacle. But that's about it. This is History as viewed through the lens of a Schwarztnegger movie.For a start Achilles never entered the walls of Troy  he died outside. Also Agamemnon lived well beyond the battle well before the fall of Troy. There's lots besides that  including the usual rubbish of sword play. Has anyone EVER tried to stick even the sharpest sword into someone? I was lucky that I never had to bayonet anyone  but I've spoken to people who have & they all told me that you just can't go up to someone & go \""HAH!\"" & have a blade go right through. Don't forget you've got to add in the protection of armour & the fact that the ancient Greek blades wouldn't have been as sharp or tough as modern examples. We know from Roman chronicles that the legionnaires weren't so stupid as to have their swords bounce off the enemy  they went for the legs  preferably the ankles  to drop your opponent where you could cut his throat or just let them bleed to death. The fight sequences shown in \""Troy\"" are  as a result  totally fatuous.There's lots of sneering  grunting  clunky dialogue & even worse acting. This has to be the Pitts for Brad  I've never seen him so one dimensional  it is as if he didn't want to be there at all. Brian Cox goes a long way to rescuing the characterisations on screen with his Agamemnon & Sean Bean does what he can with the role of Odysseus (a role so truncated as to be almost erased from the story altogether) but the supporting cast of various sorts just get by as if going by-the-numbers.Peter O'Toole makes a watchable Priam  but his age seems to get the better of him  his sonorous repetition of \""The Gods\"" this & \""The Gods\"" that seldom allow him to rise above the mediocre. However that is something of an achievement give the standard of the rest of the cast.Diane Kruger as Helen is eye candy  end of story. Orlando Bloom shows promise as Paris  but the part seldom allows him to develop. However I do like the fact that he shows barely disguised fear when entering into battle  which is probably something closer to the truth than the romaticised tales handed down by the Greek poets who recorded these events at the time.Of course the big sticking point with anything dealing with Greek history is the touchy subject of homosexuality. The Greeks placed such a high value on female virginity that recreational sex had to find an outlet somewhere & man-on-man action was the only alternative  assuming you had no captive women to be your sex slaves. The latter is clearly mentioned  but not shown  the former doesn't even appear by inference  but Greek records are clear that this was a normal & every day affair. However  as we have already seen  Hollywood has little respect for the truth or accuracy (which is why such awful tripe as U517 got made).Finally the CGI is often obvious & clunky  especially when the large formation so Greeks or Tojans are shown marching. I've seen better animations in Role Playing computer games. This is definitely not up to the superb standard of CGI in The Lord of the Rings. But then if it was smooth & natural it would seem out of place amongst the creaking script & the clunky acting.Chug lots of beer & settle down with a pizza if you want to make this an enjoyable experience. If you've any previous knowledge of Greek history then avoid this or you'll throw up  no matter how much beer you've had.\tSince \""historical accuracy\"" is a theme in the discussion of this movie  it is ironic that so many have now rushed to defend it and suggest that the critics were wrong. Unfortunately  most of the acting and dialogue really is that bad. Brad Pitt  who has shown he can act when he wants to (Fight Club  Ocean's Eleven)  unfortunately falls into the trap of self-importance that marred his one-note performance in Legends of the Fall. He also seems to buy into the notion that any character in a would-be swords-and-sandals epic must speak with a muddled British accent. His flat delivery is laughable and makes Achilles seem like he is pouting when he should be tormented. Thankfully  Brian Cox seems to realize that the script is sub par  so he compensates by gleefully chewing the scenery. He at least injects some life in his scenes. Bana is game enough  and manages (for the most part) to defeat some more of the ludicrous dialogue. Diane Kruger  however  does nothing to suggest why Helen was worth all the fuss. Orlando Bloom's facial expressions while watching the Hector-Achilles duel are so bad they would seem sub par in an Ed Wood movie.The screenplay is especially disappointing  given that David Benioff wrote the excellent script for 25th Hour. His take on demystifying the legend by giving real motivations for the character's actions is actually quite inspired  especially as to why Greece would really want to invade Troy. However  these story elements are eventually sunk by the insipid dialogue (\""There are no pacts between men and lions\"" and \""It is too early in the day for killing princes\"" wouldn't even cut it in a Star Wars prequel). The notable exception is a scene between Priam and Achilles  which finally fleshes out some of the relationships in the movie.Not all is lost  however. Peter O'Toole gracefully elevates every scene in which he appears. The scene in Achilles' tent is a tribute to both him and David Benioff. They turn this into a great scene despite Pitt's dreadful line deliveries and laughable attempts to seem conflicted. The well-choreographed duel between Achilles and Hector is a worthy set piece. Saffron Burrows and Sean Bean also excel in (unfortunately) lesser roles.Overall  the worthy parts are not enough to compensate for the half-baked whole. Given that this involves one of the cornerstone stories in world mythology  consider this film to be a great opportunity missed.\tI was looking forward to seeing this movie & sadly  I was very disappointed. As a Classics Student  I was appalled at the changes that were made. There is a reason that this is a classic story  but the film-makers obviously chose to ignore it. They left the most basic elements in and took out many key elements. After awhile  I lost interest due to being distracted by all of the errors in this classic tale. If your going to make a movie out of one of the most important stories of the ancient world  you had better stick to the tale. There's a reason why \""The Iliad\"" is a classic. Learn it!!ERRORS IN \""TROY\"" (2004) \""The Iliad\"" has no mention of Thessaly in it. The war has already been on for 10 yrs. when \""the Iliad\""starts. Patroclus is FRIEND not cousin to Achilles. Gods do not play important role in the movie  unlike the book. \""The Iliad\"" ends with Hector's funeral. Hector does NOT kill Menelaus; Menelaus leaves w/Helen & they have a life together. Aphrodite saves Paris from Menelaus NOT Hector. Hector vs. Ajax is a one-on-one combat  no other fights take place during it & Ajax does NOT die in the fight. Briseis is NOT cousin to Hector NOR a priestess  therefore she shouldn't be returned to Troy; seems her character is merged w/\""Chryseis\"". Hector takes Achilles armor & wears it after Patroclus'death. Agamemnon is not killed in \""the Iliad\""; he is later killed by his wife & her lover in Aeschylus'\""Agamemnon\"". Sack of Troy is NOT in\""the Iliad\"". Briseis & Achilles are NOT in love. There is no \""Trojan Horse\""nor is it Odysseus'idea. Helen feels contempt for Paris after fight w/Menelaus. Trojans hate Helen. No mention of Cassandra  a clairvoyant Trojan princess. Achilles dies BEFORE the Trojan Horse. Aeneas is older than shown. Helen  Andromache  & Astyanax (Hector's son) do NOT leave Troy. Andromache becomes a slave & Astyanax is thrown from walls. The movie takes elements from \""the Aeneid\"". And most of the Greek names were mispronounced.\tYou'd think this film was another Ishtar if you'd paid attention to some of the critics when it came out. Troy is a modern-day epic loosely based on the poem of Homer written centuries ago. We see what happens when young prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) seduces and steals away with another king's wife and takes her back to the heavily fortified city of record. All the kingdoms of Greece align and attack the city with everything they've got. The result is one hell of an entertaining film.I am not well versed in ancient Greek history or mythology. Apparently this film differs greatly from Homer's poem  but since I am only vaguely familiar with the story  that was not a problem for me. Much of the mythology surrounding the story was dropped to make it look like a historically plausible picture. We are left with a story about warlords who pray to Greek gods  but are very much mortal.The film has large cast made up of great actors (O'Toole  Cox  Bean) and people who are just nice to look at (Pitt  Bloom  Kruger). The script has some cheesy lines  but most of the actors give as much dignity as they can to them. Apparently this film was a very negative experience for O'Toole who was reportedly so unhappy with director Wofgang Petersen  that he refused to see the final product. That's unfortunate  since O'Toole gives the film's best performance. Brad Pitt plays a brooding and vengeful Achillies. His acting skills aren't quite right for this part  but any women in the audience are sure to be impressed by his physique. It took him nearly six months to attain those muscles  and the results are impressive for any man his age.The battle scenes are brutal and exciting. There are some characters in this film that can whip some butt. Eric Bana and Brad Pitt have a fun  but too brief one on one match at one point. The large-scale archery effect is getting a little old. We've already seen it in Braveheart  Gladiator  and the Lord of the Rings movies  so the spectacle isn't as awesome this time. Most of the effects are computer generated  but look good enough.The film is a little long  but it won't cause you to daydream. The film had ridiculously high budget ($185 000 000)  and it failed to make that money back in theaters. DVD sales and rentals over the years may yet make it a profitable venture. Heck  even Waterworld has about broken even after all these years of being on the market for home ownership.If you're looking for an exciting story with tremendous production values  then Troy is right for you. I consider it to be a superior film to Gladiator  and that one snuck away with an Oscar.9 of 10 stars. The Hound has spoken.\tThe movie Troy has some entertaining parts and Eric Bana does a nice job of playing Hector  but don't mistake this for anything close or faithful to the original story. As noted in the trivia/errors section for this movie  a number of characters die in the movie that survive in the poem (at least until later times)  much of the equipment and battle techniques are wrong  and the core of the Achilles character is totally wrong. In the Illiad Achilles is vain  powerful  proud  and given to fits of anger and intense jealousy and hurt feelings. The movie attempts to show this by having him fly into a rage when his war prize is taken by Agamemmnon. Achilles is supposedly upset by this because he has some kind of deep feeling for her. In the poem  it is quite clear that he attached no particular importance to her other then as a prize he has won in battle. He is enraged when she is taken not because he loves her  but because it is a loss of face in front of the men to be upstaged by a king he feels is unworthy of the title. There is no love interest plot line(unless you want to suggest a homosexual one between Achilles and Patrocolus). I understand that the writer/director had to condense a lot of material  but a lot of these changes just don't make sense. The Illiad is not a poem about war. Otherwise  it wouldn't start the narrative nine years into a ten year siege that we also don't see the end of. It's about human passion and emotion and becoming more human  as well as telling an entertaining story of conquest and battle. It was the action movie blockbuster of its time but still had 1000% more heart and humanity then the adaptation. Whoever wrote this movie may have read the poem  but they clearly didn't understand it. Some nice acting  but a poor job of translating the story to the big screen.\tHollywood can bring anyone down. Even Wolfgang Petersen. Want evidence? Just watch his brilliant Das Boot  one of the most riveting war movies ever made and then watch this piece of Hollywood junk. Big Battle formula #1 calls for pretty faces  blizzard edits of slashing  no gory injuries (superficial slashes are better)  wide angle shots of two huge armies running at each other  protagonists who will fight in the last \""meaningful\"" scene. You've seen it before ad nauseam  here you see it again. Mix in numerous close up of anguished heroines watching the battle and that's about it for this picture. As opposed to Das Boot where the viewer actually comes to care about what is happening  Hollywood Big Battle Formula #1 ensures no more involvement than you would get from your video game. Not a coincidence  that's the audience they had in mind. Too bad the \""creative people\"" in Hollywood are MBA's.\tOK - so the guy can't direct anything with Gods in it so he takes them out. Fair enough. He assembles a cast of a thousand accents. Fair enough.But Brad Pitt's accent? Give me a break. I've seen Pitt (and not just for the flesh) and he can act so what happened here? His voice is SO completely wrong it was hard to concentrate on anything else. The story \""inspired\""  rather dragged from  the Iliad lacks any sort of emotional power without the gods and the hinted-at homosexuality.If you like sword & sandal flicks you may get into this  otherwise  beware.p.s. Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole shone in a lacklustre casting\tThis movie suffers somewhat from negative publicity. Before it even hit the cinemas critics were writing it off. Never one to accept the critics views at face value  I went along to the cinema to check it out for myself. I have to say I found in thoroughly entertaining. It makes Homer's epic poem very accessible and fulfills the role of great escapist cinema very well. Brad Pitt is perfectly cast as Achilles and there are also memorable performances from Brendan Gleeson and Peter O Toole. Orlando Bloom and Eric Banna let the movie down slightly. I can just never take Orlando Bloom seriously. He'll never play anything other than romantic leads. The battle scenes are particularly powerful and some of the cinematography is quite breathtaking. Especially the thousand Greek ships sailing for Troy to bring back Helen. When it was released on DVD I bought it immediately.So don't be dissuaded by the critics  this movie is well worth renting at least.\tNot only is this movie not true to the Iliad  which is forgivable  it is a horrible film technically as well. Troy is some of the most atrocious editing and cinematography I've ever seen in a major motion picture. My theory is that the writer(s) wanted to write an atheist and pro-Trojan take on the Trojan War. This goal is admirable and in and of itself is a fine task. It would be like writing the Passion of the Christ through Judas' eyes- different and intriguing. The director/producer team  however  must have missed that and tried simply to make a popcorn movie out of what could have been a great film. What was with all of the slow motion cuts and jarring zooms? Why was the editing so ridiculously spotty? And please tell me how it is that Achilles could spar with his \""cousin\"" at the ruins at Delphi if the Trojan War took place when those ruins would have been a completed temple? Did no one see that glaring mistake? Ridiculous. This movie is sloppy at best and anyone giving it a rating of anything over a 3 out of 10 has obviously much lower standards for what should have been one of the defining epics of our time  along with films like the Lord of the Rings Trilogy or Saving Private Ryan. Seriously  aside from Eric Bana and Brian Cox  this movie has absolutely no value to anyone more than a simple popcorn movie with beautiful people to look at for two hours.\tI really can't cope. From an antiquary and archaeological point of view \""Troy\"" is the only serious film about ancient Greece I have ever seen. Nevertheless  a lot of silly things have been said and written about it. Why? Because the gods are excluded from the action? There are lots of ancient and modern retellings of the story which exclude the gods. Or because Hector shows scepticism about the \""winged messages\"" alleged by Trojan priests? But this is Homer (Iliad  book 12). Religion  temples and sanctuaries in ancient Greek epics are a very difficult and delicate matter. The movie treats this subject with intelligence and information. In the Mycenean era  the temples were usually annexed to the royal palaces  and this is very well shown in \""Troy\"". But Homer (and later epics) tell about independent sanctuaries  such as the one of Athena (Ilias  book 6)  which is probably an anachronism  just like the temple of Apollo Tymbraeus  sacked by Achilles out of the walls of Troy (Cyprian tales  Apollodorus and so on). The Greek religious architecture begins in the VIII-VII centuries b.C.: the movie tries to reconstruct a temple belonging to that time  with reference to insular and \""Orientalizing\"" evidence (Gortina  Prinias). But the most intolerable mistake I read in some reviews concerns the building where Achilles trains with Patroclus. The movie was located in Malta and Mexico...so  please  remember that there are NO Greek temples in Malta or in Mexico. The structure is a MENHIR  placed in Malta  and dating back to the third millennium b.C. There were menhirs also in Greece  and obviously we can suppose they were ruined when the Trojan war was beginning. It is possible that Achilles trained in the ruins of a menhir  and in any case the idea is very suggestive.\tAchilles: (to his men) Myrmidons! My brothers of the sword! I would rather fight beside you than any army of thousands! Let no man forget how menacing we are  we are lions! Do you know what's waiting beyond that beach? Immortality! Take it! It's yours!That speech  I find ironic as this was the movie that could have become infamous as a film  a proper classic  in the vein of \""Spartacus\""  \""Gladiator\"" or even \""Jason And The Argonauts\"". This is the movie that could have made Wolfgang Petersen into a Steven Spielberg-esquire Director  a star of Eric Bana  a leading man of Orlando Bloom  brought Brad Pitt up to Tom Cruise's (figurative) height and left Diane Kruger as a potential superstar.Instead  this movie flopped. BADLY. Now the reasons can be either obvious or mystifying. I'm in the middle. As an action-adventure movie  I want big action type and kick-ass battle scenes. It has action and battle scenes  but they're disappointing. Really you would have expected so much more in the action scenes  it could have been so much better.It has good acting from Peter O'Toole  Brian Cox  Eric Bana and Sean Bean  Diane Kruger and Orlando Bloom do well  the most disappointing was Brad Pitt. In this movie he was supposed to be the hero and I thought he was a prat. Eric Bana  really  was supposed to be the villain and yet I preferred him to Brad \""Arm\""Pitt.It no longer had c Gods in it  which would have really tipped it over the edge. Instead Achilles was just a brilliant fighter. This movie was more steeped in realism  which gave it that extra edge.Watch it if you want  but prepared to be disappointed.\""In the year 1193 B.C.  Paris  a prince of Troy woos Helen  Queen of Sparta  away from her husband  Menelaus  setting the kingdoms of Mycenae Greece at war with Troy. The Greeks sail to Troy and lay siege. Achilles was the greatest hero among the Greeks  while Hector  the eldest son of Priam  King of Troy  embodied the hopes of the people of his city.\""\tMan this movie is so different from the original plot and it was bad.I mean it was very boring even trough the battle scenes i was yawning.And Pitt who is trying to be a David Beckham lookalike 's acting was poor.But the thing i disliked most was the story which had almost nothing to do with what Homer wrote or whit what happened .I expected something better from this movie but i left disappointed.Of course the effects and stunts were nice and that and Orlando Bloom 's performance are the only things a liked about this movie.If you want big battles with a lot of effects and really entertaining and tragic story watch \""Lord of The Rings\"" one more time.No this high budget Hollywood fiction \""based\"" on Homer's tragedy.\tThis script is an assassination of the Iliad  not an adaptation  and the only emotion remaining is horror that the story I held so dear as a child might have come to such an insipid and confused result. The other disappointing thing is that there are some genuinely good efforts wasted here - the special effects are really well done  and both Eric Bana and Sean Bean give good accounts of themselves in light of their material.Amongst the other performances  Peter O'Toole's presence as Priam only serves to remind us of what epics are capable when done well. Diane Kruger and Orlando Bloom are insipid  flat and downright annoying  and Brian Cox is one-dimensional  but their characters are written that way. They never had a chance. I almost forgot Brad Pitt as Achilles. His character is just that memorable.\tThe film is based predominantly on Homer's Iliad  although it takes cues from the Odyssey and Virgil's Aeneid. The screen play was written by David Benioff and falls amazingly short of its inspiration. The movie is full of sweeping changes from Homer's work. When one changes the work of a literary master  it would be hoped this would be for the better  to make a work more accessible to a general audience. In the case of Troy all it does is serve to confuse the issue and paint the Iliad as a love story  which most certainly was not.Let us start with the literary inaccuracies that run so rampant throughout the film. It opens up with King Agamemnon at Thessaly. Achilles is to fight Boagrius (a completed fabricated character) to settle control of the nation. In this half hazard introduction we learn Achilles is the son of Thetis  a goddess. This is close to the only mention of the gods  a major force in the Iliad  in the entirety of the film. From this addition the film skips to Paris taking Helen from Sparta. Paris and Hector are depicted as having a deep love of one another  but even this simple connection is not accurate. Hector was angered by the actions of Paris and felt him a coward unworthy of being a prince. He did not protect Helen for Paris  he defended Troy from the Greeks.Menelaus goes to Agamemnon for aid in retrieving Helen so he can \""kill her with his own two hands\"" when he retrieves her. This could not be further from the literary reality. In the Odyssey one learns Helen returns to Menelaus after the fall of Troy and continues on as the Queen of Sparta. Not only does Menelaus not wish to kill Helen  he himself does not die. Of course  this is little fact is over looked when Paris meets Menelaus on the field of battle. The conflict between the two is accurate  Paris did run away (although this is with the assistance of Aphrodite)  however Menelaus being killed by Hector is not. The very act of killing him would have been against the rules of engagement and are counter to the character of Hector.Achilles is shown as removing himself from the battle when Agamemnon takes Briseis away from him. This is accurate; this slight is the reason for the anger of Achilles in the Iliad. However  Briseis is not an acolyte of Apollo  nor the cousin of Hector. She was a wife claimed as a prize in early fighting that Agamemnon claims as his own when he is forced to give up his own prize to avert a plague brought on the Greeks by Apollo. Making Briseis a cousin to Hector only served to muddle the plot. It also failed to show her connection with Achilles or Patroclus.Patroclus is another character to suddenly find himself in a new family. He was never the cousin of Achilles; he was his dearest friend and comrade. He did manage to get himself killed  which was the turning point for Achilles rejoining the battle  but it was not an accident. Patroclus asked permission of Achilles to take his armor and lead the Myrmidons into battle. Achilles allowed his  even watching much of the battle from his ship. Hector knew he was fighting Patroclus and intended to kill him. After killing Patroclus  Hector shows his wife how to escape the city. This never happened. In fact  she ends up being sold as a concubine and Hector's son is thrown from the walls of Troy.In Troy  upon learning of the death of Patroclus  Achilles goes to the walls of the city and demands Hector come down and face him. In the poem Hector is caught outside of the walls of Troy because of his own hubris is not returning to the city in the face of his numerous victories. When Achilles kills Hector he does drag the body  but he does this for more than a day. It is the twelve days he spends defiling the body that prove to dehumanize him and show how far he has fallen. It is this fall that allows for the catharsis at the end of the Iliad between Priam and Achilles. This catharsis is hinted at in Troy  but is never fully reached. Priam is stripped of his courage when he comes to Achilles in the film. Rather than risking his life and coming with a ransom for the body of Hector he just shows up in the tent. The act of Achilles offering him food and protection is skipped over. It is the conversation with Priam about his own father that moves Achilles to return the body. The entire point of Priam and Achilles together is lost.Benioff obviously had a great love of the Trojans  if his portrayal of their characters versus that of the Greeks is any indication. He paints Agamemnon and Menelaus in a very bad light  gives Paris and Hector a great nobility and gives far too much screen time to Helen. Homer did a better job of remaining impartial and he was Greek.Given his liberties  it is unsurprising that during the funeral of Hector (the actual ending place of the Iliad) the Greeks build the \""Trojan Horse\"" to send in. This is drawn from the Aeneid  and even it did not describe a horse full of soldiers. The reality is this was most likely a siege engine used on the gates of Troy. Engines during this time could have been described as horse like. From this horse Achilles and other Greek soldiers pour out into the city. Achilles goes to save and dies dramatically in her arms after Paris shoots him (minus the aid of Apollo) through his ankle. Of course  this is after Briseis managed to kill Agamemnon (also not based in literary reality).\tWhat a great film it is really extraordinary this is the most fascinated film i had ever seen   good luck brad and do more films like this  you can do it   it is interesting that the life and the power of Achilles it stand in the heel . The subject is powerful influenced by the wars which they meet in antiquity. I liked how they playing the actors in film especially brad Pitt   Eric Bana   Orlando Bloom   Lucie Barat and Diane Kruger. I think they are the actors who can win the Oscar in the future because they are greatly talent and can to play in any others films does matter the role . Congratulation to the film group   the work that you do it is seen .\tTROY is one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time. Not only do I own TROY  but every time it is on satellite I watch it. And I mean every time. LOL! TROY has something for everyone. It has action for the guys and a love story for the ladies. Troy also consists of some of the best actors and actresses of today's movies. Brad Pitt  Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom are a few to mention. Not only are these actors extremely HOTT!!!  but these talented actors really helped to make this movie. I recommend this movie to everyone (except for small children  due to some of the graphics). But overall I rate TROY a 10!!! If you have not seen it yet  you need to go rent it a.s.a.p.\tI recently watched \""Troy\"" for a second time and realized just what a mediocre snooze fest it is. I hadn't been all that impressed with Troy after the first viewing  and this movie does not hold up well with repeated viewings.Like most period pieces these days  Troy at least is a good looking picture. The costumes  the landscapes  the ships  the palaces  etc are all very nice to look at. Brad Pitt is nice to look at as well  but his character Achilles is as dull as a doorknob. One just does not care about what "
Unleashed (2005),"First and foremost  this is merely my personal opinion  if your here to tell me how bad of a movie it is  save it. I don't care what you have to say  However bias it may sound  I just know a good movie when I see one.Not only was it the Best Jet li movie I have seen  I think it was one of my many favorite of many films that I have seen this year. With such great actors like Morgan Freeman and Bob Hoskins  and Jet li's acting has much improved as well. This movie combines some of my favorite genres from Kung-fu to drama  to action and perhaps even gore  this movie is rather violent. I think it was done so  as to convey the kind of violence that Danny inherited due to his evil master's example/ways. I think the story is perfectly believable  and it just keeps getting better  there isn't a dull moment from the jaw dropping fight scenes  some of jet li's best I think since Fist of Legend  and Once upon a time in china. To the growing relationships between danny and sam  to character and plot development. With a superb soundtrack  done by a great electronic band: Massive Attack. And beautiful cinematography. I have nothing more to say except it's the best movie I've seen all year  I suggest you go see it and enjoy it  as much as I did!\t...but let's face it  Danny the Dog is a WAY cooler title.In short  this is the best Luc Besson script put to film  ever. That's saying a lot  considering the man has come up with some pretty cool stories (e.g.  Leon  5th Element). The bad guy (Bob Hoskins) has his version of a human story  and each character in the film has his/her own persona. It's awesome. The dialog flows like real life  the human interaction flows like real life  but sadly the action flows not so real life.The bigger action sequences follow through like a fight by the numbers flick from the '80's  very reminiscent of early Van-Damme films. The bad guys line up one by one  waiting their turn to be taken out by Li. Alas  this NEVER bothered me with this film  for reasons being Jet Li still gets the crap beat out of him (several times)  and the whole fight-by-the-numbers is offset by some really cool camera work. You can feel the energy emitting out each sequence  even the really short ones. It's hard for an action flick to do that nowadays.The acting is top-notch  especially in Li's character. Given the fact that I hated his performance in \The One\"" (\""just like old times  eh  buddy?\"" ugh.)  it still didn't stop me from enjoying the crap outta that movie. With \""Danny the Dog\"" (\""Unleashed\"" in the States) I got a special treat...Jet Li pulled off a wonderful performance in being a torn little boy in a grown-up body  trying to accept that he is  in fact a \""dog\""  yet yearns to be human  even before his freedom. The fact is  he is raised like dog by his \""uncle\""  a role that Bob Hoskins tore into like a starving rabid animal. I know this term gets tossed around a lot  but I quite literally mean it when I say  Hoskins was born for this role  and I thoroughly enjoyed watching him as much as I liked watching Li.All in all  this is a fascinating action-drama  which I gave a 9 out of 10. I would have it at a 10  if the action sets weren't so by the books. Kudos to the film makers  this is a movie worth remembering.\tWell  for starters i haven't seen much of movies with Jet Li. But if this film is any inkling about what kind of actor he is  then he IS the best actor from Asia today. Even though it is for the great part of the movie just plain fighting. He delivers a role that moves  and the movie it self surpasses by good story.And with supporting cast  as Morgan Freeman and Bob Hoskins  this is one of 2005 years best movies. Its got a surface of violence  but a heart of good storyline and acting. This movie might just make grown men cry. For what it portrait in Jet Lis character  is a loss of feelings  an childlike behavior  and lack of knowledge that just reach out into your chest. This is a must see!\tThis film was a very pleasant surprise.It's certainly different from every other Jet Li film I've seen. He manages to play to his strengths - strong  silent and an utter nutter when it comes to a fight.The fight scenes are far more enjoyable than anything I've seen in a great long time  none of the INFURIATING and poorly cut fights that seem to have constituted almost all recent films (upto and including the wonderful Batman Begins).This film isn't just all slick fight scenes though  it manages to portray a rather captivating emotional yarn as well. It's not exactly a perfect or deep portrayal but it works well and is actually quite compelling.This film works and it works well and it is well worth watching.\tEver since Danny the Dog was announced  I have followed its production with much interest. The inclusion of such accomplished and respected actors; Bob Hoskins and Morgan Freeman  coupled with the promise of brutal fight choreography by Yuen Woo-ping had enhanced my anticipation. This anticipation recently began to turn into apprehension  as firstly the name was changed for some territories into \""Unleashed\""  presumably to make it more catchy and appealing to the American market. Secondly  the release of the film has been regularly delayed and is now available on region 3 DVD before it has even made it onto UK cinema screens. These are usually signs that the quality of the film is less than certain.Thankfully  I need not have worried. I have no problem in saying that this is easily Jet's finest English language film. It is also possibly his best modern day role  outdoing the likes of Hong Kong counterparts; \""My Father is a Hero\"" and \""High Risk\"". I still feel that Jet's greatest moments have been in period pieces such as \""Once Upon a Time in China\"" and \""Fong Sai Yuk\"" and this is likely to remain the case. However  here it shows that he can not only still produce a fine  grounded  physical performance  but he can actually hold his own on a purely dramatic level.As a story  Danny the Dog is more interesting than first imagined. I fully expected the plot line of Danny being a trained bodyguard  literally kept like a dog on a leash since childhood to be a transparent excuse to put fight scenes into a film. This is obviously partly true  but  whilst exploring the reasons for Danny's pseudo-imprisonment and his obvious trouble re-integrating socially  we get to see the emotional aspects of Jet's personality shine in a way so annoyingly restricted in his more recent films. Jet is an awesome physical performer  but there is so much more to his overall screen charisma that has helped make him an international star.It is probably true to say that most people who intend to see Li's films are as interested in the action sequences as they are in the characters. In this area  I have to admit to being slightly disappointed. My expectations were clearly sky-high after hearing that Yuen Woo-ping would be working with Jet again after almost a decade. Woo-ping is responsible for arguably Li's finest hour with \""Fist of Legend\"" so perhaps my expectations were a little unrealistic  however  the fights here are not up to the same standard. I have often felt that although Hong Kong choreographers can do great work on Western films  without the time afforded their Eastern counterparts  and the quality of the Chinese stunt performers they often pale in comparison. The same is true here  as although the choreography is neat  and the performers very able  nothing compares to the fearlessness  sublime fluidity and speed with which the Hong Kong stuntmen from the last 20 years are capable. Nevertheless  the action on show is brutal  bloody and often balletic.Jet's next feature is likely to be a Chinese production with Jet playing the legendary Fok Yun Gap. Hopefully  he will return to Hong Kong permanently  as with Danny the Dog I believe he has reached as high a note as he is likely to with the restrictions placed upon him by Western studios. At least now he can return proud in the knowledge that he has easily been the most successful Hong Kong export with a much higher quality level of output than even the likes of Jackie Chan or Chow Yun Fat.I heartily recommend Danny the Dog (or Unleashed depending on your location) to almost everyone \u0096 even those who are not fans of martial art films or Jet Li in particular  as this is a production that could stand on its own as a purely dramatic exercise. It is not without its faults  as some may feel it is a touch melodramatic or even a little too short  however  it is still a touching film which manages to show everything Jet has to offer from his likable  shy persona to his impressive physical grace.\tI went into this film with the prediction that this would prove Jet Li to have some true acting skill. I was not disappointed. Granted  Li will never win an Oscar for his acting (probably)  but in this movie he is given a character with such a depth that you rarely find in a martial arts film. Not having quite as many lines as he usually might  his portrayal of Danny was truly touching. The other actors--Freeman  Hoskins  Conden--are the real dramatic talent  yet Li holds his own quite well.Li's unique brand of martial arts combat in film has never been better in his American films. First  this is simply the most vicious that he has ever been. Still very stylized  but with a fierceness we have never before seen in him. That  and he doesn't use wires to do his moves (YAAAAAAYYYYYYYY!!!!!).Any Jet Li fan MUST see Unleashed. No options: it is a must!!\tAs a Louis Leterrier movie  i wasn't expecting much.You get the idea of how mediocre the director is when u see only the preview of \""The transporter\""...and the few other movies the fellow has made. The reason i watched the movie was for Jet li  who as usual has made a good performance in action.(but still have to work on acting..) and Thanks to Morgan Freeman  who brought his quality to such oh so poor movie. This is sad to say  but although Mr Leterrier studied film making in NY  this man sadly cannot tell a story  and Unleashed is full of inconsistency and awkwardness.(I wish i could advise him to return to school) About Luc Besson's credit on writing  there's no much quality about it neither. Nor any clue of cleverness.To resume: Mediocre story  mediocre actors (except for Mr Freeman)  mediocre director.\tFirst of I have to give Jet Li some respect for his performance in this movie. We all know that he can fight real good  but in this movie he actually does some acting. In a very funny and convincing manner he goes from a bloodthirsty beast to a cute \""puppy\"".The plot is that Danny's (Jet Li) mother gets killed by a man who is some kind of minor mafia boss when Danny is a small child. He then is raised and trained just like a dog by the same man that killed his mother. So  when Danny is all grown up he has do to all the dirty work  like beating people half to death.Well  one day Danny gets to see a little of the real world outside his cage without having to hurt someone at the same time. This changes his life forever... and so on.I have to say that even though Jet Li does a great performance in both martial arts and acting the movie feels a little bit overdone. There are aspects of the movie that feels to unreal and that makes the movie just a little bit crappy. For example  Morgan Freeman is supposed to play a blind man in this movie and even though he cant see he always looks at the person he talks to and moves his head just like someone that can see does. So that wasn't very convincing.Still  it is worth to see this one. One of Jet Li's better ones.\tnow i have watched quite a few li films  and yes even black mask.... i have got to say that this is even another level up from cradle to the grave.... i find that in this film the human aspect of li comes across a lot more  he isn't some super duper marshal arts master whos style will never be beaten.. in fact it is the sheer brutality of the fight scenes in this film which i found excellent  this is street fighting and does not look like it was contrived by a choreographer with set routines as li' character improvises his fighting and uses any means to beat his adversary and this is showcased best in the opening sequence... that is not to say that after the first fight scene nothing actually happens as this is not the case  we are introduced to li' and freemans characters and we come to care about them as people. i have got to say i think freeman is a very under appreciated actor but yet again as in all his films he makes u believe in his character. i thought hoskins played a great part as well even though some people do think that his lines were not very intellectual  i would say that his line are spot on for his character is supposed to have gone through life on the wrong side of the tracks  made himself into a successful  very brutal but almost naive gangster. the soppyness is not constant after the opening scenes as li' character goes back to hoskins ending up in an illegal fight club. he then goes back to freeman before hoskins comes after him which brings on the final fight scenes which last approx. 15-20 minutes... all in all worth a watch even if u r not a li fan\tSTAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Danny (Jet Li) is a man who has been raised from childhood to fight and maim like an animal. Once his electronic collar is removed by his 'owner' (Bob Hoskins) a vicious gangster into protection rackets  he goes berserk and unleashes a brutal tirade of martial arts violence. Then one day  he starts to discover his true self and begins to question his reason for being. Then his owner is apparently killed after biting off more than he could chew with a victim who really didn't want to pay up. Danny discovers Sam (Morgan Freeman) a kindly old Ray Charles alike who teaches him to play the piano  despite his debilitating blindness. He discovers a gentler side to his humanity and learns the true meaning of love and friendship. But all this can't last forever and in time  old and unwelcome faces from his past return to wreak havoc on his present peace and well-being...Unleashed has finally been released. I do remember that Steven Seagal had originally been billed to play Li's role- uggggh  no  no  a very bad choice- Li was perfect for the role. Although the day I thought I'd ever see him and Morgan Freeman in a film together would be a cold day in hell  but then he did make his Hollywood debut alongside Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon 4  so maybe this isn't so surprising. Hoskins  on the other hand  well  he should be grateful to be working with Li  not the other way round  that's all I'll say.Fans expecting more of Li's usual work will at best be surprised and at worst extremely disappointed with Unleashed. Although there is some appropriately brutal and intense MA sequences in parts  a larger part of the film is devoted to the drama segment between Li and Freeman and him becoming accustomed to his life beyond the control of his brutal owner. This drama is very well conveyed and certainly reels you in for the most part of the film. The MA scenes are actually a little disappointing. Although they're undeniably intense and ferocious  there's something about the chereography and timing that just feels a little flippant and a bit too choppy to be considered among Lis best work (although I will confess I haven't seen many of his foreign offerings.) Even the scene in which weapons  including axes and sharp rods  are used  although you feel the tension  you can't admire the craftsmanship. Li appears less bothered about his MA displays here and more concerned with coming across as a good actor (possibly awed to be working alongside an acting great like Freeman and trying to play up to and impress him.) This behaviour was certainly evident at the film's premiere...The film has an absorbing use of style and camera angles that should be commended  typical for a film involving french genius Luc Besson. On the other hand  weighing it down are some unexplained queries in the script that fail to make sense. Why does having the collar removed make Li react the way he does? How has he learned to use martial arts so effectively if he's just been grabbed at a young age and raised by people with no apparent training in them themselves? And why  when the film is set in Glasgow  does no one talk with a Scottish accent? But a large majority of fans of this type of film probably won't care about those questions  there is some enjoyably tense action to be enjoyed and it's also a film that opens new doors for Li in terms of his development as an 'actor' and not just a 'martial arts star.' ***\tI asked my little brother to come along with me to see this film  but his response was that he \""didn't want to see a movie in which Jet Li beats people up as rap music plays.\"" Smart boy. But Unleashed is an effective and highly entertaining action film. Unlike those Jet Li films my little bro dissed  Unleashed gives context and resonance to its action sequences by wrapping them around a pitiful  tragic and endearing central character who's all too likable and making the action grow out of the story rather than the other way around. When the Jet Li character is thrused back into his animalistic world after experiencing the joys of family & love  we genuinely fear for him and hate the villain  a nasty  ferocious Bob Hoskins who through out looks to be having fun in the role. A typical action movie would've done away or replaced the second act in the film in which Danny is taken in by Morgan Freeman and his stepdaughter  but Unleashed is all the more special in making you interested and care about characters who don't so much as pick a gun. It is the unusual action film that has emotions at its heart rather than petty indulgence in violence. Towards the end  Danny doesn't want to hurt people  and we cheer.\tJet Li shows here just why he is the No 1 action star at the moment. Here he is up against some of the world's finest actors (Bob Hoskins  who plays menace so well for someone of his stature  and Morgan Freeman - possibly the finest living actor on the planet) and holds his own. He shows that not only is he the premier screen martial artist  but that he can also act. He has a very natural style immerses himself in the role he is playing.Some of the action set-pieces are monumental and having recently watched a documentary about the Shaolin  I managed to 'spot' a number of moves used during their training sessions  no surprise there as Jet came from a Shaolin Temple (well  according to this documentary!) From the pen of Luc Besson  this could be nothing more than a modern masterpiece.I am really looking forward to Jet's next outing - let's hope it's not a rom-com!\tI was totally misled in believing that this little flick was a martial art movie with something more to it. Unlike movies from Stephan Chow like Gong fu and Shaolin Soccer and Oldboy by Chan-wook Park  where the fine martial art is combined with a deeper storyline  the storyline in Danny the Dog AKA Unleashed stinks.Morgan Freeman in the role of Sam the blind piano player and his step daughter Victoria played by Kerry Condon take this movie down to the level of an evangelist moral play. Although Jet Li and Bob Hoskins both do make a good performance  the scenes where Victoria tries to emotionally unleash the mentally retarded Jet Li made my toes curl.I do not want to waste more on this movie. If you wish to see a good martial art movie with a good storyline go see Oldboy or one of Stephan Chow's movies.\tI know I said I would review this  and so I finally have. This movie was amazing. I went in thinking that it was going to be another Jet Li movie with a little bit of storyline to be a vehicle for the massive fight scenes. But instead  it turned out that this movie had a lot of heart. This is a story about Danny (Jet Li)  who has been brought up from a very young age for the soul purpose of fighting. He does not know anything else. He only knows how to defend himself and use his body to kill others. But what happens when a nice older gentleman named Sam (Morgan Freeman) lets him find his own personality and dreams? That is the basic premise of the movie. I figured that Jet Li was simply a fighter  but as it turns out  he can actually act. We aren't talking Oscar caliber performance here or anything  but he still impressed me quite a bit. He can still fight  and fight well. The scenes where he was fighting others were that much more amazing by the fact that there weren't a slew of them like in previous films. I should have known that since Morgan Freeman was in it  that it wasn't just an action movie  but something with a personality and a purpose. He is truly the embodiment of the father figure in movies these days. Or perhaps maybe even the grandfather. He has played God (Bruce Almighty)  the President (Deep Impact)  and in his older age has gone more to the grandfather role of a one eyed janitor (MIllion Dollar Baby)  and now plays a blind piano teacher in Unleashed. He is an amazing actor and does not disappoint in this  or any of his movies. From time to time  the storyline  or his character may be less than perfect  but his acting is always flawless. These are really the two main actors in this movie. Although Bob Hoskins  (Enemy at the Gates  Super Mario Brothers) has a sizable role as well as Danny's caretaker during his fighting days. He does a good job and makes you truly have something against him by the end of the movie. I wanted so badly for something terrible to happen to his character. Which is what his character was written for as the villain. There is also a girl named Victoria  who is Morgan Freeman's character's best friend's daughter. Did you get that? Yeah  i'm confused now too. She is played by Kerry Condon who I had never heard of before. To be an unknown  I was impressed. She played the little girl part quite well. But her character got on my nerves after awhile. That could have been the acting  but I believe it was written that way. All in all  this movie was amazing. I really don't have any negative criticisms of it because it blindsided me and took me by surprise as it was not what I was expecting. If you enjoy martial arts movies with a good storyline  I believe you will enjoy this movie. I would say that this movie gets 8 out of 10 stars. Go see it.\tDanny the Dog (US title: Unleashed) has good fighting scenes in it as you'd expect from a Jet Li movie and it also features some compelling acting from Mr. Li. The only major gripe I have with it is the concept of human experiment which it features as it's premise (\""Get them young and the possibilities are infinite\""). Put a collar around an infant and raise him to behave like a dog? Realistically speaking the movie has no merit on this level and bluntly asks us to accept the fact that Danny is a grown up \""dog\"" with the mind of a traumatized child. The collar comes off and the \""unleashed\"" dog becomes a martial arts killer machine.What's more is that Bob Hoskins as Bart just doesn't strike me as the utter despicable human monster he is supposed to resemble. We are presented with cardboard \""fairy tale\"" characters and when we look to the story we find just another rip off of clich\u00e9s. The story has no dignity to it and is simply without merit  it isn't even that scurrile that you'd be able to accept it for that alone (like in \""The Favour  the Watch and the Very Big Fish\""). The only \""spice\"" that is added is the martial arts which detaches us from the \""transformation\"" plot and yet (since we all love fairy tales with happy endings) we still hope Danny can make his transformation back into the child he was and become the man he is supposed to be.If I had to categorize this movie I would file it under Action  Drama  Fantasy. Why the latter? Because once upon a time evil man kills woman  takes infant  infant is raised by evil \""uncle\"" man in evil dungeon to become evil killer dog  sweet music brings back \""womb\"" memories and \""unleashes\"" the human aspect inside the child dog man  love is sweet  love is good and former dog child kicks evil uncle in the nuts and quits and all live happily ever after.Jet Li delivers good acting and superb martial arts action and if you can forgive all the other short comings then you will like it all the more. I can't help to think that this movie could have done way better with a different director. French cinema is dead anyhow  according to the French critics. 6/10\tDid you like Oldboy? The Bourne films? Fight Club? Leon? If your answers include \""No\""  you have no place discussing films on the internet. Go back to the Hallmark channel immediately and never return.If your answers include \""I haven't seen it\""  rectify the situation forthwith. IMDb will be here when you are ready to return.If your answers are \""Yes  Yes  Yes and good golly Yes again!\""  prepare yourself for another film that reaches the cinematic standard of these stylish masterpieces.Unleashed (as I saw it) starts with gangster Bob and the boys collecting their protection money  with Jet Li (Danny the Dog) trailed around on his leash as a threat  much as you might with a Dobermann or Pit Bull terrier. Those who don't pay get seven shades of ..something beaten out of their bloody  broken corpses. This is not the purity of Wu Shu Kung Fu  oh no  this is martial arts crossed with no-holds-barred pub fighting: heads smashed  limbs snapped  furniture broken  noses broken  and a great deal of hair removal by fingers alone. Pay up  or pay now and then pay up.Stuff happens (I'm not going to ruin it)  and Danny finds himself alone and taken under the wing of blind piano tuner Morgan Freeman (playing 'Morgan Freeman' on full wisdom & shmaltz settings). By and by  Danny (who's been raised - and badly treated - like a dog) begins to be rehabilitated and discovers the small joys life can bring. ACTION FANS: this is not a bad thing. Jet Li somehow manages to stay the right side of 'cute'  Morgan Freeman manages to express waryness as well as a warm welcome  and thanks to superb sound and directing we get one of the most tense moments I've ever seen in any film. I was literally holding my breath  totally tensed up  and thinking \""God no! Don't do that!!!\"". Beware if this Director ever decides to do Horror - it could be so scary he'll have the audience carried out on stretchers & oxygen.Anyway  Danny's past catches up with him. It always does  usually about two-thirds of the way through a film. And then we're back to some more serious violence  followed by a brief pause before even more serious violence  a 'boss battle' which reminded me of the albino twins in Kiss of the Dragon  and the inevitable confrontation at the end. There's some back-story flashbacks & revelations thrown in too  but not so much as to be annoying. Then the film is over  you walk out of the cinema  and text the mate who couldn't join you to tell him he missed an INCREDIBLE film  ha ha  and I'll see it again if you want to go.Special mention for Jet Li - a tour de force  not just in the action scenes but also for his portrayal of a man who has basically been brutalised from a very young age  and is even scared of himself.Special mention for Bob Hoskins - who I've not really rated before  but here he manages to flesh out a very convincing  reprehensible character. Great dialogue gives him a verbal dexterity we don't usually see in our cardboard-cutout villains  as well as a definite emotional connection to Danny (twisted though it is). We're clearly supposed to see him as one of those dog owners who treats his dog very badly  but still cares for it in his own sick way.Special mention for the director & editor - for fabulous fight scenes  with LONG CUTS so we can actually see Jet Li's skill and Yuen Wo Ping's choreography. Also for maintaining pace and interest through the middle where most filmmakers would die on their butts. Also for creating AMAZING tension (because YES  in real life if you try to rehabilitate/domesticate a wild animal there's always the threat that it could flip out and kill you without meaning to). Also for perhaps the only film I've ever seen with A) car crashes that don't end in ridiculous explosions and B) characters that survive car crashes AND show signs of injuries! Where is this crazy wave of realism going to end!? We'll have characters remembering to eat  sleep and go to the toilet next..I can only think of two minor criticisms: 1) The middle of the film takes place over a few (or several) months - but you don't get much of a sense of time passing. Like it says in Team America  maybe we needed a montage (\""montage  yeah!\""). 2) There's quite a big plot point that goes completely unresolved. I can't explain too much  but essentially I believe a significant 'payback' scene is missing from the final third. The main story doesn't need it  but I would like to have seen what happened.Unleashed / Danny the Dog - whatever it's called  go see it. It's fab.\tThe best movie of 2005 by a long shot! This is not just a karate movie (though plenty of that is included). This is arguably the best script ever written in a good versus evil plot. I made the mistake of seeing Revenge of the Sith on the same day and it paled in comparison! Jet Li deserves an Oscar nomination as does the script writer.Li portrays a trained killer (Danny the Dog) who goes off on anyone around him when his dog-collar is removed. But he also has a primal innocence and naivet\u00e9 that becomes evident when he believes that his master (the ever evil Bob Hoskins) has been gunned down and so he follows home a blind piano tuner (the ever Godlike Morgan Freeman) and ultimately has to decide between killing and loving. (Don't we all) I laughed. I cried. There was suspense and two hours later I felt like a better person for having seen this film. See it in a theater if you are able!\tSaw this movie in a cinema. Worth watching but leaves the audience a bit confused about what kind of a movie it should be. The story is about a man kept as a dog and unleashed like a fighting dog. A money lender/ gangster uses him to frighten and fight people when collecting his debts... Good movie but not great. The movie actually combines Karate and Drama and a bit of music. Not very typical and not my favorite genre..if there is one like this. The two types of films don't combine that well together especially when the 'sound of music' is thrown in as well... Danny the Dog contains good karate scenes and also some emotionally moving scenes. Good acting all around by Morgan Freeman and others. Still I would not give it more than a 6 out of 10. I prefer comedy and karate or thriller and karate to this weird combination.\tThose expecting a all out fight movie"
War of the Worlds (2005),"This movie was really good! I would see it a million times. I cant wait until it comes out on DVD. I need copy of it. Someone told me it would be coming out in December...its July now. Anyway  the reason i love the movie so much is because of Robbie (Justin Chatwin). He is THE hottest person that ever walked this planet!!!! So many people think that he is really hot too. I think that without his long hair he would not be as hot. So if Justin Chatwin ever reads this...keep your long hair!I know he wont ever read this but that would be good if he does. I love him SO much. Anyway the rest of the movie  i think  was really cool.Dakota Fanning is such a good actress! This is my new favorite movie. Luv ya Justin Chatwin!\tSpielberg said this film is based on the H.G. Wells novel  but it just comes out looking like a cheap sequel to Independence Day. While the script was changed to take place in modern times it took away the raw chemistry of the book. As far as casting goes  Tom Cruise gives his regular pretty boy saves the world performance. Besides the silly special affects and the strained script  the best part of this SCFI blockbuster is Dakota Fanning. Fanning who's only 11 years old upstages the great Tom Cruise with little trouble.But with this in mind  Spielberg still manages to keep the audience's attention like he's always managed to do. Overall \War of the Worlds\"" may top $200 million  but that still doesn't make it an instant classic.\tSteven Spielberg's third 'from out of this world' opus is just one big mess. It's difficult to understand how the man who gave us the charm of E.T. and the humanity of Close Encounters could deliver such pathetic junk. The biggest problem in this film is a script so lacking in coherency that it's writing seems better suited to one of those bad 50's B sci-fi movies. (I think I just heard H. G. Wells roll around in his grave for the umpteenth time.)The other big problem is the lack of empathy one feels for the characters. Cruise's daughter is so annoying I almost wished one of the tripods would put that screeching presence out of her misery. And what's with Tim Robbins? His hammy performance was the only true bit of humor to be found anywhere.Granted  the special effects are great and one should not expect any big statement on the human condition from big budget sci-fi  but we're talking Spielberg here. One anticipates not only a good show but a superior narrative from a good storyteller. On the positive side  the director goes for a much grittier look (a la Saving Private Ryan) which is appropriate for the subject matter. However  maybe the movie would have worked better had it expanded the story to involve more characters and encompassed more the broader effect of the invasion outside of Cruise's family.All in all  a total waste of talent and an even clunkier mess than the marauding invading aliens.\tI saw this movie multiple times. I was very impressed with the special effects and the tripods. Dakota Fanning really brought this movie to life. She did wonderfully as a young actress. She really made you beileve all her emotions were real. And I was very impressed.However  I did not give this movie a ten  because there are many details they overlooked. Apparently they didn't think that there were so many people out there that payed attention to detail. After the storm  I thought the power went out? Then soon after random citizens were filming things on video cameras  and shooting pictures. How on earth did there stuff start working so fast? When they were at the house where the airplane wreckage was  you're telling me that the storm was strong enough to tear the roof off of an airplane  but the car didn't get a dent on it? When they arrive in Boston  why are they all so clean? There was many tripods just minutes before in the movie  so why was everything there perfectly in order? Boston is considered a main city in our country  there should have been more damage. They also really screwed up at the very end. What the heck are they talking about? How did the smallest particles destroy them? It didn't really clearly say what took the tripods down.\tThey've messed with H.G. Wells  and have thus messed with the best. I  for one  am incredibly surprised Spielberg signed on to a project with this many continuity errors.1) The EMP knocks out every electronic device  from car ignitions to watches  yet a bystander is recording it all ON VIDEO CAMERA! Also  the sink works when Ray washes all the people dust off of him? Hmm  water pumps and the mainframe for the water system would be COMPUTERIZED. And when he and Rachel finally arrive in Boston  the city lays in ruins  yet his ex-wife and her parents have had showers recently? 2) These aliens are advanced enough to bury machines ahead of 21st century technology millions of years ago  but can't rely on anything more than a camera to find people? No biosensors? C'mon! 3) There are United States soldiers in the basket thingies under the machines. One of the primary objectives for American POWs is to attempt escape. These men are sent up fully armed  yet it takes a dock worker to realize that grenades can go up that anus thing?The special effects are quite good  as is the editing. It's a toss-up: pay the $9 to see the FX on a big screen  or wait until it's on DVD. Either way  the errors will bug you.\tBoth Cruise and Spielberg are big fans of the old film  and it shows. The only trace of the actual book that has overtaken their determination to tribute it's first movie incarnation is the change of the Martian machines from flying lampshade type things to actual tripods. Other then that the entire film is just an attempt to put a marginally different perspective on the 50's version.To be fair  it does start out well (and there are some good cinematic moments throughout). Some claim it continues well for about 2/3rds of the film  but I think in truth it is only the first 3rd that works at all. It doesn't take long for clich\u00e9s and overly predictable plot elements to creep in and there is nothing daring or risky about anything attempted by Spielberg after about 20 minutes in. It's all very well for people to go on about the focus on the main Character. But I don't think that is particularly groundbreaking. There are a good number of other directors I think can bring off a personal perspective much better so I don't think Spielberg is even playing to his strengths on this one.Plus  when you have an astronomical budget  one major star and material a good 80% of the audience will already know pretty well (anyone not know how it was going to end?)  it pretty much goes without saying that people are going to want to see a lot more of the invading martians. It's all very well to point to the rules of good horror and claim not seeing stuff is suspenseful but is it entirely appropriate for this particular film? I would say not. If Spielberg wanted to do a film like that  why not come up with something fresh rather then doing a remake of a well known film based on a well known book. When you already know what is going on  there is nothing gained by not showing it.The film didn't need to worry about action clich\u00e9s as in actual fact this film should never have been an action film. Humanity can't defend against these invaders  so why show anything but futility. Perhaps because that wouldn't be very Hollywood  and for all the good intentions of the film it descended into pretty standard action by the end anyway.What I would have liked to have seen would have been more dramatic spectacles  barren landscapes  shocking scenes of destruction  etc. More of the martians and perhaps show how the governments totally failed to stop them with everything they tried. They actually achieved that in the 40's film  so one of the things Spielberg did leave out was the one aspect that really gave the \""not killed by man\"" aspect. As a result the very end leaves you cold  and as a big slap in the face to the book they include a voice over copied directly from the 50's film putting everything in a religious point of view (the one thing that really let down the 40's film). The book was to a large extent very anti-religious and there was no need to ignore that very important aspect of the original story. It's not even comfortably put on the end  because with the (totally unnecessary) heroic triumphs achieved by Cruise minutes early it seems like we've suddenly cut to the end of a different film.Perhaps the influence of the 50's film was too much for him. After all  anyone ever notice how similar ET looks to the aliens in the 50's film? If you were to take those aliens and make them cute  you'd end up with ET. Certainly not a co-incidence. This is very much Spielberg remaking what must have been his favourite film.One thing with Spielberg I always found annoying is his obsession with getting certificates that let kids see the film. For a start no other director could release films like this and like Jurassic park (where someones arm is ripped off his body) and get such family orientated ratings. But even with his ability to manipulate censors  he still has to hold back from making what the film should have been just for the sake of letting the kiddies see it. I guess at the end of the day it's all about money and ego and not just about making a really good film.So there you go. I gave this a disappointing 4 out of 10. It had a lot of potential but there are so many flaws and so many mixed up ideas that are never fully realised I just couldn't give it a good score. I couldn't even give it an average score  because with Spielberg  Cruise and the special effects budget I have to compare it to what I think should have been possible with the money spent and talent involved. This film is one of the great underachiever of the modern day. Compare that to the 50's film  which for the time period had stunning effects  a compelling plot and flaws that were all to understandable given the time of filming. It way ahead of it's time and is still a reasonable watch even five decades later. Can anyone honestly say this will last so well?\tThe only reason that I give this film any stars at all is that the special effects are great. The action  the aliens  the tripods  all look real. Nothing was cartoonish or fakish. However  a movie can't be saved by its looks. Tom Cruise plays  for once  not Tom Cruise. Instead he plays a boorish and unintelligent Tom Cruise. No panache  no style. Not enough attention is payed to Miranda Otto  who was so riveting in \""The Two Towers\"" and \""The Return of the King\"". The kids are irritation personified. It's as if Spielberg wanted to show the world how an invasion affected a stereotype of the common family. If this is the common family  we're in trouble. A father who doesn't deliver the necessary skills to his children  or give them expectations to achieve; kids who don't pay attention to authority figures; a crazy Tim Robbins whose character's actions  and final outcome  are pointless to moving us through the story. There wasn't enough horror in this flick. Here we have a filmmaker who has redefined what can be done with film  i.e \""Jaws\"" and \""Schindler's List\""  who has a chance to do it yet again with a classic story of alien invasion  to truly scare us and make us think  and instead  we get tripe. No spoiling here unless I'm not opaque enough  but there is such a cop out  a deus ex machina  in the end of the movie that my impression was that Spielberg mistakenly assumed that the movie was horrific enough for the viewer to that point. I thought \""The War of the Worlds\"" was too long and focused on people we can't really care about because their characters were developed in the wrong directions.\tI was watching a Spielberg movies and yet   in the very same time  was longing to watch a real Spielberg movie. As other comments mentioned  one cannot really believe this is the director who gave us the second  third and fourth degree encounter movies; or Minority Report; or even ET... something is lacking. In fact  so many things are lacking !!! the Spielberg vision. The Spielberg \""hand\"". All what was left from his previous movies is the blond-haired misunderstood child who now becomes hysteric and overreacts. A good script. A story well put together. you can name the rest  the list is open. Instead  we have Tom Cruise displaying his usual acting style: running  screaming  and playing the hero for two hours which seem never-ending.... What a pity  Tom !!! what a difference compared to your performance in Minority Report   or Magnolia  or Collateral....you were really acting in these movies....what happened now ? I did not expect to see extraordinary special effects. we have seen to many of these already. But this movie is even worse than Independence Day. That one at least had some humour. Sadly  War of the Worlds is a huge disappointment. Hollywood  please  no more alien invasions  no more dinosaurs  no more sword-and-sandal epics  no more Delta Force actions  no more disasters and tragedies(we see too many of them on CNN and Real TV  thank you very much). How about some real movies ? about real people  real life  real small-time everyday average lives of ordinary people? like the good old movies of the '80s and '90s ?\tWar of the worlds is one of my favorite movie. This movies really good. I think this movie will get Oscar for best movie of the year. And best director and best producer of the year. And also might get best actor of the year!!! because Tom Cruises acting was awesome. And Steven Spielberg has done a great job.I would be very happy if Steven Spielberg makes another movie called \""War of the Worlds 2\"". I cant wait to see the next movie of Steven Spielberg's another adventure and action movie which is \""Jurassic Park 4\"". People should vote 10 for this movie!! People should go to the movie theater and watch this movie! I want to watch it again and!\tI will star by saying that i have not seen the original  heard the CD or read the book so i may be out of my depth commenting on this  on the other hand i can take an unbiased view. The previous Spielberg/Cruise picture Minority Report  while unsuccessful in the box office was a solid film with a good story and great effects. This one however was aimed at a much bigger audience  being based on such a famous novel. Basing films on famous books is a brave move and often it backfires as u have to pay more attention to detail to keep the fan boys happy  however i didn't know the story so went into this with an open mind trying not to be influenced by the critics.The first hour of this film went really well  it sucked you in to the plight of Cruise and his Kids on there mission to get away from the awe inspiring Tripods  the effects were brilliant the acting solid and the pace of the film relentless  although there were a few mistakes involving EMP(you'll know what i mean if you watch it)  i found myself getting involved with the film  Spielberg is a master at this. However the second half is not so good  packed with schmaltz galore and the pointlessness of Tim Robbins character  combined with a completely flat ending made the first half a waste of time building up to a massive disappointment.Maybe instead of a remake  a film based around aliens invading the earth  with which war of the worlds was an obvious template and paying respects to the original would have sufficed.\tI have to say that this movie wasn't all it was said to have been. There was not enough action; the action doesn't include every every single scene in the movie  despite the intro  being aliens attacking humans and killing them and the humans seem helpless to prevent it. You have the big scene in the beginning where the first aliens arrive  and that is how the movie should have been situated. After that there should have been a solution to how to stop the invaders. It didn't even live up to the name of War of the Worlds. This whole thing was one sided. It was very entertaining  I'll grant that  but for a Spielberg movie  I was a little disappointed. In my opinion  Independence Day is beat WOTW by a long shot. Cruise was decent  Fanning was superb  and Robbins gave a nice side effect. All in all  I gave it a six out of ten.\tMy wife and enjoyed the film. I didn't care so much about the EMP nits  but as we approach oil scarcity  I'm disturbed by the message that we must do ugly things to each other to survive. Ray isn't a bad guy  and he has his talents  but he survives by his ability to focus strictly on the survival of himself and his family. So he steals a car  probably the only working car in the vicinity  to escape. I might have done the same  but as they drove by all those people milling around their stopped cars  I was thinking  \""At least tell them to take cover!\"" I had read about the situation with Ogilvy  but my wife also had a bad feeling as soon as they ducked into the cellar. So we waited for the confrontation. Spielberg didn't let Ray kill Olgilvy in fury or the heat of immediate threat  but with a certain premeditation  as in  \""This guy's gotta go before he does anything else to jeopardize my daughter.\"" I suppose what bothers me is that people are already all too willing to lie  cheat and steal to prosper in a civilized situation. Aliens I can deal with  but it is truly scary to countenance a world with no rules at all.\tRay Ferrier is a New Jersey man working on the docks  living alone  separated from his ex-wife and two children. Rachel and Robbie come to stay with him for the usual few days and none of them are particularly happy to see one another. However their visit is livened up by an intense electromagnetic storm that is powerful  exhilarating and exciting. What nobody could have known though is that the storms are only cover for an invasion of an alien species  after all  the chances must be a million to one of such an event. As the alien craft rise out of the ground and begin cutting an unstoppable swath across the world  Ray takes his children and flees the city \u0096 not sure where he is going but just hoping to survive long enough to work something out.With the names involved in this film you could be forgiven for expecting something more than just a blockbuster film and  in some ways you'd be right but then in almost as many ways you'd be wrong. In many ways this is better than a normal effects blockbuster  but mainly this is down to the fact that  since 9/11  few studios want to launch a massive film that takes pleasure in death and destruction in the way that Independence Day did. Instead this is much darker and more effective for it \u0096 scarier and tension than if it had been made with just spectacle in mind. It still delivers the goods in that regards but the effects are used well  producing scenes of destruction as well as a particularly impressive scene where the camera moves around a moving car in a way that would be impossible without computers.The downbeat and dark presentation suggested that there is more to this film that effects and I was tempted to look into the subtext as I watched it. Here I didn't find much of interest and perhaps I was trying to see things that weren't there. With the obvious awareness of real events and emotions  the film seems to promote \""everyman for himself\""  sacrificial heroics and other strange meanings that the film can't do anything with. Maybe I was expecting too much and really there wasn't anything below the surface but if there was then it didn't make a great deal of sense. Ignoring this aspect though  the film still works well enough as a dark \""alien invasion\"" film that entertains and thrills without letting the audience actually revel in or remain remote from the death and destruction.Spielberg keeps it moving well and gives the film an convincing feel; darkness and light are used well and the locations are good  certainly making for a nice change from us watching the usual landmarks being destroyed \u0096 his focus is more on the people and real communities. For most of the film he manages to avoid the mawkish sentimentality that invades many of his films but he gives it up right at the end; the final few minutes had me walking out of the cinema shaking my head. I'm not referring to the bacteria ending (everyone knew that was coming) but to the terrible family reunion scene that is so horribly corny and cheesy that it turned my stomach. Did we need it? It smelt like a tacked on ending from a test screening but part of me knows that Spielberg is probably as guilty as anyone. For such a dark and destructive film it was a terrible ending and the previous 110 minutes deserved much better.Cruise is pretty good but he is far from being the ordinary working Joe that the script asks him to be. He can do the action stuff well and he is well practiced in acting alongside special effects but he is not a New Jersey shoreman! Fanning is as good as ever  convincing in her emotions but again perhaps a bit too precious to be a \""real\"" child. Chatwin is OK as Robbie but his character made very little sense to me and he didn't seem to understand what significance he played either. The support cast are mostly screaming extras; Robbins is quite good but Robinson and Barry's cameos are minimised by the fact that they are involved in that terrible  terrible ending. As with all blockbusters  the effects are the stars and they are worthy of the billing.Overall this is a good summer film that has a post-9/11 darkness and tone to it that some might find not quite conducive to enjoying the bangs that the summer audience usually want. However I quite liked this approach and found it more engaging and impacting. The effects are good and the performances fit in with them well but be warned \u0096 the cloying sentimentality of the last few minutes is really hard to stomach and will leave you with a really bad aftertaste.\tI saw War of the Worlds at my local drive in theater about the middle of July. The 2 things that I liked the most about WOTW is the sound and the special effects. First of all the sound. WOW! When the tripods make that low pitched rumble. One word. Amazing! Now the special effects. They were incredible! Those tripods were amazing machines! How tall were they? 300 feet maybe? Anyways this movie was great. Oh hands down to Spielberg and Tom Cruise for a truly amazing movie. Speaking of Tom Cruise  he was amazing in WOTW. Really good acting. Well done. I will definitely make sure I see the old WOTW soon because I want to see which is better. But I'm sure it'll be this one. I don't know why but i'll see.10/10\tThis movie proves how important a good story really is... The acting was great (Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning did a great job there)  the special effects were great (realistic all the way)  the filming was great and there were some good ideas in it  yet i was not the least bit satisfied by this movie... I feel like i have been waiting for 2 hours for something to really happen... This movie had a lot of potential and in my opinion it hasn't been used. I was also disappointed in the ending  where in the last minute you get some vague explanation of why it all happened leaving you with a lot of questions... (how did Robbie survive??)\tWar of the Worlds was an enjoyable film. Its very entertaining and keeps you involved throughout the entire movie. The ending was not the best. There were many holes in the story. If you watch the film  its awesome. But if you sit and think about what is going on through the movie and listen to the story  there are far too many holes. Personally  Spielberg did a good job  but I expected more from him. Go see it for yourself and find out. But when you see it  pay close attention to the things that are said in the beginning and see if they truly play out to add or take away from the actual film. I think the early narrating says some things that are left false by the end of the movie.\tWith all the remakes that are taking place in Hollywood you would think that a great filmmaker like Steven Spielberg would either be too busy for remakes or at least add something special to familiar material but this latest effort comes off (at best) as passable summer fare. This updated H.G. Wells story starts out with a divorced crane operator named Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) who has his children for the weekend while their mother Mary Ann (Miranda Otto) heads to Boston to see her grandparents.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Ray's children are Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and they naturally have a problem being with their immature father but all that changes with what appears to be the start of a lightening storm and lightening hitting key areas on the ground. To everyone's shock alien spacecraft has been buried underground for an unknown amount of time and now they've come to the surface and started to disintegrate everyone (and everything) in their path! Ray and his kids head out of town in what may be the only working car (for the time being) and soon figure out that the planet Earth is under attack. Ray is trying to head to Boston to find his ex-wife but along the way he loses the car to rioters and also meets a strange survivalist named Harlan Ogilvy (Tim Robbins) who ends up being more of a threat than actual help.Spielberg grew up in the 1950's and like many others has fond memories of not only the numerous sci-fi movies that were made but of the \""scare\"" films involving \""duck and cover\"" that young students were forced to view. Spielberg uses many elements of both the original film and Wells own story in the script such as the look of the tripod ships and the red weed. Like many other of his efforts Spielberg incorporates the theme of a troubled home into the story and when Cruise isn't trying to stay alive from an alien invasion he's desperately attempting to keep some sort of semblance of a family unit together. For the most part I was entertained by what I viewed on screen and both Cruise and Fanning give pretty good performances but I have to be honest and say that I wasn't overwhelmed by anything I saw. There were a few things that irked me (to some degree) and the first has to do with what the aliens intentions are concerning humans. They disintegrate people but they also use them for their blood...can't they make up their alien minds on what they want us for? Before I even went to the theater I instinctively knew I would be disappointed by the appearance of the actual aliens and I was but I did feel a chill whenever the giant tripods made that mechanical bellowing sound. I also had to laugh when I saw how much terror and trauma Cruise's character goes through in this film because regardless of what he has been saying in the media about prescription drugs and psychiatry I thought his character definitely needed to be put on anti-depressants and to see a good shrink! Fanning's character looks so shaken that I expect her to spend the rest of her life in a rubber room in the hospital sucking her thumb in the fetal position. But jokes aside  this is an entertaining effort that hits enough good notes to give it a recommendation and though it's more in line with \""Independence Day\"" than something classic like \""Close Encounters of the Third Kind\"" this is still (generally) a fun film to view.\tThe past week  I've read in many places (not even sure where at this point) negative opinions on this film focusing on unimportant details  like whether the force fields the aliens use were incorrectly off or on at crucial moments. Or that they're tired of Morgan Freeman's voice as God (he's not God; he speaks of God and could just be a survivor recalling this event years later; and now we're discussing this detail and missing the big picture). I get the feeling some viewers cheat themselves of a strong movie experience by looking for stuff like this throughout a film. The feeling Spielberg conveys in the first few minutes is that this really is just another typical day  as seen from the perspective of Tom Cruise's character and his kids (where it will remain for the entire film). There's nothing ominous in the air (even the TV blips of strange weather project nothing bad). It's a day like last week and it will end as just another day. There's that sameness to everything which all of the audience can relate to. Day after day  week after week  even year after year - nothing to really get excited about.When it shifts  it's a jolt. It starts with that weird lightning  pauses for a few minutes to build more tension  and then escalates to Hell on Earth within a few more. If one were to describe one of those alien tripod machines moving past a couple of blocks away  blasting with it's death beam  it would probably elicit a laugh from listeners  but there's nothing funny about how it's depicted  to Spielberg's credit; he'd learned his craft in this regard by the time of Saving Private Ryan's beach scene. When Cruise peers around the corner  a small  almost mouse-like figure  a lucky survivor of the initial onslaught  all you feel is his fear  his shock  his helplessness. The tripods even produce a bizarre musical sound  a deadly counterpoint to the notes we heard in \""Close Encounters\"" produced by Spielberg's friendly aliens; here  the aliens are sounding the death-knell of the human race. I must confess I'm not sure this intensity will come across so well on a small TV screen; I saw this in a theater and they turn up the sound so high  a person walking to his car across the screen is intense.So you're with Cruise and his kids the rest of the film; all your neighbors are dead; your other relatives in other cities? Maybe. You don't know. Any minute now  you may be joining the hundreds dead. No  must be thousands. Millions? No  it's too insane  too dreadful! The first act  ending with Cruise walking back to his house  numb and covered in the dust of people  and then managing to escape in the only working vehicle  is the best sequence; Spielberg can't really top it. But  the next few scenes all come pretty close in a series of heart-stoppers. The one extended scene where Spielberg  Cruise  the writer and all the participants were at a loss was being holed up with Tim Robbins; it just didn't work and slowed the picture down. And the ending? The undoing of the aliens followed along the same lines of the original climax of H.G.Wells' novel and the '53 film version. The filmmakers simply couldn't find a way to trump Wells (one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time) and why should they? The alternative is the aliens win  mankind is dead - that's another film (here  we stop at about a billion dead). But  I didn't agree with Spielberg's reverting to his usual safety net and letting the audience off the hook by miraculously saving the son (ok  there's always a chance he could have survived  b"
Wedding Crashers (2005),"Parts of this movie are just great; other parts seem repetitive of lots of movies of this type. Many parts are laugh out loud and laugh hard. Other parts drag.The chemistry between Wilson and Vaughn is excellent  perhaps even better than that of Ben Stiller and Wilson  which is going some. Wilson's character seems the more typical  with Vaughn having more original bits to his character. As others have said  Vaughn's performance is not to be missed. The constant analysis of situations with reference to the \rules\"" is funny in part because of the truth contained in them and the perceptiveness of the characters  even though their goals are superficial.The supporting cast is great. It has been said before  but \""when Christopher Walken is the most sane character . . . .\"" The younger sister and the brother are scene stealers. The interplay between the younger brother and the Vaughn is original and sidesplitting.Overall lots of fun. Worth the price of admission. Vince Vaughn deserved lots of attention before  for comedy and drama. This movie will establish him as a comedic star to look forward to.\tI went to this movie as a compromise with my brother - thinking  sigh  young guy movie. It was great! I laughed out loud and didn't stop. Rates up there with Something About Mary. Nothing was off limits to poke fun at. The guys who forgot to grow up  the guys who eventually grew up  but cut if close  craziness of some women  the craziness and full of shitness of some men  politics and the politically connected families  the super materialistic people that marry but don't really care about each other  the old  and pretty much everything and everyone. ...really  it isn't worth all this writing  but to give feedback  ten lines is required.\tNot a great film  it works because of the unusual situation(s) the leads find themselves in  and also the R-rated parts added back in  which are welcome. Hopefully this will remind Hollywood that there will always be an audience for R-rated material; naked women never go out of style.The characterization is barely there-- Vince Vaughn steals the movie just by showing up  and Owen Wilson is fleshed out more by Vince's actions and lines than anything Wilson brings to the proceedings. Some other fun characters show up  but aren't fleshed out at all  even Vince's psycho-stalker gets one good character line at the end  when there was so much more to be said. The movie is paced and directed amateurishly  which is no huge surprise if you look at director David Dobkin's filmography.If I wrote the movie  that would frustrate me to no end  but I only had to sit through it once  and it was adequate. Hopefully it's the re-emerging of its genre  but even if it's not  it was an okay time. Watch for an unbilled cameo  as well as Christopher Walken for no apparent reason. It's a movie-reviewer clich\u00e9 to use the word \""radiant \"" but Rachel McAdams was radiant. And Jane Seymour is still hot. Nice.\tThere is so much wrong with this movie  I could be here a week typing this. But one of the most glaring missteps (for lack of a stronger word) is the homophobic element surrounding the character of Todd. Portrayed as \""crazy \"" \""weird\"" and \""scary\"" the film takes the gay stereotype of over 30 years ago and resurrects it. It also makes sure to add  to comedic effect  the \""horror\"" of a gay man trying to seduce a straight man. Then  add in a dash of the \""looney grandmother\"" who spouts homophobic slurs for laughs. What this film does to fuel ignorance and intolerance towards gays and lesbians is no laughing matter.\tI admit that Wilson and Vaughn ham & egg pretty well together  and the plot breezes along quickly. However  it cannot move fast enough to paper over the totally implausible plot failures which made watching the film a bit difficult.These two scammers would never have been invited to the Secretary's shore compound. Sorry - claiming to be related to Aunt Nellie and Uncle Ed  or whatever  would never  ever get them to the villa or on the yachts. Once identified  the Secretary - and his daughters - would never have allowed them to marry these two grifters. I don't care how egalitarian we pretend to be - it would never occur. Everything about them was transparently false.The nymphomanical daughter? Oh  she's a keeper! Not!!! And what about the age difference? What on earth would she see in Vaughn? Sack  or whatever Claire's boyfriend was called? A more reptilian brute you'd be hard pressed to find. A Lodge? They've been going out for 3 and 1/2 years? Never. He crumbled so quickly into stereotype that he would have been discovered for the cad he was years before.While I wanted to immerse myself in the film  the total implausibility of the leaps of faith required to watch in earnest simply overwhelmed me. While we all know that the families of the powerful often have all sorts of hidden misfits and oddballs  this one takes the cake  down to the RISD student.And  frankly  I was waiting for Mr. Walken to go psycho  pull out a pistol  and dispatch any number of characters.\tThis movie was flat out hysterical. It brought me back to the good old days before there was so called political correctness. This reminded of movies like Stripes  Trading Places  Vacation and Caddyshack. Great funny R-rated comedy. Some people have written that the movie is homophobic and unrealistic. These people need to lighten up - its a comedy and a straight man being hit on by a creepy gay guy while being tied to the bed is funny particularly when that straight guy is Vince Vaughn. The midnight rape/naked homo art show rant from Vaughn is hysterical along with the scene when they are hunting quail (I'm psyched!!! Let's go kills some birds). There are many other scenes that were also ridiculously funny.Sure the movie did not make sense at times  but it is a comedy - just enjoy it. My only gripe was that the movie was too long. It was about 2 hours and it seemed some of the stuff towards the end should have been cut out. There are far worse movies to see (War of the Worlds anyone) then this and you will definitely laugh.\tThis film has everything you want in a comedy. Mainly due to fine performances from Wilson  Vaughn and show-stealer Isla Fisher this pushes all the right buttons. A laugh out loud classic. The storyline does borrow heavily from the likes of meet the Fochers and American Wedding but is more consistently funnier than both. Vaughn is on top form and this could possibly be his best role in years and stands out even if he at times is playing second fiddle to Wilson. There is lots of good back up (perhaps a little short) from big guns like Walken  Seymour and a certain Frat pack member who all benefit from the script spreading humour across all characters. In conclusion this is a fun film in a year where only dark films seem to be any good. This film needs to be seen.\tWedding Crashers was one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I enjoyed it so much  that I actually took two different people and saw it twice. It combines slapstick humor with an interesting plot  and meaningful life issues  like love  friendship  and power. I throughly enjoyed it  and would recommend it to anyone. Some of the scenes were downright hilarious. I know it has done well at the box office  and continues to deserve to do so. It is a light  fun look at life which is throughly entertaining for two hours of one's time  and makes the moviegoer leave the theater feeling entertained  and upbeat.Mitch\tThis movie was predictable  sexist and disappointing if you look at the acting and extremely GENERIC plot. It had it's funny moments but mostly highlighted the sex roles alive in this society today. You have two \""strong men\"" who want to sleep with all of the \""gullible\"" and \""EASY\"" women they can. Every stereotype ever created about men and women are displayed here and frankly I found this film to be disgusting and insulting. It is definitely a \""GUY FILM\"" in fact I think I've seen enough breasts in this film to last me for a long time. I recommend paying for it  just remember that this movie IS funny  because it pokes fun at our societal rules and stereotypes..it's about all of us-remember that when you're laughing it up  I did.\tI am so sad that Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn agreed to be part of such a terrible movie. This movie is racist  sexist homophobic and violent. Rape is never funny! Homophobia is not funny! Family members (or all members of society for that case) should not allow people to be stomped on for being different. The only actors who are not \""white\"" are portrayed as being either ridiculously simple minded or household help (not members of \""mainstream\"" society).There were a few moments that I thought were funny. However  I was offended for more of the movie than I was entertained. I considered leaving about half way through this movie  but I decided that I should give it a chance to redeem itself before I left in anger. It didn't redeem itself. If you choose to see this movie I won't judge. But  if you find this funny  I hope that you will examine the racist  sexist  homophobic and violent roots of what you call comedy!\tAside from all of the Hollywood hogwash we've endured throughout the blazes of summer  \""Wedding Crashers\"" falls in a class of its own  and can be welcomed as a bawdy  smart  and often tender fix on romantic antics and mostly classy comedy. Hysterical leads Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn really elevate the film's chaffing premise to grand comedic heights  with their jovial  affable chemistry  and witty deliverance of surprisingly smart one-liners. Rather than resorting to puerile scatological butts  \""Crashers\"" offers clever romantic skylarking for sophisticated crowds  as well as classic raunchy escapades for more demure laughter  working on many comical levels. The story showcases the goofy  albeit charming Wilson- meeting and falling for the dashing and spirited Rachel Adams  who is dying for someone of Wilson's convivial nature to come along and whisk her away from a potentially imprisoning relationship  at Secretary of Treasury Christopher Walken's other daughter's wedding  which Wilson and Vaughn initially scheme to \""crash\"". While Wilson is struggling with a growing affection for Claire Cleary which is tempering his wild-spiritedness by the day  Vince Vaughn is enduring torture of different sorts in the form of an abnormal virgin and a gay nudist art show. Eventually  you'd expect this scenario to cause a clashing between the two \""invincible party animals\""  and you'd be right. The comedy  however  is hardly mired by Wilson and Adams' watery romance  and rather  works in between Wilson's pontifications of \""the special somebody\"" and antique bike venturing along the beach  and you're left with a sweet and slushy romantic comedy. The laughs are pretty consistent throughout  as there always seems to be some comical edge in between inevitable sappiness. You'll have one particularly syrupy scene with Wilson and Adams wandering the hallways \""searching the night for one another\""  immediately followed by Vince Vaughn strapped to a bed in a not-so-pleasant hysterical episode. It's comfortably tender as well as brassily campy  and overcomes many platitudes with its nonstop charms and innuendos. Wilson and Vaughn are perhaps the perfect comedic team  and are totally believable as the shrewd and quirky chick magnets they expertly play. The concept of \""one night stands\"" has never been funnier  and the idea they are game players in \""bagging babes\"" with their \""rules of conduct\"" tunes the comedy quite affably  resulting in a crafty smartness that is often AWOL in other farcical fluff. \""Crashers\"" cruises with charming  jovial  and surprisingly sharp dialog and humor  cool and whimsical characters  and amusing scenarios that provide top of the line comedy for just about any crowd in search of something refreshingly funny to weather down the blazes of the dog days of summer. Wilson and Vaughn are a real comic treat  and \""Wedding Crashers\"" is one terrifically funny showcase of their synergistic savvies. Here's something rare: it's a comedy where you needn't check your brain at the door to have a laughingly good time  while also inviting you to lighten up and enjoy its routinely hilarious antics. ***1/2 out of ****\tLong-time friends and business partners  John and Jeremy  are divorce mediators. Although it's rather ironic that these two specialize in giving out marital advice when you consider their own personal outlook and approach to relationships  or more appropriately  their lack thereof. In their spare time  John and Jeremy are seen anticipating their favorite time of the year  the busy wedding season  during which they infiltrate various marriage ceremonies posing as distant relatives  in order to snag any available female guest or bridesmaid in attendance  if for nothing more than the purpose of indulging in a brief bedroom romp.The latest wedding that the swinging bachelors set their sights on  is a highly publicized event  since it is to take place within a family of remarkable status which is headed by the treasury secretary. To the outside observer  the Cleary family is a portrait of wealth and social prominence  but on the inside  it turns out to be quite a dysfunctional clan. There's the needy  sexually-frustrated wife  the artistic outcast son who displays homosexual tendencies  the sweet-looking  but vulgar and gun-brandishing grandmother. Then  there's sisters Claire and Gloria. John soon finds himself falling for Claire  who is obviously trapped within the confines of a potentially controlling relationship. Meanwhile  Jeremy finds himself wanting to escape the clutches of Gloria  a spoiled airhead who becomes possessive and begins latching on to him. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn have been in many previous collaborations together without actually being at the helm as a team  and I'm hoping to see a continuation of this duo in possible future projects. They are two parts of a perfectly comedic structure which is further built to greater heights with the participation of all the other supporting cast members involved  with noteworthy praise for sugary-sweet rising star Rachel McAdams and sexy bombshell Isla Fisher who portray Claire and Gloria respectively.There's also an amusing cameo appearance by Will Ferrell  who seems to be in just about every other movie these days  as a man who crashes another type of traditional congregation in an attempt to meet vulnerable women. \""Wedding Crashers\"" is obviously intended for mature audiences since it abounds with nudity and sexual references  and it manages to be explicit without having to rely on the obligatory bodily function sight gags. But beneath all of the liberal exploits  there lies a more subtle undercurrent of romance that the female demographic will be able to appreciate as well.\tIt looks like a party movie  but actually its a sweet romantic comedy. Some funny parts.Two guys crash weddings for to meet girls cheap. At a wedding with a rich well-connected family both guys fall in love. Many weird characters.I did not really care for the beginning  because two guys are not really very likable. It gets better when Rachel McAdam's character enters the movie. Good performances by Owen Wilson   Rachel McAdams and Jane Seymour. I liked the creepy gay artist brother.This movie has some mild message about love being more important than one-night stands  but that message is not really well delivered  and I think more guys will come away from this with clever ideas for crashing weddings than will decide to build an enduring relationship.\tI'm admittedly a very tough nut to crack on comedies but this one broke the shell wide open. Most of the time I chuckle once and a while at best but I was in stitches for the whole two hours in Wedding Crashers. It ranks up there close to A Fish Called Wanda  When Harry Met Sally and Get Out Your Handkerchiefs in my book. An almost seamless film that takes stereotyped characters and bends them completely out of shape. There's a touch of genius in the interaction between Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn that hints at the great comedy teams of Martin & Lewis  Burns & Allen and Abbott & Costello. Amid their screwball and cynical antics they let reveal an odd but working dynamic that drives through the madness of their own devices. Isla Fisher's addition as the kooky  nymphomanic sister is a great little sidebar entry adding more spice to the stew.This is a movie that easily could have devolved into cheap visual tricks and potty humor but managed to rise to the occasion and deliver a quality product. Even the sappy and predictable ending doesn't diminish its overall shine. A good  solid eight. I hope we see more of these guys.(BTW  my brother-in-law is a longtime wedding photographer and he says this kind of activity is not only feasible  he thinks it's fairly common at large weddings)\t\""Wedding Crashers\"" is the funniest movie I've seen so far. The film is a Vince Vaughn tour de force. Owen Wilson is good in his laid back persona we know so well. There are cameos aplenty and the supporting characters are more than wallpaper to the Vaughn and Wilson skits.Vince and Owen play 2 divorce mediators who love to show up uninvited at weddings for the free food and to pick up single women. That premises is funny by itself. Add in Vaughn's hyperactive party animal we last saw in \""Swingers\"" and Wilson's suave intellectual and it takes the comedy up a notch.This film was bust-a-gut funny for adults without being gross. Only one bathroom joke here. It was so nice to finally see a comedy that was aimed at adults and not 12 year old boys. But that doesn't mean 12 year old boys were ignored - there is some good looking women topless through out the film.Rachel McAdams plays Claire  Owen's love interest. She is the most normal of the Cleary clan. Isla Fisher's  who chews up scenes just like Vaughn  plays the spoiled crazy sister Gloria Cleary. Keir O'Donnell as Todd Cleary is the disaffected artist loner of the family and Ellen Albertini Dow plays Grandma Mary Cleary  who has some inappropriate things to say about Eleanor Roosevelt and Todd.While Christopher Walken plays it pretty straight as Secretary Cleary  Jane Seymour plays against type as Kathleen Cleary a sex starved MILF. In one scene where she is coming on to Owen Wilson I thought to myself \""Dr. Quinn!!!\"" and her inappropriate comments to Owen during the film were shockingly funny.2nd place to Vaughn for best performance has to go to Sack Lodge  played by Bradley Cooper. Cooper walks the fine line of being an ass and being over the top. He played a misogynist environmentalist who liked to hunt. That was humorous because most would think an environmentalist to be sweet and poetic all the time. Not Cooper and that was fun to watch.The story was predictable but the comedy allowed me to ignore that. The film runs about 2 hours and while it does start to drag toward the end  the final scenes allow it to end on a high note.Vaughn and Wilson were the best when they bickered but Vaughn still had the best lines and best gags. Vince should get some awards out of his performance and with dearth of good movies this year he should not have too much trouble. I dare even suggest an Oscar. His performance reminded me of Kevin Kline in \""A Fish Called Wanda\"" and Kline won an Oscar.\tThis is a tough one to review. 'Wedding Crashers' has too many plot-driven scenes where no one acts in a remotely realistic way. But it's pretty funny (and  for once  the studio didn't wuss out and remove all the profanity & nudity). The unique talents of Christopher Walken  Jane Seymour  and even co-star Owen Wilson are almost completely wasted. But co-star Vince Vaughn is hilarious and he steals his own movie (if that's possible). There are an equal number of bads & goods in this flick and director David Dobkin isn't creative enough to minimize the wrong ones while maximizing the right ones. But I laughed.Unless you have a chemical aversion to the fast-talking ingenuity of Vince Vaughn  you'll LOL too. His scenes with Isla Fisher (a cute fling who becomes a comedic psycho) pile up and the story requirements rob us of seeing Vaughn do more zany things with buddy Wilson. The early scenes are great---with their clever scheme to bust in on weddings and score with lonely women at the reception---and I wanted more of that selfish hedonism. The two man-children are at their best when they're putting people on. The climax requires sincerity and it's handled nicely enough. Give me more of the \""I wish I had the guts to pull that stuff\"" screwiness  though.Wilson's scenes with young stunner Rachel McAdams carry the plot. He falls for her at her sister's wedding and gets himself & Vaughn invited to the family home for the rest of the weekend. They're cute together  but Vaughn is the charming rogue of this picture  humorously fending off advances from more than 1 member of McAdams' screwy family. Not even daddy Walken can maintain control of his kids. There should have been more wedding crashing in 'Wedding Crashers'  although the movie certainly doesn't need to be any longer than it already is. The movie is flawed  but Vinny V in particular is a ton of fun.\tSaw \""Wedding Crashers\"" today and thought it was hilarious. The audience was all walks of life.High school aged to elderly.Everyone laughed hard and there was applause at the end of the movie. While it seems the \""Frat Pack\"" is constantly in a new movie every couple months  you can't argue with the comedic results. Anyone who likes Animal House  Bachelor Party and etc will love this flick! Vaughn really has a better comedic presence than Wilson in my opinion. This Frat Pack seems to be quite the fad for comedies the last few years. In an era of such political correctness  nice to see a flick that isn't afraid to push the envelope with things that most people think but are afraid to express publicly nowadays. Funniest movie I've seen so far in 2005. As an aside  looks way better than that upcoming Dukes of Hazzard movie. That original cast must be in distress seeing their characters botched. \""Crashers\"" on the other hand exceeded my expectations and will be on the Comedy channel for years to come I'm sure.\tMy girlfriend and I saw this movie last night. We hadn't planned on seeing it  but the movie we wanted to see was sold out.I'm glad it was sold out and we saw this one instead. It's a very  very funny movie!Both Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are great in this. If you've liked them in their previous roles then you'll love them in this. They're two of the best comedic actors currently working in films and this movie is a great showcase for them.This movie made me laugh a lot. In fact  I can't remember the last movie that made me laugh as much as this one.If you've got a good sense humor  then you've got to see it.Bud Gott\tThis movie was absolutely hysterical! Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn have amazing chemistry and Vaughn stands out in every scene he is in. There are so many funny moments in this movie that it's so hard to pick a particular one. Rachel McAdams is quite the hottie and a legit actress. I loved her in mean girls and I she's definitely gonna keep getting movie roles. But this movie would not have worked without Vince Vaughn  who is one of my favorite actors. His comedic timing is absolutely perfect and he carried this movie and Owen Wilson on his back. This movie is great fun and I definitely recommend it for mature audiences (lots of sex jokes  nudity). 9/10\tI came into this movie expecting a similar movie to Old School but I was disappointed with the outcome. First off  the movie started off like a preview because the story was poorly developed in the opening scene (not to mention that the whole plot was wrapped up in the first ten minutes meaning the plot was very weak) and immediately the audience was introduced to the two main characters crashing a wedding. From there  the movie was nonstop action of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn drinking and eating cake. I didn't understand it and it felt like my head was going round and round. I kept thinking when this chaos was going to end even though the first scene basically wrapped up the general plot  excluding the romance between the two main characters.My second problem with the movie was how inconsistent the humor was. I have a problem with most of a movie being funny  and ridiculously silly and then suddenly  there is a transition to a serious moment and the audience is wondering where the hell humor went  or are we supposed to be laughing at this? The serious parts were corny  especially the parts depicting the boyfriend as a verbal abuser and a typical prick. I just got sick of the sentimental moments following a ridiculous moment such as Jeremy's moment with the gay brother or the whole part with Will Ferrell.My last problem with the movie was Claire's boyfriend character. The character was one of the least innovative characters because every one of his actions was predictable. He just didn't add anything to the movie except a stupid excuse for Claire to fall in love with John.It had many funny parts  but I wish the movie had used less serious  romantic parts and just had stuck with the humor."""
Zoom Suit (2005),"I saw this flick at San Diego Comic Con 2005 and loved it. The movie had a comic book look and feel that I appreciated. It is very good short for fans of the 'battle suit' anime like Mobile Suit Gundam. The art was well done: the facial features of the characters are well done as are the backgrounds. The attention to detail in the animation is very good  you can see the detail of frayed holes in the main character's jeans and the strands of his hair. As for the plot  they packed a lot into a short amount of time. In the 10 minute run time  you will see crashed UFOs  a young boy's discovery of a battle suit  relentless FBI agents  and a little childhood romance. I highly recommend this short!\tvery well done animation short. It was reminiscent of Ralph Bakshi's artistry. The storyline was easy to follow. Story line seems geared towards children  but I still found it entertaining and not \childish\"".I also liked the music. Zoom Suit is about an alien suit that is found in A crash in 1947 in Roswell New Mexico  then lost during a Military exercise. Switch to present day and a twelve year old named Myles who thinks he's found a Halloween costume. I'd be interested in future projects by David Taddeo especially if they were more adult oriented. By that I mean  if the story line is geared for adults  not children. I'm going to look for the comic book as well.\tThis short animated film from David Taddeo shows promise of being a great anime series.The story involves a special armoured suit from a crashed spaceship in Roswell. Later in the future it falls into the hands of a young boy who finds out it's not just a Halloween suit. What I have heard that this was not to be missed and I was not disappointed. The techno soundtrack and sound effects running in the background complements the storyboard and \""unreal\"" artwork.I can't wait to see the animated feature and I hope they will produce quality like this.\tCan't do much better than this. The creative forces are brilliant! I expect to see more soon.This is one of nearly 1 000 films that were submitted by talented filmmakers from around the world to www.tvnet.net. Zoom Suit spins the tale of an alien battle suit recovered from the crash at Roswell New Mexico in 1947  and Myles a present day twelve year old. The suit is lost during a military exercise over New York City. Myles finds the suit  and mistakes it for a Halloween costume. Clothes make the man  or in this case the boy in this lighthearted superhero adventure.It's only 12 minutes long  but very cool  and leads into future installments. Taddeo  formerly of Marvel Entertainment conceived the idea for Zoom Suit in the early 1980's when Marvel Comics Iron Man artist Bob Layton created the memorable cover to Iron Man #117. The concept was originally created to be released as a comic book. However  Taddeo's love for comics and film have led to the creation of both formats simultaneously. The next installment of the Zoom Suit animation is scheduled for completion late October  two issues of the four issue Zoom Suit limited series comic are complete and will be solicited for sale early 2006.\tLoved the animation short. Looked like fun and made me want to give the comic a try. Their website had some of the best trailers I have seen in a while -- even better and with more care and attention than some of the bigger comic companies. Can't wait to see more.The artwork was from some of my favorite artists and the format really helped. I had wondered what Bob Layton was up to and am glad to see that he is being used fantastically here. It is great to see a veteran used in a modern way.I have a dial-up provider so the movie took a little long to load up but it was well worth the wait.\tit looks like John Taddeo has something that we should take a look at. With great talents like Bart Sears and Bob Layton to lend a hand  i couldn't take my eyes of it.Who of us hasn't wanted to go on an adventure  only to have an agency come looking for you to take over something that just fell into our laps (ok  maybe that's just me)  but maybe you should check out what our new hero does.it may not be for everybody  but for me  i'll look forward to any new developments that come out of this new project and try to get as many people as i can to give it a look as well.\tI just viewed the trailer or short for Zoom Suit. I really think it is a great story line  well animated and drawn  has the look and feel of a real comic book  except animated.I love some of the characters  especially based on their actions. The color is great as well. Comic special effects  are well  comic like and could be done a but better  but I think it does add to the quality and draws you in closer to the story. Zoom Suit seems to be getting great reviews everywhere  and I have to add my vote to that list as well. Do your self a fovea  read the comic  and see the preview for this short...\tIf you are a comic book or sci-fi fan  definitely check out this cartoon which was shown at the recent San Diego Comic Con  where I first saw it. The short features great artwork by Bob Layton  of Iron Man and X-O Manowar fame  as well as Gene Colan and Bart Sears. All of them are highly respected professionals who have been in the comic industry since the 1960/70s  so you know you are in for a treat. The animation is far superior to other cartoons of the genre and the story is both original and exciting. Hopefully this will be turned into a series  or at the very least  sequels will be made. I have recommended this to all of my comic book collecting friends. Four stars. Two thumbs way up!\tI was very surprised by this short comic film. I had never heard of the comic  but seeing this short  I think I will pick up an issue and check it out. Very interesting plot line  reminiscent of the X-Files a little. Animation itself reminds me of old style anime (Battle of the Planets  Starblazers) and I could see this being made into a series much like they were. I will definitely be checking out future shorts or trailers. The producers are definitely onto something here  especially if they are trying to draw in 30 somethings with fond memories of 80s anime. If you have 15 minutes to kill  take the time and see this short. I would bet that the producers would love to hear your comments here  positive or negative. I think I will be checking out the comic now as well. Good luck to Superverse and Assassination.\tZoom Suit was really fun and quirky. The characters are a lot of fun and the film doesn't seem to take itself too seriously.Animation style was great. The stereo-typical humor at the characters' expense was classic. Good use of character expression  color and I loved the background score (think RAMBO). Story line for the short is pretty basic  but do you expect for 10 minutes  right?I would definitely recommend watching this to anyone who comic/animation fan (especially if you liked MAXX or Aeon Flux). Creator John Taddeo has a real winner here. I hope to see more from this title. Maybe a series of shorts?\tI really liked Zoom Suit  first of all I was impressed by the artwork and cinematography. It was very fluid and I actually wasn't expecting it to be that good. Also the plays on humor and Americana were cool like in the beginning with the drinking of the alcohol by the farmers wife when they saw the UFO. I also really liked the Zoom suit  it looks great and cannot wait to see what else it can do for the young man who found it. Another reason why I liked it it that it was a short story and the right length to capture my attention  I feel that movies that go this route will keep audiences interested in what's coming next more so because you can squeeze more episodes in since they are so short. I also like the idea of using some kids in the movie because they are always faced with social challenges these days and to see how they handle conflict or change in their lives is something that interests me. This movie series looks very interesting and entertaining and I look forward to seeing more from these talented artists.\tVery solid stuff. I saw it at the 2005 San Diego Comic Con. Some comic book greats are featured such as Gene Colan  whose been in the business since the 1970s; Bart Sears whose contributions have helped mold the comic industry in the last 20 plus years; and Bob Layton  the man who made Iron Man one of the best comics of the 1980s. This isn't your typical run-of-the-mill  pump-it-out-quick animation  folks. This is high art. If you are an animation fan  like I am  you will definitely appreciate the work and care that has gone into this obvious labor of love. The story is original  the characters unique. I am glad I was able to see this little gem  as I may not have seen it  had I not gone with a friend to the screening at the San Diego Comic Con. Seek this one out  friends  you will not be disappointed.\tDavid Taddeo's \""Zoom Suit\"" is a very interesting new project. It features a deceptively simple premise  that grows more intriguing with each passing minute.I liked the animation a lot. At first it seemed somewhat simplistic  but as things progressed  it seemed to take on additional texture and  in so doing  reflected a welcome level of spirit and soul. The color scheme is very primary  but that works well for this adventure.The story is classic material for a kid's dreams (both big kids and little). At first I was wondering which way it was headed  but I was soon engrossed. It really grows on you! The basic plot revolves around a \""little guy\""  dismissed by his peers  who gets a chance to be a warrior when he finds the Zoom Suit. Who can't identify with that? It will be interesting to see this project develop. I look forward to more of Mr. Taddeo's intriguing work. As it is now  it's definitely worth a look! Zooooooooom!!!!\tZoom suit is a new film about a young boy who finds a magic space suit. It is an animated film with vibrant colours. The film shows the alienation of a young boy in a simple but effective way. With his new suit he can fit in with the rest of the kids around him but it is not that easy. The opening sequence shows great potential and the music complements the film well. The storyline is easy to follow and should appeal to the age group it represents on the screen. If handled properly it could be very good but it must be careful not to become just another copycat feature. It will be interesting to see where the film makers take us with this. It may not appeal to older viewers but as the films slogan says  If the suit fits  wear it. Good luck to the makers of the film and i will watch out for the finished product.\tLike the great Don Bluth who broke away from Disney to start producing his own creative films  John Taddeo is no doubt quickly becoming one of the great new storytellers to come out of the comic and trading card industries. He has now outdone himself with his new animated short \""Zoom Suit\"". The story is every boys dream to suddenly acquire super powers. Like \""The Greatest American Hero\"" Ralph Hinckley  Taddeo's hero  the 12 year old Myles Mason  happens to gain his new abilities and the comedic misadventures that follow from an alien battle suit he mistakes for a Halloween costume.I eagerly await many more new projects from this writer director!\tReally great cartoon all about a poor kid finding a space suit and becoming a the next super hero. The story starts in the Roswell desert in the late forties where a rancher watches a space ship crash and then finds a space suited alien dying from the crash. Years later a corrupt Government agent steals the suit but manages to lose it. It is then found by the poor youngster who is being ridiculed for his lack of Halloween costume. The suit is donned and a new super star is born. It remains to be seen where and how the Zoom Suit is used  will it be for good or evil. The new film from director Taddeo leaves you wondering. I can't wait for the finished product. The film has bright colours and the story was easy to follow.\tI thought the traditional style animation was great  its very much in the style of anime.I don't care much for the computer generated style of animation  but the switch to it at the end wasn't all the bad. I like the look of the suit and look forward to seeing its capabilities. Looks likes its gonna be and interesting and enjoyable story. I just got done reading a comic book called  \""Armor-X \"" which has a similar plot  albeit more mature then \""Zoom Suit.\"" I'm a fan of superhero comics and movies from way back  so I'm always looking for new content. I think fans of books like \""Zoom's Academy \"" and \""Ps 238 \"" will enjoy \""Zoom Suit.\""\tI finally got a chance to see this. I highly recommend it! I'm sure those of you who enjoy animation will enjoy this. I got to see more details at Wizard World Chicago. It's what got me interested in seeing this and it was worth it. So take the time to see this. I'm sure you'll be glad you did. Don't forget to check out more information at www.superverse.com. It's a pretty cool site where you can get more details about the movie and other items. There are even Limited Edition Trading Cards available. There are only 1 000 numbered sets and some of the big names in illustrators have contributed. I mean  how can you go wrong when even comic legend Gene Colan has a part in it?\tThis is one of the neatest animations I have seen in a quite a while. The graphics are great and the story is really entertaining. I've always liked animation like this  kind of old school. They've come up with an interesting story line that really lends itself well to being brought to life this way. It's about a kid who finds a space suit and is then on his way to becoming a new super hero. It will be interesting to see where they take the story from here.I am definitely gonna keep a watch for more from John Taddeo and all the others that were involved with this production.\tWe saw it at this years San Diego Comicon  and loved it. My daughter was asking for me to get her a zoom suit the rest of the con. The animation style was alright  but seemed a bit choppy in parts. Hopefully some more effective editing will help that. The story wasn't completely original  but the plot twists and humor made up for that. I'm not sure who or how they will be distributing the film  but everyone should at least try and get it on DVD eventually. It would be nice to see some DVD extras such as how they created the characters  and the whole getting the film released process  as they seemed to be having some difficulty finding distributors at the con  and I think that aspect would make some interesting storytelling for future filmmakers."""
xXx: State of the Union (2005),"Compared to this mind-numbingly awful piece of dreck  the weak first film was a masterpiece. It is genuinely shocking that Hollywood was able to produce a film this utterly inept and mindless. The writing (the screenplay is by Simon Kinberg  who somehow also wrote the excellent \Mr. and Mrs. Smith\"") and acting are dreadful - not just from non-actors like Ice Cube  but even from Oscar nominees like Willem Dafoe and Samuel L. Jackson. The plot is incomprehensible  and the CGI is so poor that some of the action scenes look like \""Tron\"".The one redeeming feature is the fact that the film is frequently  unintentionally  laugh-out-loud hilarious. Lines like \""I need to speak to this man alive\"" abound.\tI think this was a popcorn flick - I liked it but won't be running out to buy the DVD!Anyways  during the president's party (when Ice cube wanders around that room in the waiter's uniform)  a group of girls play the violins in the background. I am trying to find a copy of the music but it's not listed at the end of the movie credits. Does anyone know the name or composer or orchestra who did that music? I saw the closed captioning listing it as the \""wild  baroque melody\"". I think the same tune was played during last year's Ms. Universe as well. Thanks folks!\tWow...where do I to start? I generally stay away from sequels that don't involve the main creative team behind the first one. Writers  actors  director etc...But this one had me from the first frame...The XXX series has been called the sub-cultural Bond franchise. While it's true that this franchise has all of the classic James Bond elements it's the main characters and their backgrounds that makes these movies different than your standard secret agent film.1. You've got your larger than life one-liner spewing hero...Xander Cage  Darius stone. Their jabs are usually akin to their very different backgrounds. Xander Cage was into extreme sports and stunts. Darius Stone was an ex Navy seal and car thief.2. Then comes the action in the form of narrow escapes  massive gunfights usually against overwhelming odds and then there's always some hand to hand combat. Some people have accused actor Ice Cube of not looking the part but I don't have that complaint. He is an action movie veteran having done Ghosts of Mars so I wasn't too worried. Seeing him step up to the plate and doing his own stunts made it even better for me. He did some pretty thrilling action sequences.3. Now we have my favorite part of both the Bond and the XXX movies... Dramatic pause...The Girls yep  that's right the Bond girls. We had one girl(Asia Argento)in the first movie our so naturally our total doubles in this one. Charlie(Sunny Mabrey) shows us in classic Bond girl form that femme fatales shouldn't be trusted. She's got her beauty A smile capable of melting most men where the stand  and of course a very lethal piercing stare. All which are used as weapons in this film and yet she doesn't use her sexual whiles as overtly as say Xenia Onatop from Goldeneye. And then there's Ice Cube's ex. The beautiful car thief/chopper. Forgotten pain  and sexual tension with cube were the weapons she used and she was on his side...go figure.All in all I thought XXX 2 was a pretty cool thrill ride from start to finish. If I had to take points off it would to be for the bad CGI  (Note to the film makers: Think photo realistic not play-station...) and the short running time. This movie was only ninety minutes or so where as the first one and most of the Bond movies clocked in over two hours.Final score 8.\tXXX is back  only this time  he's not a bald white extreme sports star turned secret agent. He's now a black ex-convict with only slightly more hair in the form of Ice Cube. But that doesn't stop NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons (Samuel Jackson) from recruiting him to stop the country's Secretary of Defense (Willem Dafoe) from plotting a coup against the United States government.The premise is a non issue here and there's actually very little resembling a plot. Sure  there some whispers about protecting the president but there's nothing too complex here. The script was written by Simon Kinberg and he usually focuses on the action sequences and not the story. For example  he also wrote the screenplay for Mr. and Mrs. Smith and that film was heavy on action  low on story. The action sequences are pretty nice and entertaining to watch. The action is the real reason to watch the movie since everything else is handled poorly. Judging from the user comments  a lot of people took the film too seriously when really this sequel is a harmless movie. Obviously the story and action scenes are highly unrealistic but so what? This movie is clearly stupid and mindless yet still mildly entertaining.The acting is alright  at least the important characters can act. Ice Cube actually gives a pretty good performance as XXX. He does a better job than Vin Diesel and he shows a lot of charisma in the role as well. Samuel L. Jackson returns as Gibbons and he also gives a good performance. Willem Dafoe gives a decent performance though he isn't given very much screen time. The rest of the supporting actors aren't as good. Xzibit  Nona Gaye and Sunny Mabrey all give awful performances which isn't too surprising but they don't hurt the film.I actually like Lee Tamahori as a director. He makes his films simple yet still entertaining. Lee did a good job with this film and the action scenes look terrific. However  this is probably his weakest film yet. Despite the action scenes  the film does get a little dull. I wasn't surprised by this and there was really nothing they could have done since the film was 95 minutes long. Before I saw this sequel  I was expecting the worst. To my surprise  the movie turned out to be okay. Sure the dialog is pretty lame and character development is non existent but the movie proved to be harmless and enjoyable. In the end  this sequel is worth a rental as long as your brain is turned off. Rating 5/10\tXXX came out in 2002 starring Vin Diesel. Vin played Xander Cage  an extreme sport guy who was recruited by Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson).XXX2 came out in 2005 starring Ice Cube. Cube played Darius Stone  an ex-army Lt. who is serving 20 years for breaking his commanding officer's jaw and disobeying orders. Augustus recruits Darius to go on another mission as the new XXX. Xander Cage died  but they never show him or how he died.Bottom line is this was an unneeded sequel. Cube can't save this movie. I've seen better stuff on C-SPAN.Rated PG-13 for intense action violence and some language. Grade: D-\tFormer Navy Seal Darius Stone (Cube) escapes from prison to help his former commander (Jackson) put down a revolt against the US government.Yes  this has most of the elements of a Bond movie except Darius Stone has too much attitude for this. Was annoying at times. I would have liked to have seen Will Smith in the Cube role  but no one consulted me. Cube is okay  but too much of a bull in a China Shop at times. Will Mr. T be resurrected for the next Triple X movie? The acting was good  and the stunts and special effects were outstanding and the cinematography was exceptional. Jackson  Strauss and Defoe gave this credibility and made it more enjoyable. Strauss  in the role of the US president  utters the only \""f\"" word in the movie. Is this really necessary? Some think so. I don't. It's only done to get the PG Rating.But what made this more enjoyable was that most of the scenes were well lighted even the night shots. Yes  computer graphics are here to stay and I think they help things along  but that's just me.What didn't work: the love interest between Stone and one-time girlfriend Lola (Nona Gaye). But unlike a Bond movie  there was no chemistry here. And  her pumped-up headlights got in the way of any acting ability. As already mentioned  too much attitude by Stone and I kept seeing Mr. T instead of Cube. The music was mostly all Rap (yes  it's still around) and was annoying as well. But even with the things that didn't work  this was entertaining and did remind me of a Bond film. Again  it was the cinematography that really helped a lot.I believe the name of that girl group that played violins when Stone was at that party is BOND.\tPrisoner Darius Stone (Ice Cube) is been in prison for nine years. Stone is a thrill seeking troublemaker criminal with the extreme sports obsession. The original agent xXx (Played by Vin Diesel in the 2002 film) is been murdered. National Security Agent Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) needs a new xXx agent in his field by choosing Stone. Stone's mission is to save the U.S. government from a deadly conspiracy led by Five-Star General George Octavius Deckert (Willem Dafoe).Which Deckert is also the Secretary of Defense. The new renegade xXx agent has the skill to stop Deckert. Which Stone has a troubled past with Deckert. Stone must stop Deckert's dangerous military splinter group with the help of his friends (Xzibit & Nona Gaye) and a whiz weapons designer agent Toby Lee Shavers (Micheal Roof). Stone needs to stop Deckert before He will take control of the government in America's capital.Directed by Lee Tamahori (Along Came a Spider) made an messy but fine entertaining action thriller. Tamahori is the perfect guy to directed this film  after his successful James Bond film-\""Die Another Day\"". The Problem with the film is the script by Simon Kinberg (Mr. & Mrs. Smith  X-Men 3) is so-so. But it has enough action to overcome certain flaws. Scott Speedman co-star as Agent Kyle Steele and also co-starring is Peter Strauss as The President of the United States.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an running commentary track by the director and writer. The second commentary is by the Visual Effects Crew. DVD also has an Documentary  Featurettes and more. This Sequel was a Box Office Bomb  because of Vin Diesel and director:Rob Cohen didn't return for the sequel. But Ice Cube is in fine form. Maybe this film shouldn't be a sequel and re-titled the film to find better Box Office Success but it didn't happen. The film will play better on DVD with a good Home Theater system. Super 35. (*** \u00bd/*****).\tI thought I had seen some of the worst movies ever until I finished watching XXX: State of the Union ten minutes ago.This is BY FAR one of the worst movies ever made. I'd rank it in my mainstream bottom 3 with Catwoman and Gigli. The only reason why I watched it until the end was to see how badly executed this whole drama was going to be. Believe me  I wanted to walk out.It has barely if nothing to do with the first XXX movie. This time around  they took the usual patriotic fight-for-your-country propaganda but mixed it up with hip hop. It's the closest thing to taking a swim into a pool of puke.This \""movie\"" seems to be 100 minute rap video about the glorification of bums. It's filled with the biggest clich\u00e9s: the bad boys from the ghetto riding in their hummers  the corrupt government officials  the abusive and aggressive use of computer-generated graphics (which are WAY off  Star Wars was candy compared to that)  the endless fight scenes every five minutes  one-dimensional women characters with large curves and a hip hop soundtrack.The actors are unbearable. Ice Cube is cold (no pun intended) and acts as eloquently as Anna Kournikova in Enrique Iglesias' video. I don't know what the hell Xzibit is doing in this movie; they stayed with the obvious for him  he pimps up rides in the ghetto.I just can't write any more of this without feeling aggressive and it seems I can't even tell you everything that is so wrong about this movie. I won't waste any more time on this steaming pile.This is the biggest sell-out piece of junk I have seen in a long  long time. Horrible. Watch it at your own risk.\txXx: State of the UnionStarring: Ice Cube  Samuel L. Jackson  Willem Dafoe  Xzibit  Scott Speedman  Sunny Mabrey  Nona Gaye  Michael Roof and Peter StraussRated PG-13Genre: Action/Adventure/ThrillerxXx: State of the Union is sort of a sequel to \""xXx\""  what I mean by sort of is the fact that the director changed the main character instead of having Vin Diesel back from the first movie. Vin Diesel and director Rob Cohen were signed to do the \""xXx\"" sequel but then Rob Cohen dropped out to do \""Stealth\"" (2005) and then the director who took Rob Cohen's place decided to cut Vin Diesel out and change the whole story and having something that didn't continue from the first movie! In this movie  Ice Cube plays Darius Stone who is a tough guy who has been charged with a few crimes and plays by his own rules kind of guy and is in jail. But when Agent Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) has vast majority of his agents killed from a sneak attack including Xander Cage  Augustus Gibbons hires Darius Stone to be the new XXX agent to stop General George Deckert (Willem Dafoe) and his dangerous military group from overthrowing the U.S. Government in the nation's capital! Originally before they cut Vin Diesel out  Ice Cube was going to be a sidekick character to Vin Diesel's character which I thought was a good idea but no!! The director wanted a new main character so they decided to cut Vin Diesel out and have Ice Cube as the main character! Why couldn't they stick with the original idea with returning Vin Diesel as the main character and Ice Cube as the sidekick? That would have been better. But at least Samuel L. Jackson was the only one who returned from the first \""xXx\"" movie. Don't get me wrong I liked Ice Cube but I blame the director for ruining the \""XXX\"" franchise. If you're going to do a sequel to a hit movie you're going to do it RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!\tFirst of all: the sooner you accept the fact that the dialog is an absolutely non-essential element  the better you'll enjoy this movie.Ditto regarding the acting....oh...and the plot.Character development? Who needs it? Let's see some explosions and some bootilicious babes! (with pop-metal in the back) Appreciate it for what it is. Watch it as a truly horrible movie. Make your own \""Mystery Science Theater 3000\"" running dialog. Chuckle at IceCube as he actually appears to take himself and this role seriously. Be amused at the 30-years dated black-white contrast attempts at humor.This is a funny movie! The only thing that keeps it from being a B-classic alongside Troll 2 is a) Budget b) William Dafoe c) Large explosions (see item A) d) the hilariously out-of-place cameo by \""Bond\"" (the musicians...not James)\tDoes anyone know the name of the girl group that was playing the rock style classical music at the fancy dress dinner party where XXX was dressed as a waiter? I think it's something 'Dolls'  but I'm not sure.I was hoping to find the information in the IMDb database  but all that's listed is the rap music.I have seen them before and never got around to buying their music and now I want to follow up on in finally.Also  do you know if they ever perform in person? San Diego isn't the greatest place for such entertainment  but it could happen  right?Thanks  Rick in San Diego\tThis sequel was a lot better than i was expecting. Of course my expectations were very low. I wasn't a huge fan of the original Triple X and with a change in the main character i was intrigued to see how they fit everything into the theme of the movie. I however was pleasantly surprised. Now this was no \""great\"" movie by any means  the plot was thin  the characters had little depth  and the acting was only adequate. But the action sequences are another story. they were great  they were very well done and definitely unique. The action was really the only portion of this movie that really worked. Unfortunentaly the ending of th is film fell into the usual trap of setting everything up for another sequel. How sad that Hollywood can only see dollar signs and not make good movies.\tI really do not understand why some people criticize this movie. They obviously do not appreciate good action when they see it. I thought it was great! It contained all the suspense I needed. And at the same time it was good entertainment. If you don't like Action movies then don't watch them. Ice Cube was great!! So was Samuel Jackson and the rest of the cast. May I suggest a boring action movie.. Matrix. The cars were fantastic. I agree that nothing will ever compare with the first XXX but that was a different movie. I thought he story line was excellent. It reminded me of Tom Clancys books. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes good action  Ice Cube and Samuel Jackson.\tThat guy  thats all have have to say  what an idiot  he gave this 3 out of 4 and the remake of Bad News Bears 4 out of 4  he should just quit life right now. Anyway yeah this movie sucked  it wasn't even B movie material  it was almost as bad as Torque and Open Water  movies like these even make comedies like Harold and Kummar look rentable  but i guess not every director can be a Spielberg  not every actor can be a Hanks  not every writer can be a Tarantino  but that doesn't mean they have to produce this crap. The acting sucked all around  guess they didn't pay Jackson and Dafoe enough  the action sucked and was faker then my ex  the story was recycled and just stupid  so on and so forth  I'm done.\tFirst off I was impressed with the first movie. The sequel is just as good  but I think they put more into it than needed. I'm not saying anything bad about the movie. Okay  yes it's focused on a specific age group of 18 to 25. So what?! If you saw the first and didn't like it  why go see the sequel? I'm tired of critics who are bias towards certain genres  but continue to give bad reviews of movies they don't like in the first place. If you like these types of action/pointless violence movies than go see them. If not  do us all a favor and keep these bad reviews to yourself.Secondly  I was in the military and I know how to spot something that just doesn't fit in a shoot'em up movie. Again  I was impressed. No excuses  just results. That's how I feel about this movie. Good from beginning to end.\tLast year I saw the first \""XXX\"" movie with Vin Diesel  and recall that it seemed like a \""blue collar James Bond\"" movie. I suppose Vin Diesel either wasn't available  or too expensive  so Ice Cube plays the new agent XXX. ICE Cube is pretty good  not a Vin Diesel by any means  but the movie suffers not from him but from a very marginal script and a heavy emphasis on explosions and the special effects that go along with them. The current IMDb rating is \""4\"" and that is about right.Ice Cube is Darius Stone  former INS agent now in prison. He needs incentive to cooperate with the request for his assistance  and it comes in the news that someone is out to wipe out him and all former members of a group. So  either sit in jail and wait to be killed  or get out there and help hunt them down first. SPOILERS: Peter Strauss plays the US President  who has an agenda of peace and cooperation. His right hand military man (Willen Dafoe) feels the US would be threatened by such a stance and  in a misguided mission thinks he must neutralize the president. So most of the movie is fighting and shooting between the good agents and the bad agents  and the need to foil the attempt to get to the president. Samuel L. Jackson is Agent Augustus Gibbons. Willem Dafoe is Gen. George Octavius Deckert. Scott Speedman  of perpetual smile on his face  is miscast as Agent Kyle Steele.\tOMG...! Was that one horrible movie. I feel sorry for the writer (and everyone involved in this flick). What a dork for using so many clich\u00e9s. Luckily I endured that flick on DVD in the comfort of my living room where I could laugh out loud at the sophomoric dialog. We couldn't stand it any longer and stopped the movie (thank GOD I didn't see it in a theater). All I could think of how embarrassing it must have been for the actors to sit through the premier of that movie knowing their peers where silently laughing to themselves after it was over. What was Ice Cube thinking when he read the script. I like the guy as an actor or so I thought and was anticipating the standard over-use-of-gasoline explosions that only Hollywood thinks is credible  but I just couldn't take it any longer and cheerfully put the DVD back into it's plastic coffin.\tWhat attracted me to the original xXx was the concept: to take an extreme sports daredevil and turn him into a spy... snowboarding down an avalanche  rail- sliding with a silverware tray  etc... all very cool. But  for xXx 2  they eliminated right off the bat what made xXx unique and fun: the extreme sports bit. now  they force a ex-navy SEAL into xXx-dom (while the agency itself is wiped out). It sucks sucks sucks. This movie is full of crap  right from the beginning and has so many no-nos the list is too long to describe. I like some of Tamahori's work (The Edge was amazing) so I had a pretty good expectation  but it's worse than the worst Bond movie ever. Avoid... I didn't even finish it  which is something I never do. Believe me if you love the original xXx stay away from this one  not worth your money or even the 2 hours it takes to watch it; in this case  ignorance truly is bliss.\tI don't mind mindless  escapist entertainment ... in fact  that's why I rented this DVD. Having seen the original XXX  I knew this wouldn't be that great of a movie  but I was counting on the action sequences to pull me through.Well  apart from the beginning of the movie  XXX:State of the Union was a huge let down from even my small expectations. I guess the budget wasn't high enough for cool  exciting action sequences so they substituted old-school 80s style scenes for most of it  and suffice to say  there's a reason why most action movies don't do that stuff anymore -- it's boring. And since the action sequences are the only reason to watch something like this  and they suck  there's no real reason to give this movie even a moment's consideration.The plot involves Darius Stone (Ice Cube) replacing Vin Diesel's character as the new  improved xXx and trying to foil a plot against the President of the United States. Darius proceeds to throw people around  impress the ladies  blow stuff up etc etc etc. The basic concept is a hip-hop James Bond  and while it sounds like a cool concept that you couldn't possibly mess up  no  these guys messed it up... its not Ice Cube's fault  he's no actor but I've seen him do better than this if the movie has a script and some direction.\tYou thought it couldn't get worst than xXx  then they went and made xXx2. Originally xXx started off as an American take on James Bond  it was watchable but completely missed the point.xXx2 has changed the lead from Diesel to Cube with even more attitude. It does not work on some many levels  the story is awful and so far fetched  the action sequences rely heavily on CGI  so much so by the end that it loses the appeal.If you like unbelievable stunts  story and ex cons from the hood that can shoot better the military then you might be able to find something to enjoy.I hear that xXx3 is in the making  when will these people learn  they take good actors (Samuel L Jackson  Willem Dafoe) and make them perform such a cheesy story.Maybe watch it once to see how bad it is but you will not be impressed and will want a refund for your time and money spent"""

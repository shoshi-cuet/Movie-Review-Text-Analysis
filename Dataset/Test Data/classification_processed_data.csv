"Once again the prove themselves as ! This movie was definitely the best I  seen this summer and a lot more recognition than it is getting . People see the name Bay and instantly think of a sappy action movie not worth the time , but trust me , this one is definitely worth your time and money . I won  t comment on of the story because I don  t want to spoil it , but as a whole it is very impressive , and many that we face in today  s society . The acting is great , and off his character perfectly . The innocence and wonder that he as 6 Echo was the best I  seen from him . I  admit that the first half of the movie is better than the 2nd half , and the many chase can get , but the action a lot to the movie , and the is wonderful . But the one point that this movie tackled which it noteworthy is the characterization . I really for the two lead and to see them succeed in their goal , which is rare in most action . I even seeing the minor through the movie , so much that I about their . Not to mention that they are believable . The main character in this film  t some invulnerable super action hero , he is frail and inexperienced when it comes to fighting . There  t any that I thought he was going out of his . The are confused and weak , and they are wonderfully . Come on people , stop over the frat , comic - book , and dumb horror , and treat yourself to a good film . Don  t pass this one up . GO AND SEE IT NOW !",1
"**** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Poor Before watching  The Aviator  I knew nothing about . I had about him a couple of times , but basically knew nothing about this man . So , in a way this film was very educational . I think director Martin did an amazing job of life as a and Aviation pioneer . Every once in a while during the of this film I felt as if I  t really accomplished anything in life . lived such a fascinating life to that of an average Joe . It is really kind of sad that his got the best of him and he spend the final two of his life in isolation . Who what he could have accomplished . As for the , they were all amazing . I have never really been a fan of , but I was really with his performance . It was amazing . And the technical team was as impressive . The production design , , cinematography , , , were all at top level . And I especially how around with the color filter to resemble the of the time . RATING : 4 (****)",0
"Fabulous Film ! Very funny - made me laugh out loud which I  t expect at all ! Great animation - witty script - Highly for ALL ! I only went because my 12 year old and her to see it but it  s the film I  seen in !! The age range of our party of six was 7 to 50 and we all it . The animation was brilliant - particularly when are going wrong for the in the film ! The animation the to  expand and contract  where necessary which them even ! The dialogue between the four main is just brilliant and in some would not have been out of place in a like   or even  Sex In The City ! ( bizarrely !!). You can safely go and see this film with ANYONE of any age and will be to feel much better afterwards !!!",1
"are they are die - hard of the / graphic . are you  never even of . Even less likely is the chance that you  ever even seen one and / or are familiar with the story and its main character , . This is an entertaining movie . It  s a very cool story done very well -- regardless of what say . I don  t care if the movie is true to the comic and I don  t care if the role of accurately -- and neither should you .  t or Rush . He  t have to be -- especially in a movie like this . Much like his work as Neo , he does enough with to give the average movie - goer an enjoyable experience . This movie was a pleasant surprise and much better than I thought it would be -- considering the many . 8 / 10",1
"This movie was really good ! I would see it a million times . I cant wait until it comes out on . I need copy of it . Someone told me it would be coming out in ... its now . Anyway , the reason i love the movie so much is because of ( ). He is THE person that ever this planet !!!! So many people think that he is really hot too . I think that without his long hair he would not be as hot . So if ever this ... keep your long hair ! I know he wont ever read this but that would be good if he does . I love him SO much . Anyway the rest of the movie , i think , was really cool . Fanning is such a good actress ! This is my new favorite movie . ya !",0
"The story was , unbelievable , the acting silly . The battle were rather gory and intense but most dramatic felt . Eric was the only factor . Brad was completely miscast as one of the leading . It was hard to believe him as . The final showdown was well and I was about the outcome . In one scene slave - girl friend as him  when does it end ? and Brad  It never ... exactly my .",0
"A deep and serious drama . Not the silly comedy the trailer , although the  star  does humorous - Murphy style . : divorce , transformation , forgiveness , romance , sadness . seem to love or hate it . If you like a movie with a spiritual theme , exploring of how someone horrible betrayal and over , with romance , a handsome man and a beautiful woman , with comedic family , you will probably like this movie . Strong moral . Definitely a chick flick but my guy it too . Even the teenage in the room to enjoy . Anyone who ever been through a painful divorce will relate .",0
"When this movie was first set to be made in the late 1990  s with attached to direct , it every comic book fan  s dream come true . But after of and script out and the studio had the brilliant idea of a untested director to head the picture . Story  s only major film was the lame comedy  Taxi  and yet he landed the job to direct a movie based on comic  s first family . Story  s fist mistake was casting Alba as Storm . Her weak and wooden performance her - star , who was badly cast as The Human Torch seem as a small problem . But then there was and who were cast as The Thing and . Fantastic . These to made the movie a little better to watch . But when it comes down to it Story in action for a lame family comedy . This film had the potential to be a great action adventure film but it turns to be just another so so comic book movie .",1
"This film left me satisfied . I think off his acting style and to me was at the top of his game . I  always admired him on camera - the quiet , yet intense persona , like a man who seen life hard and this part endeared me to him for some time to come . I this film so much ; I can  t believe I was for a pimp to succeed in his endeavor ! The movie was gritty , sweaty and very entertaining . Every actor in this film was a delight to watch on screen . In addition , the was  bumping  and I left the theater with the music running through my head and I don  t even like rap ! go find the - hope it  s as good as the movie ! Excellent film ... go see it ! Two way up !",0
"If you are going to see this movie and looking for a recreation of  Willy and the Chocolate Factory  then stop now . Time Burton phenomenally this movie with amazing and design . The world of the chocolate factory is breath - taking . The amazing contrast between the drab city and the vibrant factory is one of the many stunning visual effects . The in this movie are back with just as terrible , if not more so , . is also extremely well and fully the from before . The main difference in Burton  s version is  s idea of . Wilder out to be a cynical and tormented man . as a child who only grew in physical size . He constantly from a serious tone to bitterly sarcastic to completely delusional . His character that of a child forced to live as an adult . Many people have this portrayal of to . This comparison some merit as both seem to be trapped in their childhood , but this does not demerit the performance at all . Just because such a likeness exist does not mean the Willy should not have been as such . Burton also out the movie by the background of and a short segment about the history behind the .  s twisted truly demonstrate why he turned into such a clash between childhood and adulthood . Another addition of Burton are the new for the . Instead of the stagnant from  Willy and the Factory , multiple short from various are . All completely to fit with the genre , these are a great laugh for those who have seen the original .* START * Burton even a very funny exchange of dialogue who the dance and song by the setup and .* SPOILER END * This movie is an excellent view and I completely recommend seeing it . It a much fuller movie experience and the background and the future of ; this is a large bonus as the original any background or future . If I could I would give the movie 9 . 5 out of 10 because there were only a few where the movie could have been slightly . The scene where home the ticket just to have some awkward dialogue . But by these I will give it a 9 , because 10 is reserved for perfection . To reiterate , this movie is a great new experience even for those who have seen the original . But if you are just looking for a new version with , don  t waste your money . to the original ,  and the Chocolate Factory  is an amazing experience , surpassing the original as an entire movie .",0
"I thoroughly this entrancing and engaging movie ... as did my two hip - hop loving sons , 22 and 23 , respectively . No , just a bunch of complex people with and like every one . Great cast , writing , direction . This movie is the perfect antidote to the insipid pap is churning out these days ( ?). In other , no marketing people were in for casting or story ... and somehow they to pack humor , pathos , rage , love , a whole range of very human without the help of an or product placement specialist into the movie . No King tie - either , that I know of . A lot of love went into Hustle & Flow . Best movie of the year so far . Some great music , too . the scene in the church - an amazing song .",0
"said this film is based on the H . G . novel , but it just comes out looking like a cheap sequel to Independence Day . While the script was to take place in modern times it took away the raw chemistry of the book . As far as casting goes , Cruise his regular pretty boy the world performance . Besides the silly special and the strained script , the best part of this blockbuster is Fanning . Fanning who  s only 11 old the great Cruise with little trouble . But with this in mind , still to keep the audience  s attention like he  s always to do . Overall  War of the  may top $ 200 million , but that still  t make it an instant classic .",1
"There are in this film that are extremely uncomfortable , dealing with and sexuality and seeming headlong rush into trying to grow up way too soon . But then there are of sheer hilarity that . These are all far from perfect , but then they never act so imperfect that they become or social - it was a fine line , I sat and bad  t about to happen . The are disconnected , and oddly . This film felt like a guilty pleasure and sitting next to my wife who  t laugh once made me feel all the more guilty . What these uncomfortable with the  s are the adult  s - - these seem more like . In fact , the of these is really a welcoming thing in this day and age of growing up so soon . The view of the world me of how ( of Talking / True ) the world -  and  of interest , on minutiae and the everyday  stuff , showing the absurd in the ordinary , while never condescending to any character . I this film , and found myself wishing I lived in a section of where there was still magic in believing an anonymous stranger the sun rise , and  the time .",1
"Despite the critical it  s received from and friend , I figured we  d give it a fair shake anyhow , since the rated it above our other option for the afternoon , the remake of Bad News . Oh . My . When we came out of it , my husband & I pretty much at each other and said  What the h * is everyone about ? That movie ! We seriously it . Both of us agree that it  s the best action movie we  seen all year . Maybe in two . It was fantastic ! The story was actually based on a premise we find plausible , the acting was good , the are gorgeous . was great , of course . There were funny without the . There were some silly action , but you know what ? If I am a good time , I am willing to believe that someone could fall 70 holding on to a piece of scaffolding , and somehow get caught in a net and not be injured . There was never a point where there were so many flying around it was ridiculous that they  t been shot . No one flew through the air in slow motion . Sure , there was cheesy dialogue , but I don  t go to a movie like this for the script , that  s what are for . Also , the female lead was not a ) too tough to be or b ) all up with mass cleavage and tiny . She was modestly dressed the whole time , and was competent without being over the top action hero girl . There was one sex scene , it fit with the plot , and was tastefully . Seriously , I wish I understood why people don  t like it . I thought it was bloody terrific . I  been in a good mood all day just because I had such a great time at the ! I give it two up .",0
"Whoa ! This movie made my evening , and weekend as a whole . I mean , it  s not a magnum opus , maybe a little creepy when you come to think of the concept - but the characterization and acting by the was just brilliant ! Everything was so well that you will exit from the movie theater with a smile . Unless you  re than weird , of course . While watching the movie , so many arose - Why a ( ) is made to speak with an accent ? Why is he paired with a lady ( ) 10 younger to him . Guess what - even these of get in the end ! PROLOGUE : This is not a SPOILER . It  s an explanation of how are before the time - line of the movie . The setting is 2019 . People have gotten , of course technology advanced drastically , and the concept of does exist . Noted , , sports - desire to live a longer life and a career no matter what to be done . Thus , there are in a remote institute in run by an scientist , . and his staff basically take a complete scan of the client ( the  investor ) and a clone of the same investor is with the same physical and anatomical , yet closer to perfect , . However , these , or  insurance  as they are , are bred to only be eventually for their spare - , heart , you name it , to be taken away and given to the investor to live longer . Until their termination time , they are fed on a very strict diet , and are only educated up to the level of a 15 year old . The are kept content in their inner by being told they were brought to the institute because they were   in the real world and were getting from the same . They were also a lottery where a winner to go to the  Island  - where a new world is set to begin , new breeding , no pollution , . This is until a flaw in the habilitation process and one product , ....----------------------------- and were absolutely brilliant in their acting and carried the movie from beginning to the end . I was slightly disappointed when I saw the trailer , and it that was becoming a blonde of - but I was wrong . She not only had a role to play , but it well . Hope she becomes the next as she is a truly good actress , and charming in her own way . , on the other hand , his post - Star_Wars grace very well , and should be looking for some really dramatic and in the near future to get an or some . He is a good actor , and is definitely no Bond material - too down to earth as an actor ( maybe not as a person ) to play the cocky spy . The supporting cast - only had a few to spare and was a cry baby , but an role done . -  s only   actor his role well and gracefully . is what one could call a struggling actor . I respect him for trying something new like a confused ex - con on a full season of the - his less - comedy side which he in . In the Island , he did sort of fit the role of a crazy , but he needs to find something that will bring his recognition back up . Bean , the smooth talking , villain who a Bond too early in his career , also carried his vicious role well . Would have been more appropriate to see an Southerner play the role of the institute  s head - as it was set in . Overall I gave the movie 8 / 10 . I prefer it to Minority Report , and thank God it was not too !",1
"Director Liman , who  s gotten famous for making fun like   and  Go  successfully blended together action and comedy . In  . and . Smith  and Brad star as and Jane Smith a mild mannered couple with dark . But while on a routine mission the two discover they  re both working for two . The film them becomes a fast paced chase movie filled with high octane action and rapid fire comedy one . But then there  s the plot that kind of with the and fight . The story rushed and flawed with a hint of a typical spy movie . When it comes down to it the only reason to really see this movie is to see and share the silver screen .",0
"This movie is an amazing mix of excellent action and unique humor . The only movie that comes close to this type of achievement is  The . and work very well together and if you are a fan of either of them , then you will definitely enjoy this . If , however you don  t find yourself enjoying unrealistic , than you probably won  t enjoy this , as the movie beyond what could really happen in several . I also feel that the 2hr time limit is far to short as it like the movie way too fast and I would have to have some more story development . Anyone who a good time could definitely like this . Um , gee , how much more can I compliment this great flick ?",0
"This was the first movie that I remember as a little . When I saw it , i was by the perfect acting of and Morgan Freeman . I thought all the were actually serving life . It was the first Steven King movie I  ever seen , and it gave me the wrong impression about his type of . The movie is about ( ) who is of murdering his wife and the man she was an affair with . is sent to jail were he to survive a new life behind . The movie his with the and prison . His friend being Red ( Morgan Freeman ) also those same as . And the movie the most powerful ending of any movie I  ever seen . I can say that everyone that seen this movie truly it for every aspect of it . The Acting , , and writing , .",1
"There are no to describe how disgusting and offensive this movie was . My and I went thinking it was going to be a horror flick . It was border line and had no plot what - so - ever . I can  t believe they would even give Rob Zombie and the other a camera ! No talent at all !! It is Very offensive and degrading to . It  t even scary , just very disturbing to know people actually create like this and have no morals . I  t believe all of the nudity and sexual content . It is very offensive and unnecessary when making a horror movie . Such a waste of precious time and money !!!! I felt very and disturbed as I kept watching but Needless to say , we proudly out of the filth !",1
"Lot of men truly hate this movie . I don  t blame them . An ultra - silly love story that is basically unrealistic as well as naive ; it  s a example of puppy love . However , I really do think this is an excellent film . You take away the love story , and you will see a very accurate portrayal of an very tragic event . There are some that will break everyone  s heart . One is the old couple waiting to die in their bed as their room is being by water . Another is the string quartet music while death and destruction surround them . The scene that really my gut is when the captain suicide . I find these very emotional mainly because they probably actually . Is the love story really corny ? You bet . But many such as  Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon ,  The Patient , and even  Lord of the  have lot of silly sentimental corny love story but they are much more than Titanic . I have a feeling the reason why this film got so much bad rap is that much of the audience are very young and that their being head - over - over lot of men . ( I think DID do a mediocre performance in this movie .) But the silly love story in my mind  t affect the emotionally devastating impact I had watching the powerful of death and dying .  Saving Private  is the only other film that affected me more than  Titanic  in showing the horror of human struggling to survive .",1
"I saw this movie last night , and I was not all that it . I saw the , but it is nothing like the movie . The film itself a little bit of  , a little  Clockwork Orange , a little  Last House , a tiny bit of  Silence of the  and a pinch of  Shining . It was mind blowing . It had great cinematography ( it almost felt like it was actually from the 1970  s ), great music ( especially the sequence with  Free Bird ), great direction ( better than 1000 ), great writing and great acting ( especially Ken ). The movie is more psychologically terrifying than it is  jump out at ya  terrifying like the crap we have today . Zombie is almost like , since he from all these and a great movie . Right after I saw it , it was A lot to take in . I  t even really talk about it , since I was still trying to take it all in . The movie was shocking , gross , funny , vile , twisted ... and I every minute of it . Also , I must note that at all , keep your away from this movie . I saw a family at the theater . Its not ur normal 21st century horror film . It was almost like some family taking their to see  Clockwork Orange  without a clue what either the book or movie is about . See it , but beware .",0
"The Story , as an original screenplay , could be considered for an Academy Award . The acting is world class and brought the type of performance that ... Well , let  s just say that he should be considered seriously for all the major that an actor can receive this year based on a single performance ... Seriously . The entire cast as an ensemble their !!! ( , and Ludicrous were , but they did their job ). Bottom line ... See this movie . There were people in the movie theater , at which I saw this film , that had interesting . Several people were a  movie  that was basically an extended rap video . If that  s what you  re looking for ( 50 cent ), you will not find it here . This is a  film . Art . Truth . Maturity . The medium was definitely . ( Make no mistake , there is some real grit to this film !) See it .",0
"I don  t know what else to say ... I would have given this movie a zero if I could  . It  s a shame I  m a fan of Rob Zombie but this movie was AWFUL ... it will probably be some camp classic that my will go watch at from now . Like I in the headline , it was very stylish and glossy and it did have a pretty good , the were very well ... but absolutely no substance and no plot . I can  t believe I spent 8 and 2 of my life watching it . But oh well , you can  t win them all . I don  t recommend this for if you have them and are prone to taking them to R rated ... there were a couple in the theater ... this movie is way too gruesome for them .",1
"I don  t understand people who think that the movie was bad because it  t true to the . Here is what it said : * Inspired * by the . I thought the movie was amazing . They made it than just a war movie . I like that this movie actually had character development . The battle were done perfectly , it  s worth seeing only if you want to see ( Brad ) fight . Now for the acting : I thought Brad did an outstanding job as . It made me feel like he actually Was . He gave an outstanding performance . People think he is no good and famous because he is good looking , no , he famous despite that fact . Another outstanding performance was given by Bean . I don  t know why so few even mention him . I would give him an for the role . He stole the he was in . I  t have a better . I am amazed ! Of course we all know who the  links  are : Bloom was just flat , he did nothing with his character and neither did the actress who . I watched this movie a number of times and the more I watch it the more I get the feeling that some are just their . On the other hand , the more I watch the movie the more I am amazed by , Bean . Also I would like to point out the actress who - Rose . She did a very good job and she is very pretty .:) All I know is everyone what they are able to see . Some only see the outside glow of this movie , well , I could only feel sorry for those . I would say that this movie is not for people under a certain age and a certain mental ability . It is an amazing movie .",1
"Well , maybe not so much a as it is  the way should have been . While most of the  Bat - Man  ( as the original comic was titled ) know about how his were , this film finally how into the Caped Crusader , complete with his own version of  Q  ( I always if he his himself ; now we know that they came from Fox ). Casting was excellent ; as was inspired , and he the part both with charismatic charm and with a deep empathy for and his . I  t check out the cast list fully before seeing the movie , and I kept telling myself that the actor the young really familiar ... ever a good guy before this ? Hopefully they will continue to use him in the ( of course there will be those !) so we can see his eventual rise to police commissioner . It was great to see how human the man behind the mask is ... that is something that and could not come across with ( did a better job of as a tortured soul , but not was well as Bale did ). And while I  m not a Bat addict ,  t one of the  Scarecrow  in the comic ? Wonder if that in this movie is an indication of to come .",1
"Wow !!!! What a phenomenally amazing movie !!! I have long been a fan of the book , and the Chocolate Factory , and the first  Willy  movie . That being said , I must say that I  and the Chocolate Factory  twice as much as the 1971 version . To begin with , the current version is more visually appealing . The were bright and colorful , and more in line with what you might expect from a reclusive genius  workplace . I the back story explaining Willy  s great love for chocolate and why he was so determined to make it big in the chocolate business . But all of that would be meaningless if the acting was less than great . Fortunately , all of the were tremendous !!!! No !!!! Every single one , from  s bed - ridden to the chocolate master himself . Most notably , was cute as a button from his mud high - water pants to his adorable . He brought a purity and innocence to his role that was very genuine . All of the other were deliciously annoying , as were their , which made you realize why the were so disgustingly . The - were a scream , and I thought one person to portray lots of - was a very clever and creative touch . The musical were hilarious , without the in your face moralism of the 1971 variety . But I save my praise for Willy himself , the truly great . I know he a little creepy , but  t anyone be after being alone in a chocolate factory for 15 with nothing but - for company ?!!? provided just the right amount of weirdness and sensitivity to the role and proved himself again to be one of the of our time . . never !!! This movie was a treat for so many . I was very happy to see that Burton toned down the tunnel ride . of the  71 version will know what I mean .  and the Chocolate Factory  was pure pleasure from beginning to end ! I will see it again in the theater and be the first in line to purchase the !!! Excellent movie , all the way around !!!",0
"I am not sure if I should put my input yet , because I saw about 90 % of the movie but from what I did see it was great . I was very . This film had realistic graphics and intense where I felt like there was no other way out , and the drive that was obvious in  s character to reach his son was strong . The Day After Tomorrow made me think about our . It is so true that only the strong survive . When a challenge ( if you can call the next Ice Age a challenge .....) is in front of us .. who will make it out alive ?... Survival of the fitness ...... but anyway .... Great movie , I recommend completely . A movie you can get lost in ..... ........ it  s cold in here .... hand me a sweater will you ?....",1
"of this movie are just great ; other seem repetitive of lots of of this type . Many are laugh out loud and laugh hard . Other drag . The chemistry between and is excellent , perhaps even better than that of Ben Stiller and , which is going some .  s character the more typical , with more original to his character . As have said ,  s performance is not to be . The constant analysis of with reference to the   is funny in part because of the truth in them and the perceptiveness of the , even though their are superficial . The supporting cast is great . It been said before , but  when is the most sane character . . . . The younger sister and the brother are scene . The interplay between the younger brother and the is original and sidesplitting . Overall lots of fun . Worth the price of admission . deserved lots of attention before , for comedy and drama . This movie will establish him as a comedic star to look forward to .",0
"Steven  s third  from out of this world  opus is just one big mess . It  s difficult to understand how the man who gave us the charm of E . T . and the humanity of Close could deliver such pathetic junk . The biggest problem in this film is a script so in coherency that it  s writing better to one of those bad 50  s B - fi . ( I think I just H . G . roll around in his grave for the umpteenth time .) The other big problem is the lack of empathy one for the . Cruise  s daughter is so annoying I almost wished one of the would put that screeching presence out of her misery . And what  s with ? His hammy performance was the only true bit of humor to be found anywhere . , the special effects are great and one should not expect any big statement on the human condition from big budget - fi , but we  re talking here . One not only a good show but a superior narrative from a good storyteller . On the positive side , the director goes for a much look ( a la Saving Private ) which is appropriate for the subject matter . However , maybe the movie would have worked better had it expanded the story to involve more and more the effect of the invasion outside of Cruise  s family . All in all , a total waste of talent and an even mess than the .",1
"I had about this movie from and finally got around to watching it . What a great film !!!! Rarely do and the excite me as much as this film did . The story of 2 middle aged men , both in the of a middle life crisis , heading up to Northern wine country is an absolute hoot . The writing , acting and are top notch . is excellent as the wine snob , self loathing . Church is a hoot as Jack , the groom to be who is determined to sleep his way through wine country on the eve of his impending nuptials . quiet desperation is so dead on , I am amazed that the Academy  t even nominate him for Best Actor . This movie is a delight from start to finish .",0
"Unnecessary , redundant , pointless . I don  t know what  s the deal with , but  t cutting it . Burton already the equally mediocre and equally pointless  Planet of the  remake on his resume . This movie in a summer where other 70s like  The Bad News Bear   The Horror  and  The Yard  are being brought back for no reason other than to have run out of .  t mean   is a total disaster . It many that are possibly better than  Willie . But , if you have seen both , you can imagine anyone this question :  Why bother ?. Honestly , I was in the middle of the movie . I  t leave the theater because I try to watch a complete film no matter what , but nothing could fix the feeling . I can tell that I read , and there are plenty of good out there yet to be told . If they have the courage to go for the next original hit , instead of giving people the same old stuff because it is already proved successful , they  see the erode . I am one who bowed not to see after the release of the ( second !) remake of  King .",0
"I have seen all the big of 2004 now and I am convinced this one is the best , and an all - time excellent piece off work . I have also read the novel , seen the , and to the voice - over by and Clark . The music , the camera - work , the scenery , the wardrobe , the color , the lighting , the , the writing ( particularly the adaptation of the novel ), and lots of little all contribute to the mood and meaning . They say that comedy is harder than drama . How about a combination of comedy and drama that really works ? How about such a combination , where the lead are not very attractive ? is excellent , but so is Clark . Lots of acting with little and subtle body . is perfectly cast and her character well - . Many find that the interaction between and Maya is not credible . It to me that Maya and are both more than deep enough for this to resemble real life more than the . This may not be the most profound movie ever made , and it may not advance movie - making on a technical or technique level , but this is a very good film , all around .",0

"this to be one of the worst i have seen this year ( maybe ever ). it that lately been exploring his feminine side ( see  ) but this is ridiculous !  willy  could have easily for  . it was a terrible  take  on this character . the movie just  t funny . i  t laugh once . i could hear the audience  s fake during all of the  gee , they meant this to be funny so i better laugh  . it was sad . the to willy  s were idiotic and added nothing to the story . it was what it was - filler . i could go on and on about this stinker but i won  t due to time . the thing about this mess was the total disregard for the main idea in the book ( and the first movie ). that willy was in search of a child pure of heart to run his company . remember offering a reward for any  gob stopper  that the would give him ( against willy  s )? then the gob stopper back to willy instead of , giving up untold riches - and proving he was honest and had the utmost integrity . it was the best part of the book and it still a tear to my eye . the new movie  t even touch upon this all - so - important life lesson . that honesty and integrity bring the biggest riches . but i will give credit where credit is due , and there was one thing i did like about the movie . the final - as this was the sign that i could finally leave the theater .",1
"I knew the on this flick were going to be split 50 / 50 love / hate . So I  try to stick one in the middle . For of the original , do not go into this movie the Wilder version . You WILL be disappointed . The will make you expect the same warm , but for some reason , you might leave the theater cold , and maybe angry . It was a colorful film , and there was some good acting , but the menacing , mysterious is definitely missing . Maybe it  t  s fault , but with the combination of , script , and character development , we end up with what everyone else is calling a androgynous Jacko - .  t have that semi - psychotic explosiveness that Wilder  s had .  s character is more true to the book , but let  s face it , Wilder  s the audience fear and love him at the same time . With , you have a non threatening wise cracking , high . will make the connection to , but it is doubtful that the will . does an excellent job with , and  t as annoying as the original . His family also more interaction . As far as the : was , much ; ,.. well , honestly the original definitely more like a spoiled little brat , so you were happier to see her go ; Mike is annoying in both , however , I the original  s Jay Leno - lisp . The implementation of video for the new Mike will probably connect better with though ; Violet was definitely , and her was just creepy , but thats good . The beloved familiar are gone , and while the of the new might be clever and humorous , the music is too loud and to hear it . While I was watching , I that most ended without a chuckle from the audience , and I attribute that to them being inaudible . The effects were well done , a nice surprise in this era of crap laziness in . The are all the same character , which honestly  t really bug me that much . The music is what let me down . I like the background on the , it added a little fresh air to the movie , and gave you something new , and not . You definitely get a little more knowledge of  s background as well as  s family , a dad that was not present in the first flick . I thought the background story was good , however , it was not in a timely fashion . It  s hard for this film to compete with the original , just on nostalgic value alone . The original is a fide classic , and even though technology , it is not the most important factor . Especially in a movie that is supposed to tug at your heart , as well as dazzle your . will love it , and maybe cherish it when they are older , as the older now cherish the  71 version . But us older might leave the theater disappointed ,  s greedy as they stick their in our while trying to distract us with  amazing  . Don  t get me wrong , like I said before , the was good , and the were great , but there was something missing , something to draw you in and captivate your imagination . I went into this with a solid confidence that if anyone could or should redo the original , the Burton / / crew were the to do it . I  been a huge fan of the trio since I can remember , and have had , and will continue to have faith in their creativity and vision . Corpse Bride awesome , and I  m sure Burton will redeem himself with that one . This is a delicate anomaly of a movie to review , so I  end with this : Don  t see it if you want to see a new , original . See it if you are taking your and family . The joy that they will get from it might stir up the joy you got from the original , just in case the new one  t tickle your fancy .",0
"House of 1000 more than any other horror movie I have ever seen I went to see Devil  s with very high from Zombie . I was very disappointed . The use of strong language , which was employed wonderfully in the first film , was over used and eventually completely superfluous to the film itself . And while the violence was as brutal as you would expect from Zombie it his imagination ran dry in this second film . You can only be so many times by the sight of a fleshy human mask . Even the were not as or interesting as they had been in the first film . If it had not been for giving us the Captain we came to love from the first movie , it would have been completely worthless . of the film seem to drag on endlessly , especially the scene with the movie expert rattling on and on about the . I left the feeling almost ; the invincible and completely insane , which were charming in the first film , had become these motiveless violent foul - mouthed that I was loath to watch for two . In summation , Rob Zombie took a wonderful cult horror movie and added to it an insidious sequel that is not worth the price of admission . Wait for the , then find a coupon for a free rental is my suggestion .",0
"Good Movie - Worth watching - . Bale off an amazing performance - Writing was great - Bale with his weight loss added to the his and the movie  s freakishness - glad to see it was not too predictable either - Bale only better - I hope he does a lot of like this rather than try to get to - This is one the best of the year , no doubt about it - With more people watching and hearing about it - It will live on for quite a while - From the start to the end we are brought into a strange , strange world and what a ride we go on - I want to tell everyone to watch this movie - Enjoy this movie and enjoy Bale  s performance - There is also the talented who I can  t say anything bad about her - she is amazing in anything she does",1
"The Skeleton Key is one of those thats spooky rather than scary . It the rich backdrop of New voodoo to build this great atmosphere , and then  t really do anything with it . Good all around , especially from , but the film from a very predictable plot . There  s a twist at the end of the movie , as there almost always is in these , but its it so far in advance that you  re by the time they actually reveal what . Much more  The Village  then  The  or  The Sixth Sense . As other noted the film does win for really good final five .",0
"I did not go into this movie with high ( my husband received free to an advance screening ). However , I was pleasantly ! I disagree with another reviewer - I thought the first 15 were oddly paced and poorly ( the camera is shaking as we look in on the office of a politician initially ). However , the film up from there with solid , well - , especially the role of a smart pilot who the moral of his work at one point and as a strong female pilot ( both physically and psychologically ). The audience the movie as you could tell from their laughter at  s . While the plot is a bit predictable , it truly is an enjoyable ride . Best of all , my husband is an engineer and he was with the overall accuracy of the film  for a movie . I  had to listen to him ( and his - ) complain about other , but they it too - so we give it a up in you  re in the mood for an exciting action movie - or love - with just a touch of romance ( innuendo only , nothing graphic ).",1
"After a slightly slow start ,  Skeleton Key  into an original , evocative and at times genuinely scary occult thriller so himself after his truly wretched script for  Ring 2  . I am not going into , which would be extremely destructive for a film of this kind but there are very clever character , a wonderful tension lock for the last 40 or so mainly because all the are so good . The use of props and flash - is also wonderfully rich . The setting is contemporary New and its but this is mythical south and none the worse for that . The mix of  Turn of the Screw ,  Rosemary  s Baby   Burn Witch Burn and a few other but that is to give nothing away for it them into something quite new . My only criticism would be there is something a little confined about the movie -- especially at its start -- but its style and pace and excitement this triumphantly by the end .",1
"I went into the movie with very low , and came out pleasantly . There  s more to the movie than the imply . The action is exciting , the are rather more than I , and the plot is sufficiently complex as to be interesting . But it still . Biggest among them , if you know anything at all about aircraft you  have to completely turn off your mind  s capacity for critical thought in order to enjoy the movie . It would take to list all the technical . The worst was probably the refueling blimp . Yes , that  s right , blimp . Second was probably the vast area these small aircraft cover on 1 refueling ; from a carrier in the eastern pacific , they to the / region , then into Russia , then to , then , and then back to the southeast Pacific , all in a matter of a few . That  s to say nothing of the design of the aircraft themselves , which is ludicrous .",0
"Went to see a preview of it two nights ago , and was presently with it . Very good movie . Despite the fact that it  s about four avenging their death , there is a lot of humor in it . The give each other sh * t all the time , but you can tell they love each other . Mark ( ?) did a good job , but i think my favorite character was , by . There was a lot of action , a lot of violence , very graphic , but it was well done and believable . Not exactly a movie for , but it  s a family movie . All in all , it  s very funny and uplifting ( towards the end ), but very sad .",1
"I have been to give my by the only review that was available at the time . I agree about the special effects , but the show was great ! Yes the story is some formula , but it did have a surprise or 2 , and I the way it all came together . At 2 and change for a running time , I was never , and . It what I , action all the way . I would recommend it to Beal , there is a scene by a waterfall that is amazing and no action at all , but does not have to . In addition , I kept thinking about the twist of that we arrive at the end of the movie . I am still not sure if I like the ending or not , but I definitely keep thinking about it . That to me is a sign of a good movie , you keep turning it over in your mind . I am sure snotty will tear it apart . It  t art , but , it is science . ( Science fiction , and close to home at that .)",1
"this movie :) its simply amazing and whats so wonderful about it is its simplicity and elegance ... WELL DONE AND BALE !!! as a director / writer is just great , so is Bale .. amazing acting .. and i also the anti - hero with his sly and not a bad job at all :) the movie could have used a little bit more of realism though , but still as it is its really good and no matter how much i watch it i keep wanting to watch it again ... bale  s latest movie , batman , is not 1 / 2 as good as equilibrium ... my most favorite were not just the fight or gun also how they are brainwashing the , how the fight between the underground and the is going , but i just wish it  t over - simplistic at times the ... and more depth was given to characterization or environment / setting ... still overall its a wonderful movie - one of my - go get it on and watch it NOW u wont regret it :) :)",1
"First and foremost , this is merely my personal opinion , if your here to tell me how bad of a movie it is , save it . I don  t care what you have to say , However bias it may sound , I just know a good movie when I see one . Not only was it the Best Jet li movie I have seen , I think it was one of my many favorite of many that I have seen this year . With such great like Morgan Freeman and Bob , and Jet li  s acting much as well . This movie some of my favorite from Kung - fu to drama , to action and perhaps even gore , this movie is rather violent . I think it was done so , as to convey the kind of violence that due to his evil master  s example / ways . I think the story is perfectly believable , and it just getting better , there  t a dull moment from the jaw dropping fight , some of jet li  s best I think since Fist of Legend , and Once upon a time in china . To the growing between and sam , to character and plot development . With a superb , done by a great electronic band : Massive Attack . And beautiful cinematography . I have nothing more to say except it  s the best movie I  seen all year , I suggest you go see it and enjoy it , as much as I did !",1
"this to the first movie is like Grape Juice and Wine . Though similar completely different . You would have thought and the Chocolate Factory was written specifically for Burton to make it . Not sugar coated and Happy and Cheerful as the first one . This into more of Why Willy is the way he is . why his grandfather rather than anyone else . Over all an excellent movie good for better for in the humor department . Very Visually . The problem with the first movie is it nothing . It was more of this is just the way it is , the only scene that  t make since was the boat scene , that was the only real glimpse into Willy . Highly recommend if you want to know more of the actual story .",0
"I saw this movie multiple times . I was very with the special effects and the . Fanning really brought this movie to life . She did wonderfully as a young actress . She really made you all her were real . And I was very . However , I did not give this movie a ten , because there are many they . Apparently they  t think that there were so many people out there that payed attention to detail . After the storm , I thought the power went out ? Then soon after random were on video , and shooting . How on earth did there stuff start working so fast ? When they were at the house where the airplane wreckage was , you  re telling me that the storm was strong enough to tear the roof off of an airplane , but the car  t get a dent on it ? When they arrive in Boston , why are they all so clean ? There was many just before in the movie , so why was everything there perfectly in order ? Boston is considered a main city in our country , there should have been more damage . They also really screwed up at the very end . What the heck are they talking about ? How did the destroy them ? It  t really clearly say what took the down .",0
"Aggression is something that many of us have not only felt , but have seen change other people . It is a human theme and it is therefore easy to connect to when it is shown screen . For this reason , a number of will perhaps take well to this film . However , those same people would take well to an average run - of - the - mill that with the same , as this film is no better than such . Although the and are easy to relate to , the same stuff been in many other , many times before , and the fashion that they are in here is very hackneyed . The are never better than ordinary , and they are even a tad annoying to have on screen . There is also a severe under - development of  s character , as we see her angry , but we do not see her before she , and therefore there is no contrast : no visible change . received a lot of praise for being so angry and , but she is never not - so she is just one emotional type - and I cannot call that a good performance myself . The rest of the cast deliver reasonably well , but there are no great . I really cannot call this a very good film , but if it could have brought something new in , then I feel the film could have risen above the mark .",1

"Is this the last inhabitable island ? A paradise for the lucky few lottery ? While one may think this is a rip off on some sub part 70  s B flick , I get the feeling this is a from  s Run , 1138 and . The cast is good , the script is good ... along with the story ( important ) though some action will stretch ( and maybe break ?) your belief , these are minor . All action have  reality  . I suppose it is fashionable to bash Bay . I never really attention - but I guess , because of the Pearl Harbor disaster ( the film with Ben , not the actual from 7th ), people have a deep seated hatred for the director . This hatred is seemingly enhanced by the number of that Bay in some of his . I think The Island ( TI ) got a bad rap for product placement . I think this is mostly undeserved . I did think the ( live people fighting ) was badly ... it just silly , but other   very natural - or even funny in a good way . And this to the car chase ( or one of them ). It was much better than the Matrix 2 car chase where all to be of a new origin and the only cool car was the ( also of origin , but at least it had SOME originality ). Of course the in the movie theater can get annoying ... but that  s nothing to do with the movie . I think Bay & did a very good job of setting the scene and showing us the human of Jordan and . In many ways they more human than the . Many big are raised by this movie and I think many are made about the human condition and what people will do to stay alive . How did Six Echo develop from another person ? What kind of influence did the tech / ( by ) have on . ( Bean ) up this point , but I think his lack of a real answer a bigger statement than anything else . What is real and what is human ? What is the nobility of the human spirit ... While these are different for everyone I think they are important and should have . This movie many and leaves the right . The in TI is good , the are good , Scarlet is hot and did well with her role ... I  seen this once and I give it a 9 out of 10 . I would go into this movie with as little knowledge about TI , as possible . I would ignore jaded ( who get to review !) who get fussy at the . I would also ignore the 15 year old ( is that redundant ?) who fail understand that all these are in the public domain and do not plagiarize ( unless they are !). I doubt any real 15 year old would get off the Island alive ! Maybe the only smart are & Jordan ... did a good job . It a nice build up and then the action is well paced with enough of the old to make the stand on their own .",1

"The Devil  s hit me like a sucker punch . Being a fan of 70s horror in general , I was a big fan of House of 1000 when it came out . For all the major it took for its , borrowing from other , and pseudo - art house , I found it to be enjoyable , simple horror that  t take the genre TOO seriously , without being mean spirited . When I sat down in the theater for The Devil  s , I  t really prepared for the genius bit of cinema Rob Zombie . While the of camp humor and over the top violence linger , the film itself was beautiful , - layered , and unique . While set up the deranged Firefly family as a stock group of serial , straight out of the Massacre , refined the , making for a movie that was much more realistic . Moon the annoying cackle this time around , in favor of sly deviousness and frantic as Baby . as Captain becomes the villain everyone suspected he was in , while providing most of the movie  s comic relief . But it is Bill who is the true standout as Driftwood . While the of the previous installment is terrifying at times , many of his and are derivative of , pushing the from crazy to just plain funny ( the about  scooping ice cream for s **  still me crack up ). This humor is mostly gone from . He is dark , deranged , and murderous , but the love and protection he to his  family  truly me as a viewer , and me to  s subtle and amazing performance . , he still a few great , hilarious , specifically one that OTHER madman in right now , Willy . Aside from the Firefly clan , the supporting cast is terrific . is powerful and chilling as the sheriff driven by his brother  s murder to enact revenge just as grisly as the  . The gang from  Banjo &  are utterly believable and help create some of the film  s most . Ken is a delight to genre who will recognize him as the young cop in the original Dawn of the Dead , here a struggling pimp with to Captain . and Diamond Page provide some truly sleazy as the Unholy Two , bounty who are just as amoral as their prey . A truly stellar ensemble cast indeed . Rob Zombie nearly this cast , however , with a script and style as visceral as the of 70s slasher ( Last House on the Left , the Have , and all come to mind ). Make no mistake , the Firefly family is vicious , unrepentant , and probably deserve the worst Sheriff in mind . They are , , and ; in short , they are the heart of , and humanity itself . Why then do we pull for them ? Why yearn for their escape ? This is what puzzled and confused me , me to think , and in short why I left the Devil  s speechless . While some that it was not really scary , I found it truly frightening ; that Rob Zombie could give a glimpse into the of human depravity and still find some kinship with the of such evil me . Unlike the over the top of House ... this Firefly clan as strong as any family , and scant of redemption beneath of evil . Visually , the film is stunning . Stark without being , Zombie no and a vision of the heart of . While some have it is  not a real horror film , Zombie  s vision is more frightening than any of the past few . Cannot come more highly from a fan of the genre . If you  re prepared to take a chance and be and drawn in to a world of depravity , see the Devil  s .",1

After seeing all the ways it been done in I for one am just frankly getting tired of seeing people getting and murder being off as story . Earnestly , too earnestly , offensive , occasionally funny tho well shot . Rob Zombie said he  t want people to cheer for these ? Bull @#$%.

"When I went to see this movie I that the suspense and violence would be top notch , yet I was sort of let down . First off I would not this as a horror flick , it was more of a thriller / western / revenge film . The devil  s reject group was more subdued this film , less killing , not to dramatic when they first lady all the way to the lady running with her face on hers . I mean hell when tiny at the beginning ( being ) you know going to do something in the end to help the out . That and the only people I would in this film as were and the sheriff , they did most of the killing . I have to hand it to the lady who Mother firefly she was acting like a total nut / and it was great all the way til she got hers really made he character believable . Baby just , no laughing , just acting like a 8 year old most of the time ( plus being able to throw that knife through that ladies chest plate , crap !!!). was pretty much the same character from the first although he to have it more together in this film , plus it not above . was more like a with that beard of his . The sheriff me of some crusader who was just as violent , but somehow holy . But other than that most of the were just to bland to be , too static . Hell I  t even remember the that was nor the people , or why I should have even about what to them . Too much of this movie just did not sit well with me , it just  t what I was looking for . I would say i more because of the pure violence and ( I know not a Satan lover , besides that ) That and  we got the drop on you  then it all up . Hopefully . Zombie making he like caught onto the right track to horror , though next time leave out the god damn 5 min montage at the end .",0

The level of depravity and brutality of this film is overwhelming at times and may prove to be too much for the weak . Oh well , screw the week . all you like me who organize horror movie and cult cinema nights take my advice and go see this film now . No review can sway my opinion because the only opinion I value is my own .... and some dude . to zombie for making an instant cult classic .

"... that goes without saying that it  t by a lot . In a way , Rob Zombie  s second film ,  The Devil  s , affected me the same way his music does - it  s usually self - indulgent , like it  s nobody  s business , and at times its fairly entertaining stuff , but you know while you  re listening to it there  s better material in the genre . His first film ,  House of 1000 , was below average for my , as he in the fact that he was a writer / director of a horror film by making a Stone - esquire pastiche of the genre . This time around , he goes for a more conventional narrative , though saying that one must take into account that its in the framework of a raw , un - , demented , exploitation crime film . So , there are some good about it , if under by the . As with  , the film is style over substance , or story - the from the last film , the   ( led by , in a cheerfully disturbing performance ), are on the lam from , most particularly the vengeful Sheriff ( by , for good and bad ) who  stop at nothing to see they pay for their . On the way to among ( one of which Ken , one of several obvious Zombie to past exploitation / horror with and small ), they continue the carnage . While watching the film though , one  t as concerned with any real story as much as just the atmosphere , the and who populate this late 1970  s hillbilly environment Zombie sprung up . The good are these - Zombie himself to be fairly adept at writing scathingly ( and I mean scathingly like a iron to the face ) witty at times , mostly tongue - in - cheek , and of inspired wild - ness in his style . He also the good knowledge to let his go as as possible , which at times to heighten the mood . But this into the bad sides of the film , one which some won  t be by ( mostly die - I  d figure to exploitation of the 70  s ) and some may be even more by than me : the are , by Zombie  s manipulation , by default the most sympathetic of the movie ( when to the  evil  police that is , and the innocuous ). The problem is , despite some to make them charming by some stretch , to get a viewer on the side of the anti - , he  t succeed on this level . During of the film , the ending scene ( I won  t reveal it , but to give an idea of the scene it  s done with  s  Free Bird  out ), I to think about another who  s gone in the realm of the take - no - , on the side of the film - making , . He  s not a immune to criticism , but in the sort of side - world he  s with From Dusk till Dawn and the Kill Bill ( connected by some similar ) the anti - have a kind of balance with their more sadistic and  bad  side to get a viewer for them almost . Zombie is so in love with his style of film - making and these people he  s , that he  t realize that these  t very charming people at all ( and almost all the way through ), and as the film towards a climax , it  s hard to really root for anyone . Maybe that  s the point , as a satire , but I just  t get it , and by the big finale on a road in , the whole experience of the film felt a little , well , average when in to the other  shock  Zombie tribute to . In short , the that Zombie went with in   have sort of on in  , and while there are some curious and  cool  scattered about ( along with a very good classic / souther - rock ), it becomes a little boring at times too . I  m sure after this film that Zombie may make more , better perhaps , but with   he made an uncompromising , violent , torrid , amusing , and ludicrous work here that does everything to call attention to itself ... akin to his solo music work . It  s the kind of film I can recommend more to some than .",0
"Billy Bob off what no one other then the late Walter could do , and that  s play baseball player Morris Buttermaker to a bunch of rag tag . The script does great service to it  s much from the 70  s ( going from selling to working in a vintage clothing store ), to modern times work great , with out losing the effects of the original . The trading back between and Buttermaker are funny , as a great screen chemistry with his younger star . Not suing Kelly Leak in the original , and not the classic Stein are a few of the , as is not  s hank loving character ( this time around  s favorite player is Mark , who the decided correctly to make a ) but the biggest drawback is as the  s coach . removed from Ben Stiller to pull off the worst performance in the 1998 Mystery Men , is stiff , not believable , and pretty much close to effeminate . almost the whole movie down by himself with his wooden performance . While no one can even touch the late Morrow  s portrayal in 76 ,  s performance in terrible , and him being in the role is outright unacceptable . Tanner was thankful toned down from the 1976 classic , and is no longer racist . He still , however , to be the team  s with a mouth that would make sailor  s blush . And he  s absolutely funny at it as well , and is perhaps acting talent on the roster . Worth the price of admission , and don  t buy the , the girl that does a fine job in her own right .",0
"So Bay are most likely to find little new to love here , despite the fact that this is a distinctly mature step up in his resume . Argue what you want , but it  s hard to dismiss his work as not at least entertaining , if not more than occasionally quite absurd . You see ever dollar up on the screen and every shot like it was painstakingly produced ( which also been a regular source of ridicule as well as praise ). Forget every other film he  s made and let  s get to this one . Far more intellectual than what you might expect , don  t be if your mind does not occasionally start to dwell on of morality and what a human being , well , a human being . There are harsh made about our society and our human nature to the point that you will find yourself most of the human and with the pure , selfless and ideal nature of the . Our are after all , basically and therefore have an uncorrupted view of right and wrong , and act on those accordingly . There are some very ugly of what man been capable in the service of his own selfish , and man  s capacity to rationalize the persecution or extermination of other and as either necessary or because the are less than human in their . We are quite literally even of the of the Holocaust in a harrowing incinerator scene . We further have our our recall of another recent act of inhumanity when a major character of a their part in resisting the in . All pretty heavy stuff from the guy who directed the BAD BOY . Now , make no mistake , this is still Bay spectacle stuff here , but even much of that the unique feeling of real and tangible . The seem one conceivable in the near future . There is not a lot of incomprehensible jargon to bombard you either . Even the , clearly inspired by other action themselves ( even Bay himself here ) seem fresh and clever . It  s worth the ticket price . You get some real inner debate and creepy but intelligent suspense and some genuinely exciting in a believable futuristic world . If you take healthy of - 1138 ,  S RUN and a better realization of the B Movie ( yeah , there  s a bit of that movie in here too ) and an obscure flick MST3K will recognize CLONUS then you have a pretty good idea what to expect here , and you know what ? It  t bad at all .",0
"As a first - time outing without the Jerry ,  The Island  comes off as a well considered project . While few of the in this new film are  new , Bay and and have done a more than serviceable job of from other that D . O . A . The Island  is of course a remake of  : The Clonus Horror , one of the most sordid of D - grade Mystery - Science Theater 3000 -  Coma  made on a budget of $ 350 , 000 . Straight - to - video ? Straight - to - the - Channel ? Not even close . Even never to stink  em up this bad - though he came close , many a time . But I  m supposed to be talking  The Island  here , and not  The Clonus Horror . The Island  is a good movie , built on a solid script , excellent production and sound by A - list . As I sat in the theater watching this movie , I found myself going through a mental ,   s Run , check .  The Island of . , check .  Brave New World , check .  Revenge of the Sith , check . There are even of  Total Recall  and   buried in here , as the film is a - buried - in - a - futuristic - consumer - fantasy kind of flick . The question remains , though - was this picture brought to fruition by Bay , or just one of the higher - at - as in , and . himself here , for the 6 he spent trying to imitate Alec in the woebegone  Star  . There  s a wonderful long moment in the film where we  re he was once -  Shallow Grave ,   anyone ? And ! is actually a fairly attractive woman - I really  t tell before , with her and serfdom turns in  Lost In Translation  and  Girl with a Pearl Earring . Again , who knew ? But the former Director Bay to shine through in some , with his signature and in the supporting cast : , showing greater range than before , himself once again , while   up to disgrace himself as a - poly - on - top refugee . For shame ! Is it possible to have a Bay movie without ? got over it - I suggest that Bay get of the manual and further his at meaningful content . There may be something more memorable than   or  Pearl Harbor  in Bay  s future . Let  s hope that he  s able to continue the evolution and that can catch up .",1

"After reading the  professional  I went to see Fantastic Four with some trepidation , but the film is much better than many of these would lead you to believe . The casting for the themselves was spot - on , and the film their and brilliantly . This is also the film  s only real flaw - although the showing how the Four adapt to their new - found and how they relate to each other are enjoyable , too much time is spent on this and not enough on the adventure itself . Victor Doom  s transformation to the evil Doom is done fairly well , but Doom himself  t really come across as the towering evil genius you expect from the . There is none of the egomaniacal or the grand  Who to challenge the magnificence of Doom ? type we  all come to know and love from the comic . Overall , though , the film was a pleasant surprise and well worth watching for anyone who read the . For anyone who  t but who the capacity to return to their childhood for a couple of , this is a good introduction to some clean , comic book fun .",0
"Ho hum ... another - flick serving as a vehicle to show off how far since the last - flick . yes , the is , as you  d expect these days , stunning , and the film is probably worth watching for that aspect alone if you  re into that sort of stuff . As to the non - of the film , it  s a rather tedious affair with predictable humour and uninspired dialogue . Not even close to the wit and originality of your average Bunny or cartoon ( of course , those were brilliant so I suppose that  s an unfair comparison , since no one these days able to write with that level of flair or originality ). I find when these of that it to imagine what they would be like if the were all hand - drawn as in the - computer days . Would the film still hold your interest ? In most , no . Still , is probably a good way to entertain the for an hour and a bit , but you should probably bring along some mental baggage of your own to keep your mind , since this film won  t do it for you .",1
"Seeing this movie me of the saying  You can  t kick a bark out of a dead dog . That being said , this movie so forced in its to be everything to everyone that it  t achieve any one particular aspect very well . The drama between is oddly when thinking of what kind of care they movie to make you have for them . Basically , the character interaction is stagnant , with some contractually at  s angst or whatever , until such time as the obvious crescendo is is and another stagnant character interaction . There is nothing that you care what between and the ex - relationship , save for an excuse to out some of the most forced and / or disinterested acting in ... and that a lot . Normally that  t directly make a movie abysmally bad if it action or other entertainment value ( like special effects ), but all the pomp in this film cannot save it from the commitment the movie you to invest . It  s long , long and cheesy . The little to present inner turmoil , and if it reason for it , it  t bother to make it a focal point . If an audience  t made to care about the inner , then how are they supposed to care about the and turns it to make ? If you don  t care about the , something the original trilogy in , you  t going to care when in a minute and out both their in the same breath . What ? Why  d she pick those ? Was she looking for the first thing that came to her head ? WHy  t have enough sense to foreshadow an influence for her name . All this would seem moot if the scene  t supposed to be so important in the entire saga . , as well is as a plastic 2 dimensional character , and I say 2 dimensional , because the film to out a sorry excuse of struggle of good and evil within him which basically in him saying the appropriate to tell us which side he is leaning on at the moment . Rubbish ! And when he he is reduced to the one dimensional archetype tattered super - villain we have all seen before . The only relation I had with this film was when off his operation table and in the worst and most unconvincing   I have seen in a film since your favorite Wood film , and the reason for this connection is that that is what i was screaming in my head during this entire picture . I  t much in the first place . The first two were horrible , with an amusing battle scene at the end of part , but this film is exactly what Star film  t be - Star Trek parading around as Star . I think , with all sincerity , that  new Star  vision  ( starting with his hacking the with horrible cabaret and needless ) is the product of a mid - life crisis . It is not his fault that the best STar film  t directed by him ( Empire Back ), but there is no reason for garbage like this save for lining your with the money of nostalgic Star and their . And although , i have a fondness for the , and i have that nostalgia too , I am glad I  t get into paying 7 for this trash . I it off the . is not an artist , but a capitalist .",1
"The story of the Great  s ( Colin ) journey across the east , conquering everything in his path . The movie also , , , and Rosario . Although the All - Star cast , the epic story , and the great director , the movie was not any better than average . It could not compare to any similar great historical such as Gladiator or . The movie was meant to be biographical but way too much on the theory that he was homosexuality . It very little on his but did a very good job on his childhood ( Although Colin  s dad ). Overall , the movie was very disappointing to me , considering Stone is a personal favorite and the story of the Great is also a favorite of mine . I do not recommend this movie .",0

"Sin City is the delightful and devilish idea from the mind of imaginative Frank Miller . The remake of the comic is stylish film noir at its best . This sexy movie three into one but each story one thing in common : they  re all in Basin City - a place with crooked , and . The first story is about ( ) - the rogue cop , one man absolutely determined to save a little girl from the of a sexual predator . The second is the story of ( ), an ex - con wishing to avenge the murder of his beloved . Lastly , the gorgeous ( Clive ) - a guy just wanting to look out for his barmaid ( Murphy ) but up in a war between crooked and , lead by ( Rosario ). The were outstanding . shone as , and Toro a great Boy . and Clive both put in solid for their respective . I was at Murphy  s performance , which in my opinion was definitely her best . Rosario , Alba ( Nancy ) and King ( / ) all put in sexy . The only disappointing performance was by ( ) - I felt her a little flat and one dimensional , but this did not detract from the movie . The best thing about this movie was the bold , stylish and VERY daring cinematography . It is shot in black and white , with of colour every now and again ( a red dress , blue , .). I  t be if this movie got a few under its belt for this alone . The movie into fantasy , but never quite that step , which is a bold move by . The do not wear capes , don  t fly or have special , but there is something unnatural about them that is never . The movie was an accurate representation of the , and I believe is a masterpiece of modern popular culture . Definitely * the * best comic book remake to date , and all in all , thoroughly entertaining . 4 . 5 / 5 .",1
"Not a great film , it works because of the unusual situation ( s ) the find themselves in , and also the R - rated added back in , which are welcome . Hopefully this will remind that there will always be an audience for R - rated material ; naked never go out of style .

Some other fun show up , but  t fleshed out at all , even  s - stalker one good character line at the end , when there was so much more to be said . The movie is paced and directed amateurishly , which is no huge surprise if you look at director  s . If I wrote the movie , that would frustrate me to no end , but I only had to sit through it once , and it was adequate . Hopefully it  s the re - of its genre , but even if it  s not , it was an time . Watch for an unbilled cameo , as well as for no apparent reason .

"What Dark Water from so many of its current is the of special effects in of acting . An old fashioned notion , but one that off since you really get into the in the film and care about what about them . The are uniformly excellent , from Pete  s seedy janitor to  s lead role . The tension up slowly and there are deft , such as the lawyer  s of a family while watching a movie alone . I just wish there were more like this these days . It is so tempting for a director to use effects to conjure up scary , when this film that what is is a good script and fine .",1
"Great film . The of the Thing and the Torch and their winding up of each other were superb , just like the . People say Reed is wooden , well that is what he was like ( I date back to Lee / ) in the and it worked for me .

It is rare for me to see a film more than once on release , in fact I can  t remember when I last did , but I am going to see this one again . Lastly , it was great for Jack  s name to be up on the big screen , shame he is not around to see it .",1
"Submerged starring Steven ! Its his film on and I have very mixed about it . I it because the camera effects were cool and the action was good and then I  t like it . I  go through the good and the bad below . THE GOOD 2 : The : YEAH !!! Steven ! Camera : The jumpy camera work was a cool feature to the movie . The : Steven and together in a film and they fight each other ! Is this a sign that other well known martial will be in  s future ? Hope and Vinny have . The two were neat . THE BAD 2 WORST :  s talking : He  d change his voice constantly to a light voice and then a deep voice and if that  t bad enough he  d change his accent like a southerner then to a cowboy and then back to the regular accent we  re all used too . What the heck was up with that ? The : There was only a couple but they were because they  t long I mean extremely brief ! was no match for as he got by . The big bodyguard guy was absolutely not even a sparing partner and the fight with him and ! I mean dang it , a guy like that should have longer ! Nick : Was he trying be Jack or thought he was him ? Plot : It was as everything just around back and fourth , back and fourth ! The color : The color kept on and ! Why ? The : : ( : I  m taking over this now ! Steven : You  re just have to kill me I guess ...) ( Steven : Let me ask you a question . What kind of damn fool do you think I am ? I  m still in prison for doing the same thing you  re about to ask me to do again ). I thought a lot of the was funny and I at most of it . The camera work : Why was there so much camera effects ? It funny because even when someone got they  t fall like they should . Instead it like they a and got to the ground than you  d expect ? The opera concert : the conductor up and here and there when were getting . Surely everything that funny was unintentional ? Right ? There many other I could point out but there are too many of them . You may consider this film to be one of those that are so bad is its . I would only recommend this film to people who like unintentional hilarious in and of course and . Movie  s NOTE : If you are big Steven fan like Me then I strongly recommend you to check out these other great ! Above the Law , Hard to Kill , Marked for Death ( Must see because it great !), Out for Justice ( Great !), Under Siege , On Deadly Ground ( Really good !), Under Siege 2 : Dark Territory ( Very good !), The Glimmer Man ( In My opinion his all time best and one of the ever !), Fire Down Below ( Excellent !), The Patriot , Ticker , The Foreigner ( Surprising great !), Out for a Kill , Belly of the Beast , and Into the Sun ( Great sword fighting )!",1
"Well I can  t believe some of the bad of this movie , firstly if you like predictable sweet - go watch something else . I thought it was very realistic . It was good to see some unknown whom can act . The relationship of the was well - the squabbling & for sex is something I can relate too . Also the nude scene was brilliant - for a realistically shaped woman  s body , and somebody that  t wear a t - shirt to bed and cover up with in front of her husband . Great that you could conjure up in imagination , the gory detail of the shark attack . This is not really a scary movie but more of one of humanist , , a tad of hum our , some great scenic and a small to medium dose of suspense",1
"This movie was sick ( by sick i mean awesome and disgusting at the same time )... Some were just plain disgusted , my mouth . Some where just plain amazing ( my mouth ). This movie the twisted way of life of 3 sick . Even though it the evil side of the human race it also the good side as well . This movie was so well directed i  t know who to root for . At times i and Captain Spalding to just beat on innocent . Then other I the them to kill mercilessly . Possible Spoiler ... The way Rob Zombie the that were in the hotel was unreal . No other movie . This is why Devil  s is such a classic film . Rob Zombie the evil in the human race by showing how such   people kill innocent . The Main of the story are murdering people of everyday life , such as people that are going to see Zombie  s film . This is why this movie is so incredibly good . Another Possible Spoiler ... Towards the end of the movie where The were about to be , i was for the Cop to finish these off because of all the innocent people they have . When Tiny snapped the neck , i also felt a sigh of relief . These twisted of both sides make this movie so i cant even explain . The end scene of the road block was unreal . This movie was an 8 until the end , now it is a 10 . They knew they were going to die and they went out blasting . BY FAR THE ENDING OF ANY MOVIE .",0
"From watching press about the movie and watching the , I thought the movie was going to be far more shocking than it was . It was violent and had lots of bad talk , but I was more out by the original dawn of the dead . That movie made me look away at -- one time when a zombie a large chunk out of a person in a close up . Also in the movie was a story . Normally I  t care , if there was action or good dialogue . But , the movie was too earnest and a bit cheesy . There  t too much to the movie . Not much -- at all . I don  t know what I really . I  t too of House of a thousand . And what I about one , I about the other . Both were stylish and good -- the mixed with the music were really good . I  t hate the movie . I just more senseless crazy killing , than love their too . The  t out of control or sadistic enough . A movie that really me Was Twin : Come fire walk with me , I think that is what it is . When it comes to , I give Rob Zombie his respect . He just needs more or a crap load of weirdness . Overall , the movie was decent , but I can  t say for sure . I  m confused about it .",0
"Rob Zombie took the same he for House of a Thousand and gave us a higher - budget , , and more murder - shocker - The Devil  s . This is certainly a and more polished film , with better production , occasionally brilliant camera - work , and better acting ( despite the same principal cast ). The same of the original are mostly intact - a psychotic serial killing family , vaguely satanic sadism , comedy , torture and a lot of blood . What  s missing are the , the darkness and the outright psychosis which appear in  House . And to compensate the audience for the loss of some of the which made  House  a good film , Zombie in sex - the most over - used plot device in cinematic history . Of course , its not just sex , but sexual violence mixed with torture , blood and . In other , where  house  was a dark , , creepy murder flick ,   is a light - , raw , fairly ( but not entirely ) serious murder flick . No with the script , the acting , the concept , or even the plot - but , some definite with the entertainment value of the film . This just  t terribly original and the idiosyncrasy of  House  for a typical approach . out with a police raid on the house of a thousand . Most of the family escape through a tunnel in their basement ( why the police were unable to find this tunnel is a mystery ). The police nab the mother , who up the satanic of the police her and the sheriff ( well by ) into an obsessive , vengeful state ( his brother had been by the family ago ). The leave a trail of terror and murder in their wake and it , until he is able to set his trap . I won  t go any further with the plot outline because I do not want to write a spoiler , but I do want to elaborate on  s intense performance . His rage and self - righteous wrath blur the between and quite effectively as the story . If you want to know what I mean , you  have to see the film . The Firefly family , through most of the film , consist of a lank tall man with long stringy gray hair , Captain , an evil and merciless clown and Baby ,  s daughter , a cute particularly of torturing her male . The are more or less consistent with their in  House , but I have to admit , I think Moon Zombie  s Baby was very inconsistent from film to film . In  House  she is completely and utterly insane and fearless - her shrill psychotic laughter especially well . In  , she a lot , does a lot of running - away , and is actually fairly rational with her sadistic , torture - loving murderous kin . Finally , I don  t think you can really  get  this film if you haven  t seen  House . So if you have any reason to want to see it , see  House  first . Some of the behavior of the will make little sense to you without their back - story . Bottom line : Weakly for horror .",1
"I really thought this movie was excellent , if not one of the best I  seen this year . Great story , very inspirational to the  little guy with a big dream . I  been a fan of for and am very happy to see him finally get the spotlight he should have had a long time ago . Why he  t is beyond me . He  s got the talent in and a great yet unique look . Before I knew his name , I used to call him the  really good black guy with the green  that was in so many and the occasional music video . Manning also really make this movie for me as the lovable hooker with a sweet heart . One thing I - that usually me - is that you really got to know and CARE about all the . You know how they met , why , what their were and you to see them achieve it . The entire audience was laughing , gasping or sucking in their during the film and it  s just a shame I had to drive so far to see it . It  s not in any of the around my house ... but I  m to get in the car for something good . Did it for Layer Cake , too . Anyway , no here ... just a great film ( Singleton can  t make anything bad ) that was a real inspiration . Speaking of real , I  m glad he kept it real with the Skinny Black / bathroom scene and  t   ending it . That  s exactly what usually in that situation .",0
", I  m not a big Rob Zombie fan , but I do like some of his : Living Dead Girl and . Even though I am a huge fan of pop music , there is a very soft spot on my heart for heavy metal and rock - n - roll music . As most of you know , if you have my , I am a huge horror movie fan . I House of 1000 ; it had a massacre feel and went back to the classic horror movie clique  s that most horror truly enjoy .  The Devil  s  is by far more violent and scary . Like the commercial said  They kill without reason . That  s right ! The family  s back and they  re more homicidal than ever ! House of 1000 was a little you can tell by Rob  s , I think he had more freedom with this movie . It is incredibly violent and in no way should be shown to . I  t believe actually that it was only rated R . But I did for some sick reason enjoy it . I  m not sure why , maybe because I was just in a good mood for a gory flick . In this film , Baby and completely torture this family , and I MEAN torture . Sexually , violently , mentally , your body just for what to them . But I  m not giving away . Captain is back and he  s a lot meaner than the first film . They finish off over dozen with a great ending a terrific song by the late great ,  Free Bird .  And this bird you cannot change . It  s true when it comes to this family . I would recommend this for Rob or House ... . Otherwise , it  s a pretty twisted movie that you might loose your stomach too . 8 / 10",0
"I was actually excited to see this movie , I  t anything , I was just to see another Burton film . The in the film and the factory were spectacular and . Without even paying attention to the story line it was clear this was a Burton film , truly fantastic . But Like watching a model trying to ponder physics , the beauty is only skin deep . Where was the heart in this movie ? The acting , the , the people all fell short of human behavior . Small example : A child spoiled all her life only her father with the resounding demand :  I want it Daddy . Where  s the yelling , the , no one EVER SEEN a tantrum ?? Additional Example : The hardly upset with their  s misfortune . As a parent would you not run out and help your daughter if she were by ANYTHING much less ?! The problem : I them actually . Tiny , creepy , and what a great story on how they were found . They were great until they broke into a bad song and dance . What the #*!$*#& was that ?! problem : I  s character , quirky and fun . Nevertheless , the  t add much at all to anything . And they were executed in the WORST WAYS i  ever seen .  sorry I was a . They are far better ways to have had those worked honestly . The T . V . : was he really so horrible ? I mean yes , he was obnoxious , but it  t take t . v . to do that . In fact ,  t t . v . just make him smart ? Is it so awful that he figured out how to find the bar with the ticket ? T . V .  t turn his mind to mush , it made him the who was just annoying and stubborn . The ending : Horrible , horrible , horrible . I don  t even want to talk about it .",1
"The summary should do , really . But let  s elaborate a little . Before I say anything else , I  tell you I  m a critical movie watcher . I  m , prefer as they have far more depth and diversity and I have little respect for the rubbish out of . But I still keep an eye on it . Even among the trash you can find worth keeping , and this movie definitely . The story is sobering , at least at first . It  t hold it  s when the human condition ( at least in L . A .) is , and it us racism is rampant everywhere . Yes , even in the . The quality of this movie is the complexity of the emotion that is shown - and are not black and white , if you pardon the pun . are far more rounded that we are used to seeing in . Still , Crash  t manage to keep it  s strong going for the entire duration of the movie . Sentimentalism in , some you can see from a mile away and the obligatory  happy  ending cannot be ( I don  t think you  d consider it a spoiler if I tell you most in the movie have received a lesson in life by the end ). But what we see in between opening and is strong enough to make not want to dwell on that too much - it  s also strong enough for me not to be naive and think the learned will stick , not with most of them anyway . All in all , it  s a rare thing to see a movie of this quality , with this cast , come out of the studio  s . You  t want to miss that , would you ?",0
"This is what i have to say about Devil  s .. I rooted against the good . I almost cried when Baby , , and were being tortured . I know it was just a movie , but after watching House of 1000 and then Devil  s , I just fell in love with the . Rob Zombie did a wonderful job on the in . You see more sides to them than you did in House of 1000 . did a wonderful job Mother Firefly . Of course Bill , Zombie , and were wonderful as always . In the end you felt for the trio . Even though they were evil people . A lot of gore , violence , and horror . Very vivid . Made it very exciting to watch . I do believe that the ending could have been better .. but , it was a wonderful movie , and I do plan on seeing it again and again .",1
"With the release of Star Episode : Revenge of the Sith , brought his epic space saga to a close , and to what I would imagine is the relief of everywhere , he it out on a high note . Revenge of the Sith , is , by far , the of the three in 1999 . Revenge of the Sith still many of the of his previous two : questionable , some occasionally silly and that don  t always show the in their best light . But this is all trivial to the good of Revenge of the Sith : engaging action , outstanding visual effects and the most dramatic featured in a Star film . As the film , the Galactic Republic is still in the of war with that at the conclusion of the previous film .

However , the film with a element of drama than any previous entry in the series . There is some powerful , emotional material on display here , intertwining the of various in a complex web of deceit and betrayal . Especially moving is the plight of . His character is so desperate to keep everyone that he that he actually the very he by holding on too tight and making questionable . More than any character in the Star saga , is a decidedly tragic figure , and you cannot help but feel a strong sense of pathos for him as the film . also into the nature of a totalitarian regime and how it can spring up , rather unforeseeable , from a strong and virile democracy . For the first time in the Star , Revenge of the Sith also some of grey into the conflict between good and evil , where previously everything had been in black and white . The are almost borderline arrogant , sure of their passionless approach to the universe , while the Sith seem to embrace the of . That does not necessarily change the conflict , the Sith are still evil , the good , but how the situation is what the new some strength . Of course , a Star film  t be a Star film without some serious eye - candy , and Revenge of the Sith in . The elaborate opening space battle is impressive , the screen filled to with visual information . There are several digital in the film , the most interesting being General . He is a mix of machine and living being , and he is no less a character than any flesh and blood actor featured in the film . to the digital fold again after first being with and for Episode , and again he up just as well as the puppet of old . We are also to several elaborate action set - , the being the climactic duel between and Obi - Wan . The battle on the surface of a molten lava planet , and setting is appropriate for  s decent into his own personal hell . The battle on is with a similar duel between and in the Galactic Senate chamber , and both hold our attention without fail . If Episode a weakness , it  s the acting and dialogue . While most of the do a serviceable job , at times they falter , struggling with dialogue . That being said , Episode does feature at least one standout performance , that of as . what I think is performance to date in any Star film , as his from the background to the forefront . some levity to the with his jovial performance as Obi - Wan , but is serious when necessary . his work up a notch from Episode with the , more serious . While he is saddled with some of the worst dialogue , he still it well . And so , after better than 20 , the book is finally ( theoretically ) closed on Star . I , for one , was glad to be there for the ride , and happy to see it go out on a strong note . May the Force be with you .",1
"BATMAN The title of this film to be an interesting choice . It in two the full of the film  s , whose ultimate goal was to revive a potentially lucrative franchise that left for dead ago . Unfortunately , it also an aimless , lackluster narrative that a few , fresh during its otherwise mediocre , two - and - a - half hour journey . Ultimately , the film to entertain . This failure is most apparent in its attempt to bring the two of its hero together . On the one hand is  s world , which the daylight of society ; the other world , of course , is assigned to Batman , who the night . These two make up the overall identity of the film  s hero , who really the overall name of Batman , as that character is what us most . The of this film must know this themselves : this is , after all , a Batman film , and this is what the audience to see . The film they made , however , does not reflect this knowledge . True , the film a sizable amount of its time \u0096 and budget \u0096 covering the background of everything associated with the Batman mythos , such as how he , what he , and how he his reputation as a caped crusader . Yet through it all , the character of Batman us , even when he is obviously present on - screen . Something is missing from this film , and its lack is sorely felt throughout . Perhaps it  s a sense of the majestic , of the truly heroic . For so much time is spent dissecting the various and that \u0096 not Batman yet , because the cowl is off \u0096 to employ , that once we see them in action , their use , and the way it all , is a matter of course . It is hard to be by the result , because the method been fully . This almost neurotic emphasis on the realism of Batman  s kit is strange , especially when one that the principal character was of ago , well before any of this technology even . Somehow , Batman to chase down , break crime , and even save the entire globe , without the use the film  s high - tech that would feel more at home in a Bond effort . This reliance on contemporary technology is so acute , the actual character of Batman is left ill - defined . Thus , while we can understand how he from a tall building , and to one a few below , we have no idea what kind of mettle a man to made of to even consider making that leap . Nor do we know what truly him to stay up every night , his life in the pursuit of , only to leave them at the mercy of a system that will most likely free them in a short time . A few are , and these are revenge for the death of his family ; a wounded sense of injustice ; and some - store psychology about childhood . Yet these are only partial , and hardly suffice as of Batman  s character . Most people experience a sense of injustice at some point in their ; but what is it about Batman  s that him from us , to the extent that he a costume , and down some of the most dangerous people in the city ? Most people understand the concept of revenge ; yet what is it about how is Batman  s desire for revenge is so intense that he his entire life to fighting crime ? The in the film are equally half - baked , and hollow . The lower and Batman in the film are witless by the hint of his presence , while the major of the film muster no greater reputation than that of a bully . Once Batman on the scene , they lose the tough coolness they in front of secondary , and revert to laughing , that know little of strategy , and probably  t reason through the theft of a single candy bar . city is only briefly to , and even then , our knowledge is limited to that of dark , grimy streets , and a lot of pouring rain . With few likable , genuinely heroic , the film little purchase for the viewer to grab on to during its long - winded ride . The fact that , during this ride , very little , only to the sense of ennui . The scene that almost a full hour by in a montage of that could have been taken from a mediocre kung fu flick ; while the rest of the movie a hefty amount of the , and an ambitious , villainous plot that is in a decidedly clumsy fashion . Perhaps that is a good term to describe the film  s overall mood : it is clumsy . The film to be a thoughtful , genre - origin story , for a character that fascinated many for over half a century . In this effort it , instead a mediocre status that is entirely due to an earnest cast , and an inflated , budget . Does it Entertain ? In a word , no . The film is long , and the story uneventful . The narrative is uninspired , and out by who work their , in that might as well be . The heavy - handed exposition behind every gadget is tiresome , and only in whatever the action might have brought . This is a Batman movie in name , and look , only .",0
"This  film  is full of non - stop product . The  action  consist of a close up shot of , who what , with the camera shaking relentlessly . I must give Bay credit however , because it is obvious that he basically made up the whole movie himself as he went along . His visual style is incredible , if only he would stop cutting every millisecond . The cinematography , especially of is unbelievable . She candy - colored . The contrast of the film every time she is shown is amazing , and the natural lighting is a breath of fresh air . We can see on their ! There is no chance in hell there was ever a full script for this version of the movie . It as if  s were the only that they to write down on paper and the rest they made up . The of the film is atrocious . Compare this to even the mediocre film  Minority Report . At least that film got the viewer into the story with a great opening sequence . The only decent thing about this film is the pro - life and nature . nurture it you to think about in between boring . Also , the white shot from above remind me of sperm , and many of the are shown in embryo like , violently being cut upon . Much like abortion . The character   are absolutely laughable . Bay should be ashamed at the way he black people in this film . In the extremely unfunny first act , black and men are used to make  funny  sassy sarcastic . After a black villain , by chase down the two with black , fire at them with machine relentlessly , and lead of men in the process of the city of , he suddenly becomes a  good  guy . He turns against his and to help liberate the . There is a character who to be an actor it up . He to be comic relief , but we all sat through his stone faced . There is one scene where he a gas chamber , and . Needless to say , it was the best part of the movie . This character IS the movie . When you see him , you understand the tone and the mental age of the script . I remember being 10 old . This movie was made for eight year . Overall , this film is a perfect example of how can throw in a bunch of computer graphics and a horrible script and still wonder why they are losing money .",0

"I saw House , and it because of the sick humor mixed with crazy demonic imagery . It was what I would expect from Rob Zombie . It it  s corny , it  s scary , it  s brutal , it  s sexy ( slutty , actually ) .. . Just like the cheap B that we know Rob is so of . But Devil  s  t like it  s predecessor . It is a scary , , , sadistic , mind **** from beginning to end . Now , I knew it would be more  realistic , I guess , because of the environment . The actual house in  House  was creepy , with Baby  s room with the , and Tiny  s room , with the people locked up in the of dirty laundry . Especially in . Satan  s lair , lined with , zombie - like and dead . Devil  s that extra color , but up for it with extremely bothersome imagery . There is no restraint , or mercy in this movie . There is nothing about it either . There is another review on this site that the same I am saying , but since I agree , I will reiterate . I  been that all the recent horror have stunk , and are just cheap thrill . I went to Devil  s and to see Zombie evil / fun , but instead got that scary movie I  been looking for . The were very well , however I do think good  was a bit over the top , especially during the little get together with the film expert , and a fight almost for not being . Other than that , the character acting was great . And don  t get me wrong , it it  s humor and funny , however sadistic they may be . They were all pretty funny . To sum up , the movie was superb . A good step for Zombie , while switching it up , and possibly losing a couple , he struck a nerve in a genre that it , so hopefully this movie goes over well in the Box Office , and Zombie some for some more . Too bad Grandpa  t be in this one :-( he was pretty funny .",1
"I  t believe Bay could come back after making Pearl Harbor ( the worst disappointment of my movie watching career )... and god , was I wrong . This movie is a perfect summer flick . It action , a story that sense , high entertainment and ... a babe ;-) More seriously , the story is amazing and the acting is pretty good . Many say that The Island is actually two stuck together - one , an exploration of a pretty dim universe and the second , a totally run of the mill action flick . I must agree with that . The first half is a very well made exercise in imagination and set design . The second part from terminal Bay - ism - way too many car , way too many , way too many  , and . Contrary to many summer , The Island does NOT require a major suspension of disbelief : the story really sense . I  try to see other written by the same team . The acting is very good . The two deliver as well in action than in funny ( there are a few :-) Bean a variation of his typical bad - guy role but he in it . ( the other Gladiator :-) is good but he his and ... is , as usual , a genius . The special effects are ... too good ? Bay to have the art of milking too much money from - the car are well made and are obviously expensive but they distract from the story line . Personally , i would have removed a good half of them . I , t notice any major plot , besides the fact that the main are pretty indestructible ... I  t take life insurance on them , it would be a bad bet ... There is a lot of product placement in this movie and , at one point , it laughable . Watch for a character to be Search in 2050 ... Please ... Contrary to Minority Report , the of the future are not , there good  - I knew the US car industry would come back on top ! ;-) Finally , I may buy the ... The background music is very effective . In summary - an excellent popcorn movie , by a director who the goods .",0
"i used to be a big fan of the cube really wonderful film . last week i with a friend and he said saw was even better that the previous film . i in his i remember when i was looking through the cinema  s program and i read the description two chained men and between them a dead body and each one to kill the other in 3 . i thought but i was wrong . back to that time i  m grateful i  t watch it i  t prepared for it . but then i i would give the movie a chance . i the and watching it . i only the first 15 . it was like a shock for my mind and my mentality . i stopped the film and in the next few was thinking only about it . after i to watch the rest of it i went out to see my i was standing in the and i was watching the throng there thinking  oh my god do they they are alive ? because that  s what to make his feel and he  s right - man it",1

That  s what I enjoy about his . People have unfairly this movie for no apparent reason . I don  t know why , they should stick to more fair like the Resident Evil series . I  t mind the  Dead  series ending here . Romero should continue with the Zombie but in a different direction . The man how to make this genre work ! Highly .",0
"From the end of my review of  House of 1000  a couple ago :  When we watch a horror flick , what exactly are we ? Is the one - sided nature of the conflict ( overwhelming villain , hapless or helpless victim ) part of the appeal for us ? Do we  identify with  the chaser or the ? Should we feel a little ashamed of ourselves afterwards ? Or , as Captain put it , are these just a bunch of jack - ass ? Apparently not ... For his  not a sequel   The Devil  s  Rob Zombie his previous  kitchen sink  approach to keep his camera mercilessly unblinkingly on the ( both physical and psychological ) upon those whose path to collide with Captain and ( we  re now specifically informed ) his and Baby . Someone that at times this was like watching a  snuff film ; there  s definitely a kind of  Here it is take it or leave it  atmosphere . Some have accused Zombie of   or at least  siding with  the vicious but if one at what  s actually on screen instead of the baggage one with one , all he  s really doing is showing us what  s happening . If we accuse Zombie of  in  the nastiness because he won  t cut away from it , maybe he to remind us that pain and death really  t just special effects ; a bad deed only when the doer or is stopped . Maybe we  re so used to all the eye - blink in the last few ( such as Zombie himself used in  House ) that we  come to expect cinematic mayhem to have that kind of built - in  brain cushion . Really , there  s a lot less violence in   than in  House , and it  s a lot more conventional \u0097 most of the are by gun , a few by knife , one person by a truck , which latter I knew was coming since she was standing in the damn road so damn long , so that the impact ( on me , not on the character ). The most painful thing for me to watch was the woman slapping her mother in the face so that Baby would allow her to use the bathroom ; there again , Zombie  s point to be to ask just what people are willing to do . Personally I  d p --- my pants before I  d slap my mother to amuse some vermin , but maybe it  s different for . ( Yeah , I know the character to use the bathroom break to try to escape , but how did she know Baby  t just follow her into the bathroom to watch ? That would  been right up Baby  s alley .) Zombie  s technical proficiency should no longer be in any doubt . I imagine he got the he ; of the three , as comes off the best with the character no longer to perform the clown role except once to scare a young boy ( reportedly there  s an autobiographical element there for Zombie ). a kind of 1960  s approach to life --- If you can  t eat it , drink it , smoke it or s --- w it , it  s useless . We don  t learn much more than before about his back - story although he  s now  Cutter  several times . Bill as is oddly subdued under his new beard , a far cry from his previous persona  I HOPE YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE  or  RUN RABBIT RUN . ( That line by  s sheriff near the end , although how the sheriff would have known to use the line is unclear .) He almost preoccupied as he God to strike him dead . . Moon Zombie as Baby , praise the that be , that excruciatingly annoying cackle for the most part . All three get to do some actual acting late in the going as the sheriff ( seeking revenge for his dead brother , who up in his ) turns the tables on them , them experience horror from the as opposed to the side . The new Mother Firefly up where Black left off re over - the - top , but she does manage to convey an inner depravity so old that it almost a reflex when she her tongue at . , as usual , the screen whenever he  s on it . Kudos to personal favorite and a big scarred lug unknown to me as a couple of for hire , the kind of casual stone - bad - for whom the goofy serial - killer are about as alarming as excrement on their boots . My favorite scene was with the pimp and his minion ( a sadly aging from  The Have  ) a couple of from an enormous concerned lest his merchandise be used for sexual . It  s profanely funny with sharply written dialogue , unlike the  F --- you !  Well , f --- you too ! . we get for much of the running time . .... Those Zombie to use his own music for   will be disappointed ( I admit I was ). It  s mostly Southern - rock that we  on the radio a million times . Gee whiz , we even get  Free Bird  at the end as the soon - to - be - satanically - ride off to their final lead - filled confrontation with law enforcement who , by the way , need to take a course in how to storm a building armed .... If Zombie had to use at the end , why not  Back My ? I really could have done without the film critic scene ; it was funny but absolutely inserted ; ,  , we get it , we got it before . I know a lot of real haven  t been kind to Rob but there must  been some other way to get back at them . I would  rather had the . Satan scene that he reportedly shot but  t use --- maybe . Satan torturing a film critic ? ..",1
"This movie is adequate , but it could have been much better . I have a few about the movie , but first I want to give my opinion on some of the better . was awesome as the sheriff . I don  t think anyone else could have done better in the inner struggle with vengeance and he was just gruff enough to put froth that image of a hard ass sheriff . of course was decent , although not as good as in . It like he  t have as many and not near as many sarcastic scathing tongue - like he did in either . You do get an interesting scene when he wakes up from a dream next to his ... um ... . to follow : now what I  t like . The stupidity in this movie is amazing . First off , you have surrounding the house , getting into position and then the Sheriff simply out the megaphone and their presence ( them to come out with up ) and of course this to a . Pretty lame indeed , not to mention the shoddy  of the Round Table  armor that some of the family had on , which was pretty ridiculous ; me of the beast thing that around Marc Singer in the . Anyway , after that , Baby and escape , get a car only to STOP at a hotel to rest !! is listening to the radio , their all over the radio and to stop at the local hotel to rest .. but I would think you would try to get as FAR AS POSSIBLE from that town . But of course Rob Zombie had to have them come upon an old band and slaughter them ( which also  t have much creativity ). Then you have the Sheriff ( after he up and the hell out of and with a / cattle prod type deal and stapler ) light the house on fire after he it with gas , goes outside for at least 10 , yet and get SAVED by Tiny who is at best a of on . I was about to seriously take off a couple for the ending , as the movie into by and you are lead to believe that the torrent trio got away - free only to meander on a road block with the rest of the sheriff  s department . Luckily , for realism  s sake they ARE NOT able to drive right through with 20 this time ( Should have  s armor ) The music  t do it for me either . It to slow down the movie . Rob should have stuck more to his and used Metal to keep the pace Quick and Hard instead of twangy , slow and   5 . 7 / 10 ( mostly in part to  s great acting ) Violence Meter ::::::: 7Nudity ::::: 5Language ::::::::: 9NOT FOR !!!!",0
"Rarely do I like the post - modern device of the ending of a film at the beginning . It usually of pretension , as if the is saying ,  My film is so important , it  t need like suspense . But done thoughtfully , the technique can build tension and draw in the viewer rather than alienate . This is the Case in The Upside of Anger , which off with a scene with the main on their way to a funeral . Director Mike Binder this to advantage , however , so that each scene is with tension it otherwise would have . Of course the ending will be the hook that most into conversation about this film . Is it manipulative ? Does it fit ? I argue not only does it fit , it you two in one ; the one you just saw and the one which you will replay in your mind given the ending . The film is not without . In family , as with actual , sometimes one child is given less attention . In Upside , it  s  s character who almost to be from a different family altogether . This may be Binder  s point , but by not , he is forced to balance too many story , more interesting . For example , Binder  s character ,  , is a gem in this picture and really a unique point of view . The film to be begging for a final scene between   and  s character . The score is also weak , on to tell us whether a scene is comic or dramatic . The strength of this picture is that it \u0097 it is a drama with comic \u0097 and the music this . In any case , every single actor is exceptional \u0097 especially and  s . Every time to have slipped into parody , he one of these sublime that remind you why he  s a screen idol . And if  t nominated for aplenty for her work here , I suppose that would be the downside to The Upside of Anger .",1
"And The Chocolate Factory will be and at as ( what most movie fear ) a remake . However it  s not . It  s not even close to the original which starred Gene Wilder and is one of my top 100 favorite of all time . Willy & The Chocolate Factory was so far off form the book which was written by that ( Who was to detest the original ) to sign off for a sequel . If was alive today he would have been very happy with Burton  s version . It is practically word for word , scene for scene just like the book of the same name . The plot is simple . Willy is a candy god . The world him . Then for which I will not explain because that would spoil the movie for you he his candy factory forever . Then out of the clear blue he that he is not only going to open the again but he is going to allow five lucky to tour his factory , something that never been before . He this contest by five golden in his . The five lucky are a heavy from who , , and for chocolate . we have Violet . A little girl from who  s motto is winning is everything . She finishing any place but the top . Then we have Salt . A spoiled little rich girl from , . She a father who  s opinion on the world is money can buy everything . There  s also Mike who  s life video . He  s a snot nosed punk who will stop at nothing to insult , cut down , or humiliate anyone in his path . Then finally we have Bucket . A bright little boy who the heart of gold . He in a shack with his and his four . They barely have any money to put food on the table . is extremely tight with his Grandpa Joe . Who with his of Willy . is the one child who this prize more than anybody and it because unlike all the other spoiled in the film is a working class blue collar who you just can  t help but feel bad for . After the are found the meet the man who is their hero . Willy himself by Tin Burton alumni ( , Wood , Sleepy Hollow , and the upcoming animated Burton film The Corpse Bride ) who his own as . . is nothing what these think he  s going to be . He  s rude , brash , and a complete wise ass . In one scene when Violet her arms around him and  I  m Violet  down at her with an uncomfortable expression and  I don  t care . The chocolate factory is a child  s imagination come to life and no one an eye for eye candy the way Burton does . If you  never seen a Burton film then check out Beetle Juice , , Sleepy Hollow , or The Nightmare Before and you  see what I mean . This movie my faith in Burton when   a classic ( although as i said before this film is not a remake ) but I  m a Burton and have all his , yes even Planet of the ( yes I  m the one ). After the debacle that was Planet Of The ( 2000 ) it like Burton  s career was over . The movie was a bomb and by most that saw it basically giving a lot of heat about the ending ( although P . O . T . A . a better ending than the recent War Of The remake I  been told ) but Burton back with the masterpiece Big Fish . He  t the ball since . And The Chocolate Factory is one of Burton  s best and great eye candy as well as laugh  s with  s and the  s ( all by one man who  s been  d to make millions of  s ) and the in the are funny as hell . As for , he hold  s his own as Willy . Believe me he some big to fill from Gene Wilder  s . However as I said before this movie is so different from the original it into the and category . It  s hard to compare which one is better . The original is still a great film that I will always love . Burton  s version right up there with it . Burton  s version is almost scene for scene , word for word just like the book . The original is not even close . Which is why I can  t even compare the two as well as tell you who was the better Willy . Again and . If you want a good time at the where you can just leave your brain at the door and get lost in a weird , wonderful world then i highly recommend And The Chocolate Factory . Burton will love it . It up there with Sleepy Hollow , , Beetle Juice , , and Big Fish . Even people that have never seen a Burton film ( Pee - Wee  s Big Adventure , Beetle Juice , Batman , , Batman , The Nightmare Before , Wood , , Sleepy Hollow , Planet Of The , Big Fish and the upcoming Corpse Bride ) will have a tough time not enjoying And The Chocolate Factory . It  s a great time at the . Heck you  find yourself wanting to go by candy as soon as the begin to roll . On a scale of 10 I give And The Chocolate Factory a 10 . Go and enjoy . You won  t regret it .",0
"There is so much wrong with this movie , I could be here a week this .

"Well . I  so many bad about this movie . so I  m say what i think . I  had the pleasure of reading the book and the displeasure of seeing the original . In my opinion this version totally out does the Gene wilder version . the actually all look alike , their not any freakish colors , there  s no creepy tunnel scene . and not nearly as much singing * thank god * singing is but to much is a bad thing . and the they do have in this version are much much better . This movie also that the original  t . i mean . It why willy is such a recluse , why he no family . what after they get into the elevator . the original ... it was like all that is they get in the elevator and thats that . I find this movie one of Best yet . also to the last movie ... this one is way more heartfelt . in my opinion anyways .... and plus is a much better actor then gene wilder .",1

"Both Cruise and are big of the old film , and it . The only trace of the actual book that their determination to tribute it  s first movie incarnation is the change of the from flying type to actual . Other then that the entire film is just an attempt to put a marginally different perspective on the 50  s version . To be fair , it does start out well ( and there are some good cinematic throughout ). Some claim it well for about 2 / 3rds of the film , but I think in truth it is only the first 3rd that works at all . It  t take long for and overly predictable plot to creep in and there is nothing daring or risky about anything by after about 20 in . It  s all very well for people to go on about the focus on the main Character . But I don  t think that is particularly . There are a good number of other I think can bring off a personal perspective much better so I don  t think is even to his on this one . Plus , when you have an astronomical budget , one major star and material a good 80 % of the audience will already know pretty well ( anyone not know how it was going to end ?), it pretty much goes without saying that people are going to want to see a lot more of the . It  s all very well to point to the of good horror and claim not seeing stuff is suspenseful but is it entirely appropriate for this particular film ? I would say not . If to do a film like that , why not come up with something fresh rather then doing a remake of a well known film based on a well known book . When you already know what is going on , there is nothing by not showing it . The film  t need to worry about action as in actual fact this film should never have been an action film . Humanity can  t defend against these , so why show anything but futility . Perhaps because that  t be very , and for all the good of the film it into pretty standard action by the end anyway . What I would have to have seen would have been more dramatic spectacles , barren , shocking of destruction , . More of the and perhaps show how the totally to stop them with everything they tried . They actually that in the 40  s film , so one of the did leave out was the one aspect that really gave the  not by man  aspect . As a result the very end leaves you cold , and as a big slap in the face to the book they include a voice over copied directly from the 50  s film everything in a religious point of view ( the one thing that really let down the 40  s film ). The book was to a large extent very anti - religious and there was no need to ignore that very important aspect of the original story . It  s not even comfortably put on the end , because with the ( totally unnecessary ) heroic by Cruise early it like we  suddenly cut to the end of a different film . Perhaps the influence of the 50  s film was too much for him . After all , anyone ever notice how similar to the in the 50  s film ? If you were to take those and make them cute , you  d end up with . Certainly not a - incidence . This is very much what must have been his film . One thing with I always found annoying is his obsession with getting that let see the film . For a start no other director could release like this and like park ( where arm is off his body ) and get such family . But even with his ability to manipulate , he still to hold back from making what the film should have been just for the sake of the see it . I guess at the end of the day it  s all about money and ego and not just about making a really good film . So there you go . I gave this a disappointing 4 out of 10 . It had a lot of potential but there are so many and so many mixed up that are never fully I just  t give it a good score . I  t even give it an average score , because with , Cruise and the special effects budget I have to compare it to what I think should have been possible with the money spent and talent involved . This film is one of the great of the modern day . Compare that to the 50  s film , which for the time period had stunning effects , a compelling plot and that were all to understandable given the time of . It way ahead of it  s time and is still a reasonable watch even five later . Can anyone honestly say this will last so well ?",1
"Much like the of it  s plot , treacherously a thin line between a divide . The film  t dark or deep enough to be considered along the same as the of Batman , and at the same time it  s not camp or over the top enough to be considered a  fun  comic book flick . This is one of the main for the film , as with this strange of the film ; it cut out both of the comic book , and left itself with a film that is as as it  s lead actor  s acting is weak . The plot to jump from one happening to another , often without any kind of explanation or logic . This this film a very turgid experience , and the fact that the plotting is so carelessly done also left the movie a good twenty overlong ; which only in making the film more painful . It  s a shame that this film  t better , as it a plot that could have lent itself to a very fun flick . The plot ; a man that can see the that live among us . When policewoman  s sister apparently suicide , the two team up and discover a conspiracy beneath the surface of their native . often for his acting , and for good reason - he  s rubbish . He his way through the film , giving the very same nonchalant emotion to every scene and event that he comes across . The good thing is that a downtrodden character like him , so it  s not as bad as it could have been ... but on the other hand , if a talented actor were given the role ; the film would have been much better .  s  Chain Reaction  - star , him again here , and pretty much does the same thing that he does - i . e . just  appear . You don  t go into a movie like this good acting really ; but this film  t have even have  acting ! The only performance I really was Peter in the role of Satan , and that only about five . The special effects are typically , and while it  s not the best of all time ; it  s imaginatively used and the movie with it  s main asset . It  s a shame that this film is a flop , as the film noir of the plot could really have something interesting , the subject of and always for fun ; and the recent run of comic book been quite impressive ... but impressive , this film is not , and on the whole I recommend giving it a miss .",0

"House of 1000 was well worth the wait . People were understandably a little of Rob Zombie  s debut as a director , but knowing myself that the man is a scholar of the modern horror movie and a raving himself , I had high of House . I was not disappointed . From the demented and hilarious opening sequence through to the and terrifying ending , Zombie  s first foray into direction and writing the world of cinema a much boot in the pants . Is it gory ? Well , yeah , it is , but it  s never gory in an absolutely horrific fashion . What  s such a pleasant surprise is that the movie , despite being a homage to the bleak and nihilistic 70s horror boom , is full of well - painted , full - bodied and rich dark humour . House of 1000 is an absolute blast to watch , never in darkness and only really becoming a terror - ride toward the very end , meaning it  s a movie that while not for all the family could well put a smile on at least some of their . The combination of gore - soaked serial - killer horror , and Evil Dead  s sense of humour is a fresh turn from a genre currently stuck largely in bleak apartment full of long - faced pouty and even longer - faced pouty . Yeah it  t that tense , but it  s wickedly funny , wonderfully and chock full of demented set - . To be honest , I  d almost forgot what it was like to be by horror before I watched this . A lot of people love to dissect this movie and venerate it  s , but the bottom line is unlike Kill Bill which on you being as as to enjoy it , Zombie  s movie is fun whether or not you  seen the he his threadbare circus hat to . It  s a warped , delve into mania that  make you laugh out loud and keep you on the edge of your seat . Watch it . Watch it .",1

"I saw the trailer for this a while back and immediately thought it rubbish . Another by the horror film following the usual and ultimately leading to the usual , drab , gore - fest . How wrong I was ! Off the back of a Mark review in The Observer I thought I would give it a crack - particularly as my  s a horror fan and I to redeem the genre after suffering her making me watch Creep . The plot is basic and from numerous other horror . Group of  with  get trapped in dark place with nasty there out to get them . However , the way the material is on screen you constantly on the edge of your seat , repeatedly , however the are , and cringing away from the fairly gruesome gore . One scene in particular when the group use the infra red setting on a to check everyone is had the entire cinema ( myself ) screaming - an experience completely new to me and a real pleasure to endure . The pace is very cleverly set , with a slow , but never boring , build up of menace as the  s situation from bad to downright hellish , before in a finale that will leave you , breathless and absolutely of the dark . I have never ever had the desire to go , but now would probably go so far as to sit through Hollow Man , Vertical Limit AND Weekend at  s before below the earth  s crust into a dark hole .

"NOTE : galore in this post . I was really disappointed with this movie . I was a decent science fiction movie , instead I got a hacked up attempt at a - fi action / romance combination , with too many large that it spoiled the experience . The story is pretty straight forward . A group of people live in isolation after being told that they are the of some global catastrophe . They a mundane , but secure and physically fit life with that they will one day go to The Island , the last Utopian location on the planet . The main character , - 6 - Echo , the horrible truth ; the people are in some kind of prison and everything they  been told is a lie . Eventually he with Jordan - 2 - Delta and they discover that they are really of people in the  real world  that use the for body . They escape are on the run , then eventually return to free the other . The movie overall was good , it just had too many plot problem that just on me enough to spoil the movie in general : 1 ) The 2 escape from the compound with relative ease . Where is the security ? How come they are able to walk down a long access bridge to freedom with NO ONE spotting them ? They already fought security ; no one is able to keep on their position ? 2 ) The main supposedly have the education of 15 year and they supposedly have almost NO knowledge of the  real world . Yet once they get to a train station and then to , they don  t seem to have any getting around . I mean , they act stupid and don  t know like  the can ,  taking a dump ,  dude  and act incredulous around this . Yet they don  t seem to have a problem around a metropolis , which to them would be an alien environment . 3 ) The main get by with 5 worth of luck . They dodge trained military personnel . Survive from a skyscraper of in the air and manage to take out a helicopter while doing so . They are in a car when it ( cut in half !!) after getting side - by an armored truck and walk away , not even dazed . I found it hard to empathize with the when they were in  danger  because they to be invulnerable ! 4 ) with . This is a pet peeve of mine . are NOT a part of a structure . A clone is simply a copy of a physical make up . It cannot have the experience and of its donor , because the clone itself  t had those or . Yet frequently portray a clone as not only the same physical as a donor , but the same as well . Although , in this movie , the were mostly  subconscious . 5 ) When Jordan was brought back to the institution towards the end , NO ONE thought to search her for a weapon ?!! 6 ) During some of the big action ( fighting with the while and the big highway chase scene with the flying attack ) the camera kept shaking and it was hard to see what the heck was going on . Whats the point of seeing a movie , when the movie * itself * it difficult to see what is on the screen ?! As the movie went on , these just keep until by the end , I just to see the end . As a side note , I that this movie was almost identical to together two other : Run and . The movie a man and a woman on the run , leaving an isolated society and the world outside , only to return and  free  the people from the society ( Run ). Meanwhile , they are on the run and down by , because their are actually by some rich person ( ). Overall , I give the movie a 4 out of 10 . I would give the movie a 7 out of 10 for just the story , but this is reduced for the annoying I previously .",1

"I have to admit that I had really high of this movie , Bale was the perfect candidate to revive the Bat franchise , surely had something fresh to bring to the ( we will never forgive you ).

"Yes , . That  s what you  be doing at the back of the theater , your head , your tongue hanging out , as you watch this week  s Marvel - comic - book movie ,  Fantastic Four . was my favorite comic book back when I was a wee lad . These were Lee  s original with  of clay  ( even before Spider - man ). But the real heart of the comic was the Thing ( Ben )-- the big , tough wise guy with the big broken heart . And he is the one thing the movie got right -- ( and the impressive make up ) capture the Thing perfectly . Unfortunately there are three other team , who need to be  : Reed ( . Fantastic ), Sue Storm ( the Invisible Girl , er , Woman ), and Storm ( the Human Torch ). Ah , for the old comic - book origin story , where the four are shot up into space , are exposed to  cosmic , crash back to earth , and immediately start their super . Before you know it , they  re fighting the Mole Man ( and sometimes each other ). If only the movie had used such shorthand . Instead , well over half the flick is  family  as the Four discover their -- and the origin of . Doom ( their enemy ) is outlined . Doom is the movie  s most serious misstep . In the comic , Doom was a scientist who from the  pure faith  ( yes ,  he in God  s domain , to lift a bit from Wood  s  Bride of the Monster ). He had a regalness and grandeur about him , even as he tried to destroy the and take over the world ( the perfect opposite of Reed ). In the movie , Doom is another tiresome industrialist who ( ala  Green Goblin  ) super . His showdown with the at the end is somewhat less than epic ( and the climax off a bit of  Terminator 2 ). The whole movie as though they shot a first - draft script ( fairly trip over the loose , and Reed is about as much of a super genius as Wile E . Coyote ). But there is the occasional chuckle , usually thanks to Bashful Benjy .",1
"Apart from the cloying pretension of the entire script , the , the often frighteningly amateurish acting , and the fact that apparently gazing emptily into the camera some soul - stirring information on the nature of the character he , this film is very poorly done even on the most basic of film - making . Witness the repeatedly blown ( for example , where the hell is he looking when the cop him over on the motorcycle ?), horrid and shot selection , and abysmal ... Some people have been giving this film a pass , saying  not bad for a effort , or even  really what he  s doing behind the camera . Well , as someone who  s gone through a graduate film program , I can tell you , this IS bad for a first - time effort ; does not seem to know much about what he  s doing behind the camera ; and many of the in this film would not be acceptable in a student film , much less a feature . 2 really me . One , how the hell did he get Holm to show up ? Does he have of him naked with a sheep or something ? Two , and this is them kind of precious garbage that me in like this , good thing there  s a vintage era motorcycle lying around in the garage , complete with sidecar , because , y  know , it really . While saying nothing at all about character or story .

I am at an utter loss to explain this film  s 8 out of 10 rating , except to posit that those raving over how deep this film is are the same sort of self - involved , self - pitying spoiled rich white from Jersey , or similar environs , who seem to share .  s conceit that their commonplace and often trivial constitute the stuff of tragic melodrama .

"War of the is one of my favorite movie . This really good . I think this movie will get for best movie of the year . And best director and best producer of the year . And also might get best actor of the year !!! because acting was awesome . And Steven done a great job . I would be very happy if Steven another movie  War of the 2 . I cant wait to see the next movie of Steven  s another adventure and action movie which is  Park 4 . People should vote 10 for this movie !! People should go to the movie theater and watch this movie ! I want to watch it again and !",0
"I  t get the point of the movie ! The lady becomes this great boxer then , she becomes a . Now she to die , so her coach the plug . , I  t find this movie entertaining at all . It had no point . You are thinking that the girl is win some huge fight and the she  t . Oh , and her big , fat , stupid mother , I just want to clank her in the face . The boxer girl buy her mother a house , but the mother is worried about losing her welfare so she  s screaming at her for getting her this house . This part really ... whatever .

"I  seen it a couple of days ago and I it !!!! I thought D could never play Willy as good as Gene Wilder did in the old version . Actually i thought it would be a rip - off of some kind that it would be just the same as the old one but with new . I was wrong . I went because a friend and I to go to a movie but there  t something really exciting in the cinema close by so alright , why not , it  s a nice day for a movie so we  just go . We a lot because it was pretty funny . I think D did great . It  s not like the old version , they  a lot . I saw it in dutch because it  t play in yet , normally I don  t like spoken in dutch but this time i did . Good movie . An 8 at least !!!!!",0
"I saw the movie this week and thought it was absolutely AWFUL !!! The acting be the lead character who payed the role of was atrocious . I have seen better acting in a play . His accent was unbelievable , I say this because I am born and raised in . The story plot was like a bite off of the life of Ice - Tea . The lighting was terrible and the rap in it was whack . This movie was worst than WOO with Smith . It is definitely not a movie to take your to see along with you . There is a lot of foul language that just  t hustle or flow for the story line . It was almost like watching a high school production . Yes , the movie was low budget , but it was also low quality .",0
"This movie was flat out hysterical . It brought me back to the good old days before there was so political correctness . This of like , Trading , Vacation and . Great funny R - rated comedy . Some people have written that the movie is and unrealistic . These people need to lighten up - its a comedy and a straight man being hit on by a creepy gay guy while being tied to the bed is funny particularly when that straight guy is . The midnight rape / naked homo art show rant from is hysterical along with the scene when they are hunting quail ( I  m !!! Let  s go some ). There are many other that were also ridiculously funny . Sure the movie did not make sense at times , but it is a comedy - just enjoy it . My only gripe was that the movie was too long . It was about 2 and it some of the stuff towards the end should have been cut out . There are far worse to see ( War of the anyone ) then this and you will definitely laugh .",0
"For once , I was glad that I randomly picked a movie at the spur of the moment . I was at the cinema with one of my best and three other . The task of a movie was assigned to me . But seeing that I haven  t been catching up with listing for nearly 6 , I found it a tough job . Summer really was of attention - movie . My were turned off by the title of this flick itself , The Island . I mean , seriously , who would want to watch a movie  The Island , especially when they have no idea what is it all about in the first place ? If it  t for the brief printed summary at the counter , I would not have given this movie a second glance . Like War of The , its poster was not self - explanatory . Plus , I did not watch the trailer prior to my trip to the cinema . BUT , unlike War of The ( or any other before this ), for once I did not question the logic of the flow of the . The was good enough for me to not stop and start being a cynic . At the very least , that the average viewer might ask about the plot are . It was 100 % NOT boring and the plot in this movie was subtle because of the relatively fast pace of the story growth . In fact , though I had only watched it once , I don  t remember any noticeable loop in the . Or questionable action for that matter . I  t if there were futuristic in the movie . After all , the whole thing took place in the future . It was nice that it blended in with the contemporary of the current world , all so that everything realistic . Now , there is humor here and there , blended in nicely with action and drama . Noticeable humor are satire , sarcasm and banter . The director , Bay , cleverly with  human  innocence in the movie . The whole innocence thing somehow me of how complex our have made today to be . How open the of those   are to different , to many of us in reality . Six Echo , and that was what made the difference . That manner me of Dead Society , another good movie . Needless to say , and each other well . This is the first time I watched in action , and I must say , her character development as Jordan Two Delta was good . It was more noticeable than  s part . Six Echo was as a skeptic to start with , whereas Jordan Two Delta was very innocent . On the other hand , I was quite that took up this role as I was quite with his role as Obi Wan in Star and Catcher Block in Down With Love . After all , Six Echo is more of a character of innocence , curiosity , and mischief , just like a confused child . Nevertheless , it was a refreshing brilliant performance of . If I were to complain about anything at all , it would be that I  t manage to buy popcorn because of the long line at the food counter . I don  t think people who are just looking for entertainment with depth would complain about this movie . In conclusion , I definitely want to watch this again .",1
"I really the sneak preview of Must Love Dogs . Although I was definitely a member of the male minority at the preview , this film is not for only . The film dogs , drinking with , a guy on a date with three at the same time at the same table . Lane is very convincing in her role as a beautiful woman who is not sure what her next step in life should be .  s role to be one that he many times ; that of the man in love with the perfect woman who bad luck .( Serendipity , Hot Pursuit ) His character is not as as Lane  s is . The film you get to know Lane  s character but  s character leaves a few like how does he pay his ? The supporting cast is wonderful with too many memorable funny to mention them all . There is also an exposure to poetry that is quite refreshing in this era of catchy slang movie dialogue .",0
"I  t stand the first film adaptation of  s book , so I was a bit reluctant to see the one . I ended up loving every second of it . It  s hardly disturbing at all , and crazily fun to watch . Even the were cool . I totally recommend this movie and give it nine out of ten ( the missing star is for the continuity , which thankfully  t very noticeable ). does a great performance as Willy , and I was very overall with the  dark atmosphere  that Burton  s gave to it . Dark , but not disturbing or scary -- that  s the way to do it ! There  s even some humorous to lighten the mood . Needless to say I out with a craving for chocolate .",0
"I will star by saying that i have not seen the original , the or read the book so i may be out of my depth on this , on the other hand i can take an unbiased view . The previous / Cruise picture Minority Report , while unsuccessful in the box office was a solid film with a good story and great effects . This one however was at a much bigger audience , being based on such a famous novel . on famous is a brave move and often it as u have to pay more attention to detail to keep the fan happy , however i  t know the story so went into this with an open mind trying not to be by the . The first hour of this film went really well , it you in to the plight of Cruise and his on there mission to get away from the awe inspiring , the effects were brilliant the acting solid and the pace of the film relentless , although there were a few ( you  know what i mean if you watch it ), i found myself getting involved with the film , is a master at this . However the second half is not so good , with schmaltz galore and the pointlessness of character , combined with a completely flat ending made the first half a waste of time building up to a massive disappointment . Maybe instead of a remake , a film based around the earth , with which war of the was an obvious template and paying to the original would have .",1
"I start by saying how it me how people think they can be hyper critical of what is and always was be a popcorn flick ! Why do you feel that you have to complain about the , cinematography , lighting , hairdresser ... A popcorn film is supposed to be fun not serious so take it more lightly . Anyway on to the film , i remember the cartoon series of this which , while extremely , was a good giggle and extremely tongue in cheek , i feel the film this very well . My one complaint was Doom and how the character was poorly , unlike the Fantastic Four , we barely seen the of Doom . The were really good and the scene on the bridge was awesome , even to the superior and Batman , in which this amount of effects would not have been out of place . The the effects used for the thing but personally i am happy that it is a man in a suit as to a blob . The film does take on the usual  first in a franchise  feel of character development over plot but i for one would happily watch a sequel if it out with as much fun as this . i o give this film 7 . 5 / 10 but could only officially rate it 7 / 10 as opposed to round up to 8 / 10 as this is a popcorn flick not a ageless classic !",1
"I  t too happy when I that Burton was WILLY , or should I say , re -  s book AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY , and the initial  t make me feel any better . But , I went to see it with an open mind , and was pleasantly . At first . The first twenty are great . The introduction of all the is often hilarious , even surpassing the original movie at times . Violet and Mike are somewhat re - vamped , while and are basically identical , but the who play them are all very funny . But when we finally get to the Chocolate Factory , immediately go downhill . There are some amusing effects and cool set design , but the spirit of the original movie , and  s original story , are absent . The movie just from one bigger , more elaborate version of the original set - to the next , with no inspiration and no new spin .  s portrayal of Willy is mind - . What is this character supposed to be ? An adult child ? A shut - in ? Or just a generic ? nothing to the character , he just like .  cousin and a lot of funny , somehow to come off as wooden . Gene Wilder the character like a mysterious genius who knew more than he was telling his . the character like a goofy buffoon who  s simply a poor host . The actor who all of the - is funny for about one minute , then that joke increasingly tiresome . By the time he  s dressed up like a rock star doing , it  s just plain stupid . The screenplay is very lazily written . pop up in the story which then go nowhere , such as Violet and a private glance at the mention of Ever - Lasting , but then nothing coming of it . It  s as though the writer decided to get rid of anything he felt was extraneous to the plot ; in other , he to get to the next special effects sequence quickly , and keep that pesky plot as bare - to - the - as possible . It  s obvious the feel that their audience flashing and pretty colors , not an interesting story . And that is the problem with AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY . There  s no shortage of to look at , but once the novelty of that off , there  s nothing more to it . Even a subplot Lee as  s father is thrown in almost as an afterthought , then aside as soon as it  s its purpose . Like so many , there  s a lot of and - jumbo , but no soul . The best I can say for AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is that it is better than Burton  s PLANET OF THE . Then again , so was PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE .",0
"My four year old totally to get into this movie - from about half way through , he kept how much longer it was , and could we go home ? is mildly funny for ( at least in its New York ), but there  s far to much rapid verbiage and the suffer from too much angst for small to really be interested . Some of the slapstick made my son laugh , and he was occasionally , but he really  t care at all for the . Neither did I - they  re just not very likable . For me , the movie would have been much better if they  d removed the four altogether , and concentrated on the . Give this one a miss .",0
"Burton the mark ... again . Here is a story that it to me would be difficult to ruin : a  s movie about magical chocolate . The movie off well enough . We are to  s family and town and learn about the Chocolate factory . The finding of  s ticket to visit the factory slowly towards its inevitable conclusion . This is my first complaint that the finding of the ticket was not but as if desire can influence reality ( remember , you can win the lottery so long as if you really , really want to win ). . So what . It  s forgivable . The story on and we find ourselves on a tour of the factory . For a while are fine and then with one new plot device -- the elevator -- go completely downhill . Now effects rather than character take over the story ( I don  t call them special effects because it  s not often that they  wow  us ... they are ordinary effects ). The also act completely unnatural during some of these ( i . e ., the and just sit back and watch barely concerned as their do dangerous ). Anyway , the movie goes on until the end . There  s no point about it except the most of moral  your family is important . The in the theater a few times ( but not as much as they have the potential for ). As an adult , I twice . Once was at a pretty good joke , I must admit , about what  s edible . The other was at something that  t intended to get a laugh . Oh , regarding , what a strange dude ! He  s got ... real .",1
"This movie strong and good . The script was full of suspense and great of human nature . Then I  m not sure what . It  s like a in and said  where  s the ?  where  s the unbelievable chase where the two come out unscratched ? Perhaps it  s only half a movie . I would love to read the original . I would love to see what the writer intended , because the writer that wrote the first half of this flick did not write the second half . Bay is always filling with action and the story that make you think . During the car chase I was thinking ,  god do I have to laundry , when will I actually get to do it . A good flick will not let your mind drift . It will present for the viewer and stick with you through the next day . After the this flick we it at subway , getting dinner and soon it . The potential this film had was great , and lost it in the . and are wonderful and so is the rest of the cast . But when you  re told to withhold suspension of disbelief , there  s only so many close you can forgive .",1
"Is it the writing ? The acting ? The message ? Whatever the reason , I found myself right away for the two in this tale . We first meet and as docile of an idyllic futuristic society . Once the stage is set , the pace up as the true nature of their world is revealed , and they take to save their own and bring justice to their community . White - knuckle on every imaginable type of vehicle are anchored by the pair  s convincingly transformation to emotional maturity . A sweet love story , a thrilling action picture -- what more could you ask for ? Actual thought ! In a world facing ethical human embryo research , the film  s message that , however , human are human , is powerfully . Parental warning : This film extremely violent , almost all necessary for the communication of the message of the movie , but disturbing - even , in the case of a young mother and of  s character , heartbreaking . This film is NOT for .",0
"I don  t truly understand why the of action are not filling the to see The Island . It two of the better / of our time in and and us an amount of action that can make most smile . At the same time the story line is actively yet not complicated in any sense of the imagination . Bay finally came through in his movie to date yet this movie only in 12 million on it  s opening weekend . It is a disgrace to see such as Wedding outperform the Island this past weekend . That me that people are more interested in watching two horny full grown men invade a wedding to get some over a movie where there is a great story with depth involved . I would talk about the movie and some of the amazing but to do that would ruin the movie for many . Just know that the movie is set in the future and the technological the movie us are outstanding . The special effects are top of the line as most Bay seem to be . It to me that The Island is either going to completely bomb at the box office ( which it  t ) or will become a hit because of word of mouth . What will surprise most people if they take the time to see this movie is it does not completely revolve around gigantic or sex . Instead this movie on the life of two people and their fight for survival in a world that we would not even be able to comprehend if we had to experience it ourselves . All I am saying is look at the bulk of the for this movie . Most people have given it a rating of seven or higher meaning it is a very good movie to say the very least . If you spend eighteen to see this movie with your significant other you will not feel like you were out of your money . Instead when you leave you will wonder what it would be like to live in a world that these two people have to experience .",1
"Take a look at  s performance in  Crash , and then go see what he does in  Hustle & Flow . The guy does all the little ( and big ) a film actor to do to be credible . Not only that , he an absolutely screen presence . If he  t become a major , winning and along the way -- as opposed to the kind of status of , say , Cruise or one of the other lightweight pretty -- then we  know once and for all that the system is totally . Hustle & Flow ? I went to it the night it in , the buzz about it in on and in the Times . I was somewhat skeptical , yet I bought my ticket with an open mind , I  d be , enlightened , . Maybe what I really was something other than the Big Production Crap that the major turn out so routinely . I  t disappointed . Because  Hustle & Flow   t overwhelm me with effects . Instead it got me involved in a story about some downtrodden yet ever hopeful . Brewer  s script crackled with wit , pathos , hope and rage , and his direction was blessed by so much verisimilitude that the part of he intended to portray almost visceral on the screen , tiny ( of smoke from a cigarette , of sweat , the oily on an old fan ) to the back story . Brewer  s casting were inspired . ( ) will get all the  star  play , but he  s got some terrific support in Manning ( ), P . ( Shug ), Parker ( ), ( Key ) and ( ). All in all , this is a  don  t miss  film . A breakout by its writer / director , star and cast . Will it win big in this year  s ? Hard to say . It should , in my opinion . One thing is sure ... it  s infinitely better than the  5 . 9  rating it  s been given up to this point in time . Almost forgot ... all hail Singleton for the film !

"First I must start out by saying  Willy and the Chocolate Factory  is my all time favorite movie . There I said it , now talk about this Luke warm attempt at a re - make . , the don  t do him justice , but he does give Willy a creepy quality . The movie off really wonderfully , I was excited to hear the when there was no golden ticket and when there was . It me a warm fuzzy to hear those innocent to story they haven  t yet . So that said .... The factory . Burton can not tell a story or convey the magic of the original . He even said in an interview he never the original and also to remake the story . He needs to go back and read the book and find the story . His are boring and uneventful . His are lost and unlikeable . Unlikeable , but we really don  t care what whether their good or bad . A friend summed up this movie in a nutshell .  Image visiting a house you grew up in , it  s been and new people live there , and you just feel awkward being there . I can  t recommend seeing this flick , because it just to keep and classic . Just look at this summer  War of the World ,  Willy ,  Bad News ,  ,  ,  Wax Works  . There  s slump in the box office , according to , and it  s because of this rehash trash .",1

"I think everyone who seen this movie would agree with me , Billy Bob was the only good aspect to this film . The were terrible at acting , they made it seem like they were reading off a the whole time . There were very few funny , and the like nothing but potty mouth little . The original is way better , the performance I saw by Walter in the original got me very excited because Billy Bob always a good drunk , but in this film Billy Bob was just too nice most of the time , so his character was a little too dull . If you enjoy baseball then you might enjoy this , but I doubt even the biggest Billy Bob fan would give this 2 up ...",1

"I really this film . First a comment on the acting : - SO nice to see he won  t get type - cast , since he does many different . He  s a great actor and at least 2 sides of his wide spectrum of character . He  t seem to have one awkward acting moment in this movie . He make it great . - She really blossomed and ( or whatever ) into a beautiful and talented and enjoyable actress with more depth than you might , at first , imagine . She was able to aptly harness the of someone who  s both naive and savvy at the same time . Plus she  s gorgeous and her facial say it all . - Yet another fine performance , ! You never disappoint . - Stepping out of his  normal  nicely . First to see it in and it  s nice to see him in a role that  t necessarily HAVE to call for an . He  s a great talented actor and well this role variation . He  s more than his to . Not that he  t do that call for a strong  guide - type role in , as well . Bean - Did a great job in this film too . Like , he to do a fine job in every movie he  s in . It  d be nice to see him do a different type of character . Nonetheless , was perfect for the role he in this movie . Direction : The and camera shot for a particular emotion was covered very professionally . The acting talent was expertly enhanced by really good direction in this film . I have that I  t like in this film ( albeit some were very unbelievable , but in an enjoyable way ). !!!! The scene falling from that building , riding a large sign ( letter  R ) was very far - fetched by very thrilling . However , the  really you ! comment was extremely hilarious . I also the scene where was watching her  sponsor  on that commercial for and watching  herself  kissing someone , never experienced that for herself . Then the way she touched her own . It was a very special moment in that film .",0
"As a Potter fan , the world is a rather sad place to be hanging around . It  s a matter of principle , no more , no less . The refuge one may find in the is comforting in an enchanting way , but can the be so as well ? After watching  s one and two , nay was all that I could say . Both were somewhat down in quite a few and despite only in from the , they both the tremendous performance of boring me to a paralysis - like state . Surely enough , there were I , but reality and fantasy two separate : you can  t get a Harry Potter without taking him from the world and the world simply needs time to learn and to grow up . And they did , all of them , those little , all for Harry  s sake and under  s guidance ! What 3 a much more enjoyable ride is the sense of existence with which the are finally . They are leading a life of their own and the finally learned how to show that on screen - obviously , with  s help , who was more than able to reinvent  s universe in a way only a true visionary could  done .  t up to the task , for all that in his case was the frame and not the painting itself ! It  s very important to be able to guide and the only real way to do it is by making it feel natural . So did . The third book is probably the best one to film due to the plot , mainly . That  s one of the why it out so well as a movie . But the fact that the have to grasp the basic of acting and the stunning create a new world for us to taste have had an undeniable positive influence upon the end result . This new film is good because it finally the spirit of the book : the innocent hope , the complicated of life ( and death ), the which make us tick the way we do . It  s a step in who the heck you really are , who the heck Harry is and what he is becoming . The  wise of Dumbledore  are always powerful and mysterious , in the sense they really should be . And it  s good this way , because there so much more behind them and we want to want to be . That  s what to do , he a world which leaves enough unanswered as there can be . Finally someone who the essence of the book . Finally something fresh and exciting . That  s the way is supposed to be !",1
"I have to say that this movie  t all it was said to have been . There was not enough action ; the action  t include every every single scene in the movie , despite the , being and killing them and the seem helpless to prevent it . You have the big scene in the beginning where the first arrive , and that is how the movie should have been situated . After that there should have been a solution to how to stop the . It  t even live up to the name of War of the . This whole thing was one sided . It was very entertaining , I  grant that , but for a movie , I was a little disappointed . In my opinion , Independence Day is beat by a long shot . Cruise was decent , Fanning was superb , and gave a nice side effect . All in all , I gave it a six out of ten .",1

"Just caught this one and I  m still a bit . I really  t expect very much of it at all , and was a bit concerned about the idea of it straight . Part of the reason why Dog worked so well was it  s very sense of humour , and without that I thought The Descent would flounder . Turns out I was very wrong indeed . Where the film most is simply by the out of you . The whole cinema was wincing and along with the cast , and there is an emotional depth that I  m  t been made more of . , so the cast are a little too photogenic for their own good , but then I suppose this is the . I don  t think we  d care quite so much if got stuck in a cave . I suppose the only potential minus point ( selling point if you wear black , listen to nu metal and manage to combine a comfortable middle class background with like , so totally yourself ) is the degree of bone crunching violence ( literally ). There is a great deal of blood . But ... the film was quite restrained for the genre in that 1 . Everyone stayed pretty much fully for the entire movie 2 . There was none of this psychological / physical torture crap that everyone to feel obliged to put in anything even vaguely horror related these days ( , be very ashamed . Only , love you really !

"The plot and dialogue are so forced that is was stressful to watch . Most important , the complete and utter lack of chemistry between Lane and - cast the viewer hope that they don  t get together -- for everyone  s sake ! This is just another movie about a fretting , 40 - desperately seeking romance while moping around the house in her  s . I lost count of how many times someone told Lane ,  you  re so beautiful  and  you deserve so much more . Give me a break ! is capable of so much more than this neurotic character had to offer . Also , if I had such a meddling family , I  d put myself up for adoption ! Rather than being  cute , the family force was simply annoying .

In of imagery its everywhere - wild and deadly in mood against a backdrop of blood . Everyone the definitive take on the subject is The Blob but this is a close second . Saturated in horrid , imagery its a to the of the flesh - those that build to a bloody crescendo at a certain time .

BATMAN the movie .... the film with a young and innocent and its not long until you see why he ended up bats they way he did and as the film you get to see the reason why his are and what affect this on as he up full of hate and unforgivingness , as a result the globe in the hope that he will learn to understand the common criminal and therefore know how to combat them , and this is where he into who him the ways of the and other ways also in  evil  and you can guess the rest . the trick to this film is that you don  t get to see batman at all for about an hour and the wait is really worth it , you get the lot in this movie ... humour , sharp serious dialogue , great action , great and acting ... but again the only down side to this movie is that pesky camera work in the fight and it really me and made me feel a little dizzy at times , but when you look at the film as a whole you do tend to forgive this one and only discrepancy !!! he he .................. 9 / 10 for the film and would have been 10 but for the camera work . BATMAN / ... where this man been he he , been a fan of for a wee while now and i was looking forward to him this , but i  t how effective he would be , as the educated and rich / business man he this off with such a grizzly swagger and realistic charm you just have to love the guy ... i am so glad that bale was aloud to play the character as dark as he did , with so much conviction and because of this you really feel the hate / confusion that very deep through him ........ awesome ! 10 / 10 for me ! the butler ..... ever been more to a character than ??? i find it very hard to find any that come close , the only other one is probably peachy from  the man who would be king ) with , the humour is bang on and really the dialogue with real exuberance and is a delight to watch , witty , sentimental , and the look of a real butler you could believe to be ...... 10 / 10 again . ..... it is very rare when you get a performance so perfectly down as this , if you are a regular at the cinema then you will have no him but if you  re not you could very easily miss him altogether . as the typical family policeman who is just trying to survive in what is a real crap hole of a city in  city  where most of the are corrupt and the quality of people living there a quite to say the least ..... you don  t get the usual here and just occasionally i would like to have seen just a little bit more of the actor i know and though i  t get it i his character all the same ...... 9 / 10 /  S AL ....... is consistently showing some REAL heavyweight in at the moment and this is just another feather in that bow , for the first hour of the movie nearly all the best had him in them , and was by far a better villain than any of the other batman in previous put together .... this was a man with real and real hatred for corruption and lawlessness and his conviction in this movie made me go WOW on more than 1 occasion he he ..... what a towering impression he when he is being forceful especially during the sword fighting .... awesome .... apart from sounding a bit like - Gon Jinn in some ( still cool just too familiar if thats the right way of it ) he was cock - on !! 9 / 10 MORGAN FREEMAN ... though this guy is always reliable he was never to shine as much as you hope for in this , purely because his character  t that big but what you do get you just know you like ... he he . / director .... well , well , well ! this is excellent , the pace of the movie is spot on , the feel he you with both the scenery and the dark harsh city is quite exquisite . you do get lots of at like side profile and the use of these with over the and body give you the sense of that you are watching a very dark and gritty movie and right from the get go you know that this is never be like the as we know them ! the only gripe i have is the use of extreme close up camera work when you get the on the go , i know they want you to feel like you  re in e the fight but by doing this you lose the beauty of the the action scene and choreography between the . because of this i will go 9 / 10 i hope this is useful to some people and i URGE YOU ALL TO SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE ITS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT ...... its much better !!",1

The effects are alright , the acting from bad to so so ( with the occasional good performance from Ben a . k . a .

"Firstly I don  t understand some saying that it could have done with more action . These days it is the kiss of death to be just another movie as there really is nothing new to see . The were all pretty true to the apart from Reed who , although to his work , was never a geek . Doom was also a bit weak ( character wise ) for me . Linking up and the Thing was one of the worst - A blind babe it off with a big orange lumpy guy within 2 of meeting him and then at the end he he  s fine as he is ! He  s either more blind than she is or else he  s gay . One thing that I miss from the is the ludicrously huge  mad scientist  of both Doom and where a the average piece of equipment was the size of a small building and like it could blow up a planet or two . Overall I it right up until the final battle with Doom which had no element of suspense whatsoever .",1

I  t a fan of Frank Miller  s Sin City , I was just a casual reader back in my comic - book days , but I clearly remember a lot of and that I read , and still have them fresh in my mind .  s Sin City I am just speechless . It  s a beautiful film in a very violent \u0096 for a film \u0096 package . This is the way this material was to be done . All of the are like a trash can where you can reach into and find something beautiful inside . I have these clear of  s story from the in my head , and the way it  s done here Gee , it  s astonishing .

There is lots of good back up ( perhaps a little short ) from big like , and a certain Frat pack member who all benefit from the script spreading humour across all .

"Lane ( lead character  ) is wonderful , as always - a breath of fresh , and authentic , air in this quite predictable , but still lovely , romantic comedy . One of   s  love ,  Jake , is by , who a little less present in his role , but is adorable enough to overcome whatever is in his performance ; I hoped for a little more   laser focus romantically speaking , but did find of it in his yearning and obsession with the movie  . . Among the other story out by an impressive supporting cast ,  s is my favorite ; the vulnerability she as she for love in middle age is quite touching . Plummer was fine in his role as  s widowed father by a plethora of single golden . is fun to watch , though I think that too much is revealed too soon about his character ( Bob / Bobby ) to keep the mystery alive in his relationship with  .  character is my least favorite - more , , or a clearer back story would make her character more compelling .

"Ray Ferrier is a New Jersey man working on the , living alone , from his ex - wife and two . and come to stay with him for the usual few days and none of them are particularly happy to see one another . However their visit is up by an intense electromagnetic storm that is powerful , exhilarating and exciting . What nobody could have known though is that the are only cover for an invasion of an alien species , after all , the must be a million to one of such an event . As the alien craft rise out of the ground and begin cutting an unstoppable swath across the world , Ray his and the city \u0096 not sure where he is going but just to survive long enough to work something out . With the involved in this film you could be for something more than just a blockbuster film and , in some ways you  d be right but then in almost as many ways you  d be wrong . In many ways this is better than a normal effects blockbuster , but mainly this is down to the fact that , since 9 / 11 , few want to launch a massive film that pleasure in death and destruction in the way that Independence Day did . Instead this is much and more effective for it \u0096 and tension than if it had been made with just spectacle in mind . It still the goods in that but the effects are used well , of destruction as well as a particularly impressive scene where the camera around a moving car in a way that would be impossible without . The downbeat and dark presentation that there is more to this film that effects and I was to look into the subtext as I watched it . Here I  t find much of interest and perhaps I was trying to see that  t there . With the obvious awareness of real and , the film to promote  everyman for himself , sacrificial and other strange that the film can  t do anything with . Maybe I was too much and really there  t anything below the surface but if there was then it  t make a great deal of sense . this aspect though , the film still works well enough as a dark  alien invasion  film that and without the audience actually revel in or remain remote from the death and destruction . it moving well and the film an convincing feel ; darkness and light are used well and the are good , certainly making for a nice change from us watching the usual being \u0096 his focus is more on the people and real . For most of the film he to avoid the mawkish sentimentality that many of his but he it up right at the end ; the final few had me walking out of the cinema shaking my head . I  m not to the bacteria ending ( everyone knew that was coming ) but to the terrible family reunion scene that is so horribly corny and cheesy that it turned my stomach . Did we need it ? It smelt like a on ending from a test screening but part of me that is probably as guilty as anyone . For such a dark and destructive film it was a terrible ending and the previous 110 deserved much better . Cruise is pretty good but he is far from being the ordinary working Joe that the script him to be . He can do the action stuff well and he is well practiced in acting alongside special effects but he is not a New Jersey shoreman ! Fanning is as good as ever , convincing in her but again perhaps a bit too precious to be a  real  child . is as but his character made very little sense to me and he  t seem to understand what significance he either . The support cast are mostly screaming ; is quite good but and Barry  s are by the fact that they are involved in that terrible , terrible ending . As with all , the effects are the and they are worthy of the billing . Overall this is a good summer film that a post - 9 / 11 darkness and tone to it that some might find not quite conducive to enjoying the that the summer audience usually want . However I quite this approach and found it more engaging and . The effects are good and the fit in with them well but be \u0096 the cloying sentimentality of the last few is really hard to stomach and will leave you with a really bad aftertaste .",1

Personally , I make a point to see any movie that been by the pseudo - intellectual vermin . The certainly the call on this movie . Butler was outstanding in his rendition of The Phantom . Unfamiliar with his previous acting ability , Butler  s strong acting performance me to further inquire about his training and career .

The most exhilarating moment when The Phantom his lair near the end of the movie . I just what with respect to ( ) and a potential relationship with our suffering hero . The fact that she his mask , it up , and to follow after him up the following in my mind : I envision finding The Phantom , becoming his student , and becoming romantically involved with the latter . This would certainly be plausible when at the end of the movie we note the single red rose the ring returned by to The Phantom . In this way , I could believe that The Phantom some degree of happiness in his life . Regardless , the ending was simply touching and personally moving !

"wow !!! firstly i had a real high expectation for this film being that of my family were huge sin city . spent many days the cast and which they would include . three struck a chord .... as , the former boxer  t exactly my first choice as , especially after his role in once upon a time in ( stupid dog ). wood as , i just  t see past the , shallow i know . but i still remember the faculty . his speciality is ! lastly the point that the film would be made mostly , now i  m a fan of special effects as much as the next person but too much look like a genesis game . streets of rage instead of sin city . many of you reading this think I  m now the film but what I  m trying to say is that i was so .... WRONG !!!! is !!!! without a doubt there is no person on this Earth that could have done a better job . wood was just creepy and good on him , the noir effect on his glasses was divine . and finally the aspect was astounding . did a great job , one for frank miller and his to be of . in case you haven  t seen it , I  m it to all , comic book , ... everyone !!!!",1
"who is batman ? from now on it is without a doubt in my mind that bale is the ultimate batman . i know this is shocking to hear as was moody , dark and superb but bale something that no other screen batman had , the sense of rage , anger and the actually possibility of snapping emotionally like the original . Batman always he could snap , and bale , an expert at psychological ( , the machinist ) actually like breaking down in of the film . but this film is not just about bale . Bow down to the king of creepy , Murphy . what a change from the scruffy git in 28 days later to the smirking and outright shocking scarecrow . the first time scarecrow on screen the cinema near threw me from my seat . personally , i can  t wait to see him in red eye . then there is , humorous , confident , great acting ( as always ) and for the first time relaxed . is not some posh pompous servant but a helper , an essential part of the team which was in some of the . there are too many good in this film to mention , so i  leave it with this , marvel have got their work cut out !!!! BALE !!!!",1
"War of the was an enjoyable film . Its very entertaining and you involved throughout the entire movie . The ending was not the best . There were many in the story . If you watch the film , its awesome . But if you sit and think about what is going on through the movie and listen to the story , there are far too many . Personally , did a good job , but I more from him . Go see it for yourself and find out . But when you see it , pay close attention to the that are said in the beginning and see if they truly play out to add or take away from the actual film . I think the early some that are left false by the end of the movie .",0
"I recently saw the movie and I was very satisfied with the result of . work . Batman is one of the which many people have a relationship to , and the was ( and still is ) quite high . I think the and the have with the creation of a Batman who is up to date but at the same time the Batman we all know ( dark minded and lonely ). Further I will pay a huge tribute to the performance of Bale . I have been fortunate to see this great actor in the past and my conclusion , after seeing Batman , is that he is one of the best around . His ability to express different is just great acting and with the of , , , Morgan Freeman and this become one of the best superhero of all time . We can just hope for more .....",1
"2001 is a movie that up polemical . You almost certainly love it or hate with no one an opinion that into the middle ground . Ironically enough I gave it 5 / 10 which I thought this movie is average . I  t think it was an average movie - I thought it was a pile of pretentious pseudo intellectual garbage and a cinematic update of the parable about the New is there to enjoy about this movie narrative wise ? The first half hour is taken up with men in gorilla around a studio exterior throwing about , a sort of tea party on while the last half hour is taken up with a man funny inside a . Neither of these dialogue so this is a movie that is impossible to follow story wise . And before anyone me a message to explain what 2001 is about let me tell you I  m not interested , and besides you  re probably only yourself if you think it  s about anything . It  s something to stare at after you  a joint , that  s what its function is - Eye candy for the stoned Technically the movie much credit since the cinematography is rather impressive as are all the sound : mix , . The voice of is very and memorable and in this reviewer  s head long after seeing 2001 and to me not giving the movie a much lower mark . But it  s still a movie that a reputation that it  t deserve and is long , dull , pretentious and most of all out of ten",0
"Wedding was one of the I  seen in a long time . I it so much , that I actually took two different people and saw it twice . It slapstick humor with an interesting plot , and meaningful life , like love , friendship , and power . I it , and would recommend it to anyone . Some of the were downright hilarious . I know it done well at the box office , and to deserve to do so . It is a light , fun look at life which is entertaining for two of one  s time , and the leave the theater feeling , and upbeat .",1
"This is a terrific film . In a time when just utter garbage , this stood out and made me laugh , cry , and think . is extremely good and so are the . Biggest flaw was the ending . It  s not enough that people die and go to a fictitious  Neverland . All of us must continue to search for what ahead after death . Do heaven and hell exist ? This is always in cinema and that  s a cop out . Nevertheless , terrific film and one that is outside of  s horrible these days . Other great in search of the hereafter are  Ben ,  Million dollar Baby ,  Field of , . In all , I think  Finding NEverland  will hold a place in history , but it still the substantive depth of what when we die .",1
"What the enormous interest in a sports hero ? Why do sports set such a strong personal stake in the of their ? After all , little of any practical significance on such ; a winner won  t get his a raise or help send their to college . Why do sports have such an enormous , enduring appeal in human life ? The answer in a rarely aspect of sports : their moral significance . What athletic provide is a rare and crucial moral value : the sight of human achievement . To witness the cheating and decay ruined any possible hope of seeing Million Dollar Baby  s . Although I was made a morally correct decision , the movie was beyond repair .",0

"I almost out of this movie a couple of times but am glad that I stuck it out .

"With all the that are taking place in you would think that a great like Steven would either be too busy for or at least add something special to familiar material but this latest effort comes off ( at best ) as passable summer fare . This H . G . story out with a crane operator Ray Ferrier ( Cruise ) who his for the weekend while their mother Mary Ann ( Otto ) to Boston to see her .***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Ray  s are ( Fanning ) and ( ) and they naturally have a problem being with their immature father but all that with what to be the start of a lightening storm and lightening key on the ground . To everyone  s shock alien been buried underground for an unknown amount of time and now they  come to the surface and to disintegrate everyone ( and everything ) in their path ! Ray and his head out of town in what may be the only working car ( for the time being ) and soon figure out that the planet Earth is under attack . Ray is trying to head to Boston to find his ex - wife but along the way he the car to and also a strange survivalist ( ) who up being more of a threat than actual help . grew up in the 1950  s and like many of not only the numerous - fi that were made but of the  scare   duck and cover  that young were forced to view . many of both the original film and own story in the script such as the look of the tripod and the red weed . Like many other of his the theme of a home into the story and when Cruise  t trying to stay alive from an alien invasion he  s desperately to keep some sort of semblance of a family unit together . For the most part I was by what I on screen and both Cruise and Fanning give pretty good but I have to be honest and say that I  t by anything I saw . There were a few that me ( to some degree ) and the first to do with what the are concerning . They disintegrate people but they also use them for their blood ... can  t they make up their alien on what they want us for ? Before I even went to the theater I instinctively knew I would be disappointed by the appearance of the actual and I was but I did feel a chill whenever the giant made that mechanical sound . I also had to laugh when I saw how much terror and trauma Cruise  s character goes through in this film because regardless of what he been saying in the media about prescription and psychiatry I thought his character definitely to be put on anti - and to see a good shrink ! Fanning  s character so shaken that I expect her to spend the rest of her life in a rubber room in the hospital sucking her thumb in the fetal position . But aside , this is an entertaining effort that enough good to give it a recommendation and though it  s more in line with  Independence Day  than something classic like  Close of the Third Kind  this is still ( generally ) a fun film to view .",0
"I mostly to see this movie because I to see , since I  never seen her before . She was very beautiful and pretty convincing in her role , though not enormously so . I don  t think she  s one of our top , but she  t terrible either . I thought the guy who Batman  t very good looking . He this peculiar , overly narrow nose & flattish face . Why him ? His acting was pretty good , though . There was an awful lot of racing around in the movie , particularly in the bat - mobile . I found watching this a bit fatiguing . There were some positive of the movie . I particularly the guy who the only executive at  s company who is actually loyal to him . I also the training . Overall it  t abysmal , but I don  t know if it was the best way to spend a couple of of my time .",0

I  m not a religious buff of the catholic faith , but I agree with another comment , and that is , that even though may not stay true to the faith and a few - I the movie regardless ... or maybe in spite of it . I also  t feel that this film tried to beat me over the head with religion . Though , I the religious ... the , the idea of God , the depiction of the angel ( WOW ), the ; the ... the list goes on , were well done . And yes , the depiction of Hell too .

"The past week , I  read in many ( not even sure where at this point ) negative on this film on unimportant , like whether the force the use were incorrectly off or on at crucial . Or that they  re tired of Morgan Freeman  s voice as God ( he  s not God ; he of God and could just be a survivor this event later ; and now we  re this detail and missing the big picture ). I get the feeling some cheat themselves of a strong movie experience by looking for stuff like this throughout a film . The feeling in the first few is that this really is just another typical day , as seen from the perspective of Cruise  s character and his ( where it will remain for the entire film ). There  s nothing ominous in the air ( even the of strange weather project nothing bad ). It  s a day like last week and it will end as just another day . There  s that sameness to everything which all of the audience can relate to . Day after day , week after week , even year after year - nothing to really get excited about . When it , it  s a jolt . It with that weird lightning , for a few to build more tension , and then to Hell on Earth within a few more . If one were to describe one of those alien tripod moving past a couple of away , blasting with it  s death beam , it would probably elicit a laugh from , but there  s nothing funny about how it  s , to  s credit ; he  d learned his craft in this regard by the time of Saving Private  s beach scene . When Cruise around the corner , a small , almost mouse - like figure , a lucky survivor of the initial onslaught , all you feel is his fear , his shock , his helplessness . The even produce a bizarre musical sound , a deadly counterpoint to the we in  Close  produced by  s friendly ; here , the are sounding the death - knell of the human race . I must confess I  m not sure this intensity will come across so well on a small screen ; I saw this in a theater and they turn up the sound so high , a person walking to his car across the screen is intense . So you  re with Cruise and his the rest of the film ; all your are dead ; your other in other ? Maybe . You don  t know . Any minute now , you may be joining the dead . No , must be . Millions ? No , it  s too insane , too dreadful ! The first act , ending with Cruise walking back to his house , numb and covered in the dust of people , and then to escape in the only working vehicle , is the best sequence ; can  t really top it . But , the next few all come pretty close in a series of heart - . The one extended scene where , Cruise , the writer and all the were at a loss was being up with ; it just  t work and the picture down . And the ending ? The undoing of the along the same of the original climax of H . G .  novel and the  53 film version . The simply  t find a way to trump ( one of the science fiction of all time ) and why should they ? The alternative is the win , mankind is dead - that  s another film ( here , we stop at about a billion dead ). But , I  t agree with  s to his usual safety net and the audience off the hook by miraculously saving the son ( , there  s always a chance he could have , but this was a set - up ). This was a war , perhaps the most terrible war , and people don  t just pop up without a scratch after something like this , unless it  s a , well , a - type movie . , , even when you got it - for 90 % of the film - you lose it in the end . Now let  s all hug each other and wish away any more possible alien . Sigh .",0

It  s not a documentary , though it could have been , especially with today  s reality show craze . For a pimp movie , there was almost NO nudity , nor were there any sexual , which could have made it even better . This movie was more about the music , and it DID have a great , in fact , I think I  m going to get it .

"You just know that I  t wait until the opening next week - so , about a half & I went to the Sneak Preview Sat . night . EVERYONE the movie . The were hilarious . My all want to read the book now . They were with the writing and especially all the funny banter . We just had a great time and to quote a line from the movie .... ! Far be it that we would go to an opening without a little excitement . About half way the movie ( actually at the Thanksgiving dinner table ) - the ceiling fell out - no , really . We were at a multiplex cinema in Park , . Luckily we were sitting towards the rear - cause the MOVIE WAS ( bought our in advance on fandango ).... anyway ... all of a sudden - the ceiling ( ) were pouring down on us . To tell you the truth - we all thought we were under attack - Park is directly across the River from . We were relieved to find out that it was just ! structural damage . No one was hurt and NO ONE LEFT the theater . Too engrossed with the movie , so , after the initial excitement , the movie AND we were all given free to the theater ..... You can bet we will be at the opening as well . It was an evening full of theatrical . Anyway , it was great entertainment ~ our crowd all left on an upbeat note ... it  s a feel good movie .... .. definitely going to be a hit .",0
"I thought that and the Chocolate Factory was a highly enjoyable candy fun film . It was funny , delicious , and just an amazing visual affect movie that really made the people in the movie happy . someday will be nominated for an because he is just a wonderful actor . He really made the film sweet by showing how much he his family more than anything in the world . was good too but disappointing . He seen better but he was also funny in this movie . The were weird but it still was fine . They were just different then what I . I would have to say in the end that this was Burton  s best film for me . He really made almost a better and the Chocolate Factory with telling more of a story . He should keep up his family work . It certainly is great .",1
"This film was a jaw dropping thrill ride . I thought Steven proved he was back with this excellent film . Cruise gave a good performance as a father trying to protect his . It was a perfect role for him I though the father who  t know much about his role . Fanning is a superb actress too . She really can play a mature role at her age . She needs to win an at her age and continue to make . It will be interesting when she is older because she does so good when she is young . Steven  s direction and were awesome to me . He really made it fun ride and gave a more appealing attack of the movie to me . It made more sense to me then other Alien . I would recommend this movie to anyone who survival of a different kind and to anyone who just to sit back and think what would happen if were were .",0
"Batman is starting a new generation of Batman . This one if the best and it gave such a great beginning story to what to . Bale gave a very good performance . He is a good Batman and I hope to see him continue with other Batman because he proved himself to be one of the next leading men in this time . The supporting cast was excellent too . gave a great performance as always as the Butler . He really energy to a movie . Morgan Freeman too is good as always but his part to be bigger . He is one of my favorite and I thought he was good in this movie too . . She is another cute and sweet actress that I personally love to see in . The not so good First Daughter I thought was a good movie . She really a potential too . Batman is not to be . It is a good film and I am waiting for the next one ! :)",1

There are some great story to work with . I am really looking forward to a great run with this series -- and fully expect these to blossom going forward . I don  t see how they could have done much more without making a 3 - hour movie . Let  s kick even more butt in the to come . Great start Thank you",0
"supernatural thriller that is a major bore for the most part with a performance by , who is miscast in the main role and a screenplay that is as stupid as it can be . A lot been said about being the only good thing that this movie to offer and I will agree with that assessment because she does make you care about what is going on with the movie while you are trying to figure out a way to care about the dumb story that is being told .  s performance is much too rich and powerful for a movie like this and she you a reason to stick around while in essence there is no reason to even stay till the end . was a masterpiece to this and that was marginal decent for what it was at the very best . For  s rich and powerful performance , I give the movie two . If she were not in the movie , my rating would be in negative . \u0096 0",1
"I was going to give this a five like a number of other and seemingly did . It would have never dipped below because of the superb casting . De and Fanning are phenomenal . They make each other better , rather that conflict with one another . Even is very , very good in her small part . Amy , the , is decent , although clearly distant , while Baker and the guy who De  s character  s the house , Steven , are both weird , creepy , and coupled with the , are like in a cartoon . Unfortunately , I knew the ending already because I had read the spoiler thinking I  d never see this movie . Knowing the ending still did not fix the and unbelievably chilling and feel of this movie . Fanning with her dark hair style like a thirteen year old , with her out seven year - old - like blue is just freaky . At first I just thought the game was , but then I the therapeutic of it .  s career as a psychologist  t really ( in it is ) and he  t seem to be working after moving his daughter . The move comes after the  suicide  of his wife . The cycle in the beginning with an apparently struggling relationship between and his wife . You  see what to be coming , but you  also be by its real meaning . The bathtub in the new house are outstanding . How De there after is beyond me . You walk in to your daughter  s room and she  s wide awake and eyed , and talking about whom you  as an imaginary friend . It worse obviously , but not as you might imagine . By the end of the movie it tedious and it becomes clear how it will end . The theatrical version of the movie the best ending by far . It  s suggestive , yet clear , optimistic , yet alarmingly dark . It  s fitting and creepy . Fanning  s tiredness to make sense and it is made clearer in the ; moreover , the backfill on this story is great . With the exception of Young . I  t know the relationship between her and had gone that far , not to mention some  t seem entirely congruent . De may have been one of the only to pull this role off . He  s real , passionate , and a good dad . I believe in earnest that he is trying to help his daughter . His patience is off - the - wall amazing ( the psychologist in him ), yet he discipline when raising his daughter . Best of all he  t give up hope . I  d love more than anything to break down the  surprise ending  because it is when I feel De is at his subtle best , and Fanning her absolutely most desperate , and it works . works as Fanning  s doctor . She  t steal any scene and is such a presence on screen . She very well - as a comforting doctor . You have to look past this movie as a psychological thriller , although there are unresolved . It is a movie about behind themselves ( both and ) a very traumatic past . That is accomplished and it was more of the point of the movie . De at first old , but then to settle into his role , yet he sometimes with  s character . But I love as Young . This character to be strong , confident , yet not arrogant , while still being charismatic , and brilliantly that . She and work very well together . on the other hand is clearly going down the path of a death woman and won  t move on . All of these are why the ending and the movie is quite good , and I  given it a more befitting rating . As for the whimper of the end : it  s not . As it tedious and redundant , but it is resolution and it is the full circle coming out of the character . Fanning is at her best here . She human emotion and reality . There is a lot of because it  s a mystery movie , but most of all be prepared to be out ; and that is why you  want the movie to be over .",1
"War of the is a semi - intelligent , new take on an old genre . Whereas in the past tend to focus on heroic bloodshed or the right people in the right place saving the day , here we have a far more intimate and realistic perspective : the involved don  t head off to discover their amazing flying over the course of two , they run away in terror , each man , woman and child constantly with his or her inner demon  s , weakness and fear , something which is probably best represent by Cruise  s son suggesting that the Smiler himself is merely looking for his ex - wife to pawn his off on her . Whether this is true or not is an avenue left unexplored and this from the film a great deal . War of the World  s emotional heart , like many , is either on its sleeve or invisible . include Park where the only was to express were child like enthusiasm , child like fear , child like anguish and child like cynicism when it is that he might have made a teensy mistake in an island full of giant . However , unlike Park , War of the to screw the tension into the unbearable of previous . When , for example ,  s grand ( or is he their granduncle ?) are being by through the in Park it is as tense a moment as can be , expertly drawn out with many false and dramatic . The consummate skill shown in making that and other made Park one of the and most successful ever ( the prefix   is purely in a popcorn , summer blockbuster sense ). On the other hand ... when a giant , snake like head goes poking around in War of the , in a scene that remarkably on at the last minute , the tension is more  Why are they doing that ? than  Please don  t die ! Oh God , I can  t look ...! Robbin  s character like little more than an excuse to present the side of human . Instead of Cruise  s rushing around to return his to their mother we have a long , drawn out scene which little sense ( style incompetent , unobservant , they - can - cross - the - void - of - space - but - they - can  t - find - three - people ) and with different , notably a black soldier , being all heroic and saving our Lord . This into another , niggly point : continuity . As already been pointed out on this , somehow to remember that his electrical storm ought to destroy various electrical equipment such as digital ( most importantly with the journalist who Cruise one of the landing in his / her / its giant tripod ). Similarly : when Cruise  s prison is by the tripod he with no human inside is even remotely hurt , despite the fact that the impact the metal shell enough to crack it open . Most annoyingly : a person , who was a very annoying character much deserving of death in my opinion , headlong into a suicidal battle only to turn up safe and sound later on . On top of all this , Boston is apparently too irrelevant a metropolis to warrant destruction by alien . Finally the last awkward detail : why would capable of burying vast , mechanical many ago deep in the ground of our fair planet so that they can take over many later ( a time line the narrator us ) bother going to all that trouble when they could  just got set up when they came to put said down in the first place !?! And why  t they by the same bacteria that did for them when they returned ? Oh and bacteria  t the on the planet . This been a long tirade of negativity but War of the is still , despite my rating , worth a look . It  s long , poorly thought out and recklessly indulgent of its director  s desire to be different . On the other hand it is a film and does have many of his high quality : film making flare , visual understanding , extreme tension building , a score , an actor being an unexpectedly human hero and other such . However , by comparison to much of his other work , it way short . A lot was made in the - release about how quickly this film was made , some ( himself ) suggesting that the whole thing was a crazy proposition . It to me that he was a lot closer to that mark than intended and the film sorely some re - and re - to cover up some disappointing continuity and . Still , to Star episode three , not to mention the not - so - Fantastic Four , it as one of the better this summer . Unfortunately , it that the best come up with recently way short of what went before . Over the next few we may well see the Summer Blockbuster becoming the Art - house Classic as the balance of power to a younger breed of talented ... all I can say is roll up King !",1
"I  m your average guy , I don  t read comic , and I usually don  t comment about . Here is some thing a lot of people who gave this movie a bad review might not understand . The Fantastic 4 is a great movie !!! Especially for people who are too young to remember the comic or the show !!! I remember when I was 9 old , The Fantastic 4 used to be on late night on Cartoon Network . That was the only time I remember hearing about them or seeing them on a main stage . Ten later , a smile comes to my face when I hear about a movie being made about the I vaguely remember loving as a child . I don  t read comic . I could care less about the comic book accuracy . I just see some guy burst into , fly , and say smart ** .  t do it for me , X - Men  t , the only Batman movie I truly was Batman Forever ( Robin was cool , and Bale  t even act in Batman .) I  never a superhero movie more than the Fantastic 4 . It  s got such a simple formula : What would you do if you woke up one morning with ? Each character was real . was an adventurous guy before the accident , of course he  s not going to stay up in lab all day . Reed was a geek , he stayed a geek the whole movie . Sue was like ... the  dude , I totally do your  type . She was responsible and everything ... and she so hot in that cat suit . Ben was great as the family man who goes through the trauma of losing his wife and being out - . I the Fantastic 4 because each character goes through their own , but the dramatic bull ****  t eclipse all the awesome action . I because Peter still like a dopey , love sick , puppy even when he was kicking some bad guy . This movie had the right balance of emotion and butt - kicking . The had such great chemistry ! The scene after goes to the contest was priceless . It was basically : This is how you bicker with . The with the Thing to life with big was great . You can  t just wake up one morning bigger than life and expect to be able to do everything normal . The with Sue stripping down in the middle of the street were so true . Is there a better way to get away from a crowd than turning invisible and stripping off all your clothes ? The little like all of  s clothes burning , the , the action , the way the Thing a huge bundle of for his juice in the morning , all those make this movie great . When you see the Fantastic 4 , it  s like you  re watching 4 people  s change through a hidden camera . They  re doing their normal , everyday stuff ... except with wicked cool .",1
"I it ! There  s no comparison between the first and this one . Highly . is superb as Willy . He a unique , funny , and likable side to the character . There is more insight on Willy and his past in this version . It that you are left wondering from the original . It is to present day as well . The is very unique as well .

"I  seen Phantom Several Times on Stage , and this movie  t even come close to the stage production at ALL . I was really with the Movie not what I from at all , not that all of his are bad , I actually enjoy quite a few of his , but in this one The Phantom was poorly , was well , plot was nothing like the stage production , some of the musical were rushed I think the thing I Most about the Movie was the Music , but that  s because I enjoy singing along . More then Likely I won  t be the to My collection , thought I will be the . I still think the best Phantom , and the best I  ever seen . I was to see Minnie Driver in this Movie ,  t think she go for a role like that .",0
"Dark Water is the story of a woman and her daughter moving into a new apartment . The apartment just might be or the eerie could be the result of the mother  s sanity . What really me is that people keep saying : It  s just like  The Ring . Please realize , just like the say : They were written by the SAME guy !!!!!!!!!! Dark Water , however , is more drama than mystery and the only thing they have in common is the dead girl living in the water tower . She does NOT crawl out of anything and she normal . The cinematography was great . It was a beautiful movie . The acting was great . I won  t be if this movie an nomination . I hope it does . Don  t go in anything scary . Expect a sad , drama about a mother struggling to keep her daughter .",1
"This movie was predictable , and disappointing if you look at the acting and extremely GENERIC plot . It had it  s funny but mostly the sex alive in this society today . You have two  strong men  who want to sleep with all of the  gullible  and  EASY  they can . Every stereotype ever about men and are displayed here and frankly I found this film to be disgusting and insulting . It is definitely a  GUY FILM  in fact I think I  seen enough in this film to last me for a long time . I recommend paying for it , just remember that this movie IS funny , because it fun at our societal and .. it  s about all of us - remember that when you  re laughing it up , I did .",1

"The  Bad News  remake its purpose but don  t think that it  s any improvement over the original . is excellent and some of the new ( such as the Hooper ) add some new to the movie . However , some of the best of the original are either toned down or left out , the classic  Kelly Leak  s one bad mother  scene ( which is one area where the original script should have been 100 %). The worst part of the movie in comparison with the 1976 version are the of and Kelly Leak . These two are not nearly as well as in the original , especially the pivotal role of . However , the movie is still very enjoyable and worth seeing if you  re a fan of the 1976 film .",1
"Whatever you think of Batman , you kind of have to give more credit to X - Men and for getting it right the first time . The at Warner have their over what they want to do with this superhero franchise of theirs that they go and retool it every two . So it  s kind of watching this one , in ways good and bad . For one , I feel a little disappointed in the : it  s more like a bat tank . Mainly , though , the story  s a lot more complicated with its cast of . If I  t know any better , I  d guess there  s a rule that anyone who  s ever been nominated for an a coupon for a free role in a Batman movie that everyone  s in on ( if you want to know the exact , which I hope you do because I spent 10 this , 5 in this movie have 12 between them ), and they had to try extra hard to find for everyone ., which led to some who just  t need to be there . Like Morgan Freeman , for example , is a scientist who Batman  s . I love Morgan Freeman but what exactly is he doing there ?  t Q belong with Bond ? Also , who  s the real villain ? Aside from making the story , I think part of the fun of Batman is that you have this hero dressed up as a bat and then you have even with of their own , like a guy who like a Penguin or the Riddler . With the exception of the Scarecrow , this movie  t really have that here . Unfortunately , I  t really see the scarecrow that much , anyway . I think the reason for someone like crime boss was to show us how bad of a place is . Now Burton  t ever need to resort to that . He such a dark tone that he could show us what was just by showing us a frame of it . I will add , though , that most people who see this movie will probably agree that Commissioner and are both two really strong in this movie and they add a lot , unlike the other where they kind of stand around and look like next to Batman . So , as I say , the story  s different but as it on its own , it really works well . It had the same piecing - together - of - the - puzzle element that the Star had , which is real cool . If you  watched any Batman episode or watched any Batman movie , then you can  t help but be by a movie that the , where did Batman get the idea for Batman , how did he get the or the , where did he learn to fight ?, .",1
"I have to say , I usually don  t read Lee . Nothing against them , just never got into them . So , for me , this movie going experience was my first trip into the world of the Fantastic Four , and it was a good time . , Storm , is superb as the cocky and to steal just about every scene with his over - the - top flamboyance . and Alba display good tension and chemistry from the moment they share a scene . No need to delve too much into the drama of their relationship , you see the way the two look at each other and you know there  s a past .  s performance is convincing ( though it  s obvious this guy is , trying to use an accent ) and Alba , wow , what a sweet presence she to the screen . Obviously , she  t hard on the , but she herself in such a sensual way that you can  t help but fall in love with her . I must say , the biggest disappointment I had was with as Victor Doom . He his part well , but like the in Daredevil , he  t shown enough . He does play a great bad guy ( of course , he is an evil businessman ) but I  t think they had enough tension build up between him and the . You knew he was be po  about his business going under , so there was no chance for hostility to build , it was pretty much there once the experiment took place . And for a bad guy , he  t have much of an agenda . He basically was trying to get back at the Fantastic Four , turn them against each other , but no bold for , holding the world hostage , nothing . For an evil guy , he certainly  t have many evil , which I find , since he had been an adventurous entrepreneur . you wonder . does a good job of a tormented thug . Man , if I had strength like that , I  t be , I  d be out there kicking the out of people , just for the fun of it . was perfectly cast as The Thing , though I found it rather crass that his wife left him because he was deformed . I guess love  t last forever if your spouse becomes a mutant . As a whole , I pretty much got what I from this movie . Great special effects , good action ( though not enough of it ), believable interaction between the , I give this one high . Not a bad movie to show to either ( though it does show Alba briefly in her , oh ya ). Just do yourself a favor : when you  re watching it , suspend your disbelief , just for a short time . Let the special effects and the fun carry the way and don  t over analyze too much . No , seriously , don  t do it .",0
"Absolutely . Try not to find anything out about the plot it  ruin it for you , just go and see it . Don  t it , it  be not be half as good on a small screen , get yourself to the cinema and prepare for a two hour roller coaster ride . This film is a in horror , within the first ten you  have for breath and out of your skin . Then following this for the next hour or so the director a feeling of claustrophobia and an overwhelming sense of foreboding , priming your body , you just on edge enough to react with terror when the action . And happen it does , your to fright after fright , thick and fast until the ending ( which is actually good ). Once the roll you won  t want to move , just sit for a while getting your breath back . And then go watch it again .",1
"it  s a movie worth watching i am a big fan of marvel and especially of the fantastic four i  been reading the since my childhood i was very disappointed that like daredevil flunk because it  t fell real this movie felt real even when it  s totally not possible splendid action e real action story i hope they make a sequel th thing was cool but i hope they let it evolve more like in the . more   would be nice . X - men and x2 where great but i hope they can make an even better fantastic four next time . but as a film fan , this movie some but that  t mean this movie  t good . it  s everything i and more . for every out there watch this movie .",1
"Lots of fuss on this board about the movie , but in my opinion , good enough to plunk down 4 and rent it for a night . Th highlight of the movie are the special effects , closely by the performance of one . A truly captivating performance that had me . I can only imagine what it  s like to lose a twin sister , but from my personal , I can say that most of the twin talk in the movie is dead on . It that I have a couple who have either a spouse or who are , but what do I know . Anyway the point is it off effortlessly and should be considered one of the best of the year . Not much to say about the special effects except that they are first rate . With so much being done on a computer these days , it  s not hard to tell the difference between whats real and a video game . ( of  comes to mind when I think of overdone computer - special effects .) So in a nutshell , the movie does not suck , is not great , and is somewhere in between . And yes , is not a great actor , not even a good actor , but I will still take time to check out his . Check out  Something  s Give -- a much better movie -- if you want a good , clean , performance . As he was good , in a dirty , life - kind of way . Lower your a bit and you may enjoy this little nugget of a movie .",0
"As a member of the community , I was blown away by this film ... By the tight screenplay , the professional direction , and the phenomenal acting . In my opinion , I think this is one of the best of the year so far . With that said , it is not a film for . It is not a film meant to portray ideal role for . It IS a film meant to realistically depict the of people who live at the very bottom of  s socioeconomic ladder . If you find yourself unable to reserve judgment against people born into a life so vastly different than your own , you will probably not like this film . In order to appreciate it , you have to be able to see past the moral and ethical of these . So if anyone unsure whether they can handle the ugliness of this type of world , but still curious enough to see it , take a cue from the ... When a culture vastly different than your own , make sure to leave the and of your society at home . Because once you impose the moral judgment and ethical of your world upon another  s , you  your objectivity . And by doing so , miss the very point of empathy .",1
"when I saw the for this film my were along the of  , stop with the horror . As someone who watched ring before any of this up whereby now creepy white are a staple part of any horror film I am sick to the teeth of them . Prior to seeing this I had just seen the descent , a superb horror film , and somewhat had my faith in the genre . The really clincher was the fact that Waler directed this and I really the motorcycle . I believe that you can see his touch throughout the film and are probably more likely to enjoy this if you  seen his previous work because you know what your getting . This is a classy drama film with of horror laden through it . Every time into the mirror ( and believe me she does it a lot ) your waiting for the creature to appear behind her . You are constantly waiting for that jump . The air of tension is well and I the ghost itself is of a relationship between a mother and a daughter and that is essentially what this film is about . I was disappointed to see so many negative about this film because I actually believe its the fault of the marketing campaign that people will be let down . As a 20 something male I know nothing about the relationship between mother and daughter yet I really felt for the ( the cast give beautiful a beauty mirrored in its direction ) and it was handled delicately and thoughtfully . Not only this but it never gave in to the audience expectation of seeing that ghostly little or at least not in the way you expect it . A beautiful drama about motherhood , if thats what you want to see , see this .",1
"Of course i was ready to be disappointed after reading every in US harshly this movie and all of the people involved in it - and of course i really should thank these so - since i was pleasantly with the result . F4 is , better than just ; it  s enjoyable - it the simple clear fun comic book feeling of their Lee and Jack back in the 60  s . and for me it was almost more than i hoped for in the first place . F4 is one of the best comic book adaptation so far . Only X MEN 2 and BATMAN are superior , far superior ; F4 is as good as X MEN and 2 and away above and BATMAN . And please don  t bother compare with DAREDEVIL , HULK or worse again , , THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY , SUPERMAN ( yes , not all of the from the 70  s were ), SPAWN or THE PUNISHER as there are some of the worst ever made in any genre . I can understand that both and were dubious when about the chosen director of this project . Story is no Singer , Burton , or even ( sic !); he was in fact the director of 2 terrible idiotic . and Alba is no or Berry , Mac is no Mac , is no , is no Alan ... i could go on and on with the different attached to the project . But finally everyone involved did their job and they did a good job . The director is not as talented as Singer ( he did such a wonderful job on x men 2 !) that  s for sure but he did a decent job though ; the were pretty close to their character and and were particularly good . Even Alba did good . That  s true she is way too young to play Sue but if you want to blame someone , blame our youth male society ; not the actress . The screenplay was fairly true to the essence of Lee and Jack  comic . anyway , off to everyone involved here and hopefully F4 will be as enjoyable as part one .",0
"Well exactly as my summary , this is a very well made straight - out unpretentious movie about a fading wildlife - film director  s attempt to re - create his past success that made him some sort of cult phenomenon . Reading a few of the other , I think this is evidently a  hate it or love it  film , however a lot of people seem to have the point - I don  t think this film was really intended as a , to me it was more just about the and between the various and maybe even an exploration of the human spirit . The motivation for this project is revenge on the  leopard shark  that his best friend / long - standing partner and there is a lot of emotion on the way , an inspiring relationship between him and his long lost son , whom he never met but was a huge fan of his as a boy , and the constant drama between him and his wife , who  s father  s money payed for his entire career . excellent cinematography , with some great , marine life in a very fashion , and beautiful , as well as a very well put - together , The and era Bowie in with a classical guitar accompaniment . We also see Bill at his best as well as a heart - warming performance by , who I am not normally a fan of . The script is also very well written and the story is so well put - together that even an attack by or a large scientific institution seem plausible in a serious movie about an oceanographer ! Overall , this is a brilliant film and there  t a lot more I can say .",1

"Sadly I think I was built up to think this was going to be a good , scary , creepy film . Unfortunately it was none of the above . Whilst I  t go so far as to call it a bad film I can  t bring myself to say it was good either . It certainly some good , but sadly it a lot of dull as well , some people will prefer the pace of the first half of the movie , like me will prefer it when it up a bit in the second half . I think one problem was too many , none of which we really get to know and therefore care about , I found it hard to care about the fate of these complete . This is particularly odd as , like I mention above , the first half of the movie is very slow moving and should have been used as a chance to really get to know the . But to be honest I  t tell one character from another throughout the movie . I would have the movie better maybe if they had given us 3 or 4 and built them up with individual , it to be like they were only 2 different out of all the . The second problem is , well quite frankly it  s not scary , not necessarily a major problem for some but for a movie that had a small budget , not exactly great acting and a one sentence plot outline , it was obviously on being scary to get by . And thats where it down , yes there are a few scattered jump , but most of them are fake if you like . ( sort of like the old classic , hear a noise then a cat out type ) When it actually came to the crunch the that should have been scary simply  t . Rent this when it comes out if you like , or are looking for a non - scary thriller , but if you are looking for a decent thriller or horror I  t bother .",1
"This movie is very good looking . The   are extremely creepy looking and the sound effects are . Everything a good horror movie needs you might say . Well , not exactly , unfortunately the movie also from some bad storytelling and a  scare  overdose that take away a lot of the movie its tension and scary . It  The Grudge  a good looking but horror movie , that perhaps still more goods as but still remains a bit of a disappointing movie with lots of . Problem is that they basically tried to put a scary moment in literally almost every scene . I don  t know why but after a while some of the scene  s loose their power to scare you . Maybe its because you get used to the atmosphere and the scare of the movie , or something like that . Instead of making the movie scary it made the movie predictable and too much of the same the whole time . The movie its story is told in a completely illogically way . the time - line is very messy , it from the present to what a few or days or before to some totally different . It  s not that it becomes difficult to follow but it  s just that it pointless and unneeded that the story is told in that particular way . It also from the main story line and the main character by the boring and untalented acting . As a matter of fact , the story is told in such a way that the main character is perhaps only on screen for 50 % of its running time , at the most . Big plus of me was Ted in a typical Ted role . His more famous brother Sam was one of the of the movie . Too bad Sam  t directed this , I  m sure he would had made something more of this movie . It  s all too bad , cause  The Grudge  is a well made movie that had lots of potential to become just as good as the other horror movie remake  The Ring . The movie however heavily from the ambition to make this the ultimate scary movie . You might say that this movie of a scare overdose . Still of course the movie still remain perfectly watchable thanks to the visual look of it and some nice . 6 / 10http :// bobafett1138 . . /",1

"The trend of Marvel being transferred from the comic to the big screen with Story  s adaptation of the  Fantastic Four . By an ensemble of popular rather then any big , Story the audience to concentrate on the movie and the incredible special effects . The sexy Alba from Dark Angel and Sin City fame on the role of the Invisible girl and although the male audience will be disappointed to learn they  hardly see . Alba , rest assured when you do see her , the wait is worth it . To see from  The Shield  as straight up  good guy  is both strange and refreshing . Casting as the  The Thing  could have been considered as a risk but both the and must be smiling to learn their gamble off and then some . who the slick . Troy in Nip / Tuck as the villainous electric Doom while on the other side of the intensity spectrum , the  flame  of  The Torch  and the audience chucking with his witty , - esquire performance . The enjoyable and atypical plot the audience to gradually learn about the , their and the they endure as they come to with their fate .

"House of Wax  ( 2005 ) . Collet - Serra It  s become something of a with film or movie to begin their of  House of Wax  by confirming whether or not can act . Obviously most of the will have extremely negative about  s performance , but I really don  t think she was as dreadful as you might expect . Perhaps might not have really to be an actress by ambition or her part in this movie through hard audition and practice , the way she is she probably woke up one morning with a and decided she might go out and begin acting today . However , her performance really  t that bad . Maybe this is just me being since I do enjoy  The Simple Life , I find extremely attractive , and enjoy seeing what she  s up to in every other magazine , but I do also think she does reasonably well with a small part . Her chase scene and showdown with the killer particularly is one of the film  s best , and since  t really have that much to do in the movie ( and what she does have to do she does adequately , sometimes even charmingly - I the  yes , let  s follow the smell ... why ? scene with ), who rant that she the year  s worst female performance are completely unfair , they are most probably simply in the movie because she  s . Now that we  that fiasco , the film overall was an enjoyable night out - it had everything you look for in this genre and left me feeling satisfied and throughout . Personally I  t find the movie very scary , but it did have some very good boo ( the mirror one especially ), and the wax people were genuinely creepy . The film to maintain a great atmosphere , there  s a constant chill in the wind in this deserted and town , you can tell something  s wrong the moment they set foot in the town ( if it  s not already obvious from or reading what the film  s about ). I to my great surprise that the to develop these , which to it being dragged out a little too long . While I did respect this decision to try and add some meat to the of the six , it never really works as naturally as it did in 2003  s  The Massacre , such a brilliant success that year that it now like the slasher movie to beat . Most of the character / non - waxy material in  Wax  just unnecessary in the long run , the only character who from this period of  development  is Chad , awkwardly unlikeable and harsh at the start , he becomes more sympathetic and likable after we hear a little about his life and begin to come to with why this guy is the way he is . I was to hate the in this film but he ended up being one of my in the movie . Wax  s and may not come as fast as you may expect , but they are definitely worth waiting around for . This film , unlike so many of the being lately ,  t hold back on the gore and  t let the gorgeous ( even those who survive ) to go out gracefully . I have another complaint that I see other and movie have had with this most - enjoyable film : , nor any of the other in the film , never touch wax and say  that  s hot . A pet peeve , but it  s something I was looking for . Never mind though -  House of Wax  is a lot of fun and will immediately fall into the good of horror . Enjoy ! 7 / 10",1
"Sin city is gritty , dark and well dark . You have to be a certain type of person to like this ( the term literally ) of a film . It a huge amount of film but it off very well . Don  t be by the black and white as you will not even notice it after a while plus it to the flavour of the film . this movie is an incredibly violent but very cool comic strip . The three plot had good story and and at a break neck speed that my attention with ease . Good acting from all the cast with a host of well known and very suitable for the main .

For a people who enjoy animated as much as me , you  realize that a lot of the movie was  copied  or should I say  have  from other . This movie is worth praising because of many .

Although it also them tremendous trouble at times , it the teamwork , honestly , loyalty , friendship an above it all ,- trust .

"I must admit to not being a fan of the . They don  t look particularly inventive , the voice talent is often at best , or at worst , poor , and the are very sparse . really is no exception to the rule . We first meet the of the film - the - at the New York Zoo . ( voiced by Rock ) is a zebra with captivity and longing for the freedom of the wild . ( voiced by Ben Stiller ) is a vain yet cowardly lion , happy to pose for the public in his cage , and so full of himself that he little of himself as birthday . ( voiced by ) is a hypochondriac giraffe , while the hippo ( voiced by Smith ) is an earth , keeping her in check . There is a also a small of in the zoo who want to go to Antarctica . These are funny and inventive , but a little at odds with the rest of the film . This film its - the going on the subway to Grand Central Station ; the and who rule the island of ( the wild is so keen on ); and the film and - Five O , Born Free , of Fire , Beauty , and more . But the are two - dimensional , the script is needlessly childish ( yes , I know it is for , but give them some credit for brains ), and the film is pretty pointless , other than the same old  you  got a friend  theme that almost every film from the studio .

"I agree with what so many have said about the shallow and offensive nature of this film  s examination of racism . It is baffling to me that so many people seem to have been by its pretentiousness . I want to comment on the character as an example of what  s most about this movie . Here we have a man who -- with the film  s underlying message that  we  re all a LITTLE racist  -- effectively a woman in public , cruelly humiliating her husband and deliberately him to make a move that , as he well , will lead to his arrest or even death . He does all this after the couple over without any legal cause but because , as we come to understand , they are black and wealthy and he is a hurt little boy who is now the police and can therefore do as he . This behavior is not a LITTLE racist . This behavior is evil . It is disturbing to me that this extreme of racism is up next to another character  s behavior -- spouting her paranoid about gang violence -- to illustrate that everybody  s a LITTLE racist . Later , we  re spoon - fed some tripe about  s poor old dad and how black drove him into the poor house . Is this supposed to explain , or worse , excuse this behavior ? And is  s character meant to redeem himself by the utterly unmotivated and unbelievable , laughably coincidental act of saving the woman he sexually the very night before ? Please . The fact that so many people seem to feel some kind of self - congratulatory admiration for this film me feel sad about the shallowness of our understanding of racism , and our apparent lack of commitment to condemning and ending it .",1
"I never read any Fantastic Four , so I cannot tell if the director with the or not , but all I can tell after watching the movie is that it  s better than any MARVEL inspired movie that I  d seen ( that ). The story been intricately plot , and the certainly much better than the cartoon series , if not the ( which I don  t know about ). The four plus Van Doom , their sponsor , go on a space mission to study human better , but that mission goes haywire , as all of them get exposed to heavy radiation of an unknown kind . Next the story , how each of the five come to realize their own . Something which us more insight on the . Special focus is given on  The Thing  as because of his hideous .

"Following the recent wave of comic book that with 1978  s Superman , Fantastic Four is another product of this fad .

"I went to see this movie about a week ago in the theater and am going again today to see it . is so funny in this movie i was cracking up from beginning to end . I it . The movie had a wonderful story line and a lot of action to . The other thing i about it was that it  t have hardly any bad language in it at all . So all in all it was a really clean , funny , and action film that was wonderful to watch . I would say it was as about as good as national treasure ... which also was a fabulous movie as well . They both had good action and comedy in them . So for a movie that will give you of and good acting , go see  .",1

"Where is City ? I only ask because this movie you feel as if you could actually go there , as if it actually somewhere . I Burton  s Batman , but  s vision is so well paced and so real , that it is , in my humble opinion , the first REAL Batman movie . Bale Batman to life with all of the emotion of a real person , I guess it a real actor to do so . The supporting cast is a group of with so much character that they could have had there own . is awesome . So many great stumble some during their running time , but this one did not miss a step . 10 out of 10 . I wonder if would give me a loan ?",1
"It  s a long way from to San in a - 4 . Will a plane with a cabin filled with people make it ? Like the actual flight , this movie is VERY long and mostly VERY boring . I recommend paying attention to the boarding (  t a state when this movie was made , and this is way , way before 9 / 11 ), and then , once aboard , take a nap or try a little remote control time travel to get to the  oh my God , are they going to make it or not  ending . I  m an aviation nut . The airplane , airport , control tower and center are now vintage stuff . The of Center  t show a single radar scope -- which sense for the time . The of early 1950  s navigation are also great from an aviation history point of view . K . , the author of the book on which the movie is based , also wrote the screenplay for the movie . He was an pilot during the golden age of Air Transport , so you  d expect a realistic story ; but , other than the last 15 or so of the movie , there is very little action . I remember thinking during the early part of the movie that there sure were a lot of petty little people with a bunch of petty little . ( I later checked the book out from my local library and , much to my horror , discovered that the book too a bunch of petty little people with a bunch of petty little . I never made it through the book .) but the movie , well , the last fifteen of the movie just about make up for everything else . The last fifteen tell you everything you need to know . . . that - pilot had some  bad luck  in South , but that when the going tough , ( what a surprise ) is the man you want in the cockpit . Of course , the going DOES get tough , and to slap pilot Stack into shape , just like Stack sort of to slap into shape ( over the Radio ) in  Airplane . ( In fact , the slapping scene that place in the passenger cabin of the 707 in  Airplane  is a perfect parody of slapping Stack in the cockpit of their - 4 . Also ,  Airplane  s  flight attendant blowing air into an inflatable auto pilot is a great parody of  Miss Spalding  her mouth to gently inflate a  Mae West  on a young passenger in  The High and the Mighty .)  Airplane  is a great movie , but if you haven  t seen  The High and the Mighty , you might not realize that  Airplane  is just one continuous spoof of the that afflicted the people and that wrote about .  The High and the Mighty ,  The Crowded Skies , and  Fate is the  were all / that  Airplane  poked fun at . I usually imagine riding off into the sunset at the end of a movie , but at the end of  The High and the Mighty  he into the fog , whistling a tune that will stay with you for the rest of your life .

"This movie was very interesting I thought . The plot is very but if you pay very close attention then you can understand it . Basically what this movie is about is Heaven and Hell . had of as a child and soon tried to commit suicide , which is considered a mortal sin . However after the attempt him . He was dead for 2 and he spent those two in Hell , and basically after seeing how horrible Hell was he never to go back . So in a desperate attempt to buy his way into Heaven , he off the that are trying to cross over into the real world . The story us that there is a demon in every bad man and an angel in every good one . So when the attempt to come through , them off . But this still  t good enough to get into Heaven . In the beginning an angel that he can  t buy his way into Heaven . what he can do and said self sacrifice . And then she him he  s f ***** which I found funny because she  s an angel . But anyway ... In the end just before the spawn of Satan is release , the devil . ( Quick reminder that Hell him ) The girl he  s been with , , a sister who did the same thing that did , suicide because of the she had . said that as long as she can go to Heaven instead of Hell , he  go to Hell with him . However that is considered a self sacrifice and before the Devil can take him , He and goes to Heaven ... briefly . Satan him , say that he  s going to keep on the earth until he that he in Hell . , No ? well I this movie . There could have been more action but it actually was much more a suspenseful movie than it was action or horror . However if that is what Hell is really like I  m afraid to go there too . No this is no  Little Nicky  Hell . This is a terrifying portrait of Hell . It me out at least . CAST : The acting is . , although I honestly think he could use some acting , is the perfect person to play the part of . He  s not tormented by the he , he almost them as . Just more fun . And he does portray that well . 8 / 10 : does an job in this movie . To be honest I her role in the mummy more than in . In the end she just had no effect on me . I  t have care if she . But she did an job in showing how much she for her sister , and how much she really wished she could have her . 5 / 10 : is going to be a big star when he older . He becomes a bigger part of this movie towards the end and he  t really have much to portray , but he his part perfectly . An eager wanting to be like .  If you  re sitting on the bench you be ready to play , right ? - Best quote in the movie . I was like  YES !  s play a bigger part . 9 / 10 So all in all , good movie that could have used development around the plot . 7 . 5 / 10",0
"In the tradition of comic book - to - film ,   ( no , not THAT ) very little in the way of plot and just squarely on special effects and such . Also in line with such tradition , it all but completely the source material , which in this case are the / Vertigo   . Though I  m not big on the   series , which have seen their most popular through comic book artist Garth , I do realize that much is different from the source material , the fact that morose hard - a ** anti - hero is and most of the action of the place in , . But I  m not here to make ; I  m here to judge a movie . The best thing to be said about   is that it you watching , not just for the effects and strong visual delight but because it  s fantasy - interesting fantasy . In  , we learn that ( the effectively wooden ), is dying of cancer , forbidden from entering Heaven as a result of an suicide ( he was clinically dead for two ), a bad attitude , and can see yet no one else can . To think that a normal person could see you  d have no choice but to declare that person insane , right ? and , we learn , cannot enter into the human plane of existence but strange in force to search for after he  s in public view by a demon . The plot to   more than a passing resemblance to a past vehicle ( The Matrix , anyone ?), in that as human , we are completely oblivious to the truth about our reality . As the film , two in discover the Spear of Destiny , the weapon to have been used to kill during the Crucifixion . One of them high - it to where the main plot of the film is revealed . , the twin sister of ( ), suicide . , the dogged detective she is , the official story because she her sister was a devout Catholic and would never commit suicide , as such an act would require eternal damnation in Hell . The special effects are nonstop , and there is one effective and horrific sequence where to Hell , which is in all , a vision of except it  s a place where and the damned roam . With the help of his legion of otherworldly allies , who include normal human ( ), a half - breed ( ), appropriately Father ( ) and the angel ( ), and race against time to stop a nefarious plot waged by the of Hell that could bring about the apocalypse . The plot , if you want to call it that , is pretty non - existent and is pretty wooden as usual but let  s face it , nobody in this cast is going to get come next spring . The film for about the first 20 or so but becomes more engaging as it goes through its . Director ( of music video infamy , which for the camera - work ) does his best , but somehow or another the film can  t really seem to get it together when it comes to certain of the script . For example , it  s not really sure what it to be : a horror movie , fantasy , thriller , what ? It  s not really sure and I  m not really sure of what it to do . Such  t plague the viewer but it does , to me , play out a lot like a - mash of all three . As the anti - hero chain smoker ,  wooden acting is effective ( is there any other way to play such a character ?) and as the film you can tell he  s really suffering inside , as he sicker and sicker from cancer . And we also believe his desperation as he to send half - to Hell in order to get back on God  s good side so he can enter Heaven when he . In his character , we also get our fair share of and demonic and chanting and such . The opening sequence alone back uncomfortable of  The Exorcist  ( 1973 ).  may win over die - of the   and people may or may not get a kick out of Peter as an - wearing Satan . Like Neo ,  Whoa . 6 / 10",0
"The original is much better ! The were better , the were better , Walter is a much better Buttermaker ... Billy Bob just made the role sleazy and unsympathetic . It was much more shocking back in the 70  s also ... now the humor just crass and sleazy . All the magic from the first one was absent in this one . It like they were trying way too hard to copy the original and somehow got lost , ending up with a dud of a movie . Why mess with a good movie anyway ? It  s like trying to remake Grease ... you just can  t do it . Just an overall BAD remake . 1 / 10 . Skip this one ; see the original instead .",0
"Sin City is one of the best I have seen until now to transfer to the big screen a comic book . It totally the comic artist  s ( Frank Miller that is ) perspective and a decent ( and in a great part very successful ) effort to transfer it to screen . A great deal of this achievement should be ( in my opinion ) to Frank Miller himself , since not only he - directed the film with , but also in the first place his Sin City graphic are in such a way as to oftentimes give the impression that you have in front of you a for a film . He a very cinematographic way of sketching . The aesthetics of the movie is fascinating and the way shot it ( the play most of the times in front of blue and then drawing the background scenery ) in order to give it a more comic - like look off and dearly to the accurate transfer to the screen the biggest part of the comic  s dark , and at times atmosphere . I believe that , with Sin City , set a new standard for the that are comic book ( as was his intention in the first place ). A special credit should be given to  s acting which is excellent . completely and inspiringly to life one of the most touching of Sin City ( ) exactly as in the comic . One of his best of late . The movie  s violence may disturb some , but nobody said that Sin City is a movie for . A rather hilarious remark about the film I was while waiting in the line outside the cinema when I went to see it . It came from a middle - aged woman , coming out of the cinema some before the end ( god I hate those people ) and  warning  us :  Go grab a straw while you are at it , to suck all the blood . It is true that the movie is not kind with its audience , but that is the least to be when and Miller - direct and special - guest - . In the bottom line I thoroughly Sin City . Not so much as reading the graphic though , but I believe that many will find it even more exciting .  s and Miller  s inspired direction a compelling , dark atmosphere . The great cast very good ( with best of all in my opinion  s ) and on top of it all is the scenario with as original as any , in our times , can be . A flick definitely worth seeing at least once .",1

"I am so sad that and agreed to be part of such a terrible movie . This movie is racist , and violent . Rape is never funny ! is not funny ! Family ( or all of society for that case ) should not allow people to be on for being different . The only who are not  white  are as being either ridiculously simple minded or household help ( not of   society ). There were a few that I thought were funny . However , I was offended for more of the movie than I was . I considered leaving about half way through this movie , but I decided that I should give it a chance to redeem itself before I left in anger . It  t redeem itself . If you choose to see this movie I won  t judge . But , if you find this funny , I hope that you will examine the racist , , and violent of what you call comedy !",0
"As a fan of the Hitchhiker Guide book series , I was very excited that they were finally making a big - budget treatment of the original classic . After seeing it on opening day , I thought the movie was well - cast , well - and well - produced . The visual effects were great ( and I even like how they  s two - headed aspect minimal , yet non - cheesy looking effects ). And is hot . But as the movie came to a close , it achingly clear that there is no possible way a normal two - hour movie could really do the book justice , despite all the great about it . Even though it been since I last read the book , I as I was watching this movie that so many that made the book great were out of the movie . This movie was hacked to ! If everything had been included in this movie , it would have doubled or the run - time , which would just not have been commercial and therefore would have made this movie  s release inconceivable . I left the theater wishing that I had recently re - read the book to fill in the many I felt from watching this movie . So when it becomes available on , I  re - read the book immediately before it for one final . And hopefully the will fill in a few more . If you  re reading this and haven  t yet read the book , my suggestion is to read the book in conjunction with watching the movie , just to see how other have of the book . I am sad to report that this movie simply  t ( and can  t ) stand on it  s own . 42",1

"I simply fail to understand how this film is so popular ... it  s quite simply beyond me . The only way I can explain it is that all the of King  s short story found it very true to the spirit of the book , and 10 for that . I really could not find anything worth my time in this film , and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end , one or two good of and the acting , there  s really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for . It  s about hope ... and the director won  t let us forget it , so it  s repeated until the audience it in our sleep . It  s like this short , one - note story was written , and the author just  t want to end it ... so he kept writing ... and writing ... until someone had the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yelling  for the love of all that is holy , stop writing ! And I thank that faceless man for doing that , because it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was 142 long , and not 284 , or , dare I say it , 568 . The film simply on and on , scene after scene , nothing remotely interesting ( but with excellent acting , mind you ). There  s nothing good about this film except for the acting . Just about all of it is great . I can  t really think of anything else to say ... I guess my dislike for the film from my hatred of King  s writing . I suppose it is possible for someone who is neutral on his works to enjoy this film . I recommend this to of King , the and possibly Frank . If you  re not a fan of any of these people , I doubt you  d find this enjoyable . 5 / 10",0
"This Batman a strong script and is very well directed while still dark it is also not as dark as the original by Burton don  t get me wrong Burton good even the new Willy is good but personally I like  s version much more . While the Bale and were one - sided even was not as good as usual but the - Cane and Morgan Freeman were very good . But when Bale put on the mask he like Batman but when it was off he was one - sided . The reason I give it an 8 is because of the acting besides that it was very well made .

The  commentary  this film is simply an example of a particularly patronizing and superior attitude that many in the west display , writ large . So , I guess this film is brilliant social commentary .... if you are in the 3rd grade . On to goal # 2 . Being a good zombie movie . .... if being a good zombie movie that you sacrifice all scare factor in the name of  social commentary  ( see goal # 1 ) and turn the into poor , downtrodden that you are supposed to feel bad for ( despite their hunger for your flesh ) then this flick is GREAT . Even the  Dawn  remake was better than this pile of crap .",1

"I was by this film , seen it without of it before . Like other here , I the similarity to Magnolia , but since that is possibly my film of all time , I am unlikely to see that as a negative !

The emotional high  t forced or ( well , with the possible exception of the little girl :  I will protect you Daddy  - but who , I was at that point anyway !), and when it was done , I was left feeling incredibly by some of the most powerful . I do think the film will receive some criticism for what will be as overt  worthiness  or politically correctness , and I can see why in a sense , because there is just a hint of white middle class guilt edging in . However , I really  t see how this could have been done with a lighter touch , without losing the significance . To me it was about compromise more than just racism or corruption , how we all get chipped away at every day , and at some point we have to take responsibility for it , and change it or let it go on . There was redemption , but at a price , and even the ending , which had the whiff of cheese about it , left me smiling :) Oh , great too .",0
"Among the very best of the comic book superhero , up there with and Batman for quality . Casting was good , acting was adequate , special effects were tremendous . I hope my appreciation of the is not colored by how much superior they are to the 1994 dog of a flick directed by Roger . Aside from the title , the two have almost nothing in common . The plot line to the comic book story very closely , with the only major difference being that of . Doom being exposed to cosmic and along with our . While a fairly major thing , this did not seriously detract from the film story . There were other , such as Ben being married , but these did not have a big impact on the plot . I have it said that the story was somewhat juvenile , to which i say ,  It  s a comic book Superhero movie . you  t going to get Gone With the Wind , but you do get a fine and entertaining film . I haven  t of anybody who thought that they wasted 8 . 50 by seeing it . Personally , I it greatly , the film made the story come to life from the of Marvel . Probably the best of the superhero from Marvel , and overall only by the magnificence of Batman in all the comic book genre of . I heartily recommend . 8 out of 10",0

"I watched this movie and was speechless . and one - dimensional pop in and out of their in this disconnected mess . It  s as if the director / writer made the movie by to paste together every from disaster and action ... and then thought that by pasting these together everything would be . happen to people but , because no character and relationship development , you not only don  t care but you wonder if your brain zoned out and entire of the story . There are so many worn - out , from so many formula . We have the smart scientist in the antarctic who the standard selfless and  save mankind  speech . There  s the main scientist guy who to warn the and , of course , not attention to his son and the disaster now his mettle . We have the standard low - caste society guy ( homeless dude ) who people when the disaster comes ( and the standard message that we can find out what  s really important and how equal we are when normal society structure is ). There  s the policeman who these horribly canned and the authority , . . Now , I can take . I can even take canned . But in each of these , there  s almost no development - the father ludicrously to trek to his son who  s in ... and what should be a moving moment because of the father  s in the past becomes nothing because the and introspection of the father  t . Scene after scene like this -- the director to have these emotionally - where you  re affected but , because there  s no foundation , you don  t care . And ... if the tired  t enough , we get illogic at every step . I can go with a movie and accept that even bend reality but once the movie you to go with it , it also then play within the physical . The cold acting as if it were the blob in form of ice chasing them was ridiculous . The bureaucracy thing w / the scientist trying to get the message out was so silly that I kept shaking my head . The of some of the during the disaster made me realize that the writer to get across but to realize that it  t in sync with the context . I  stop here . A horrible waste of time .",0
"This is one of the best of the year because there  t any corny action like in all the other Batman . The were more real than in the other , except for the Scarecrow . The other Batman had make - believe like the Penguin , Bane , Two - Face and all of those . This movie had a lot of action and it was the first movie with Batman flying . I thought the movie was exciting and also funny and it really an for something since it was a decent movie . I think it will at least get nominated . This is the best movie of the year because it had good acting , , writing , and visual effects . I hope they make a Batman with as the Joker .",1
"I  that in general the movie more than men . I think that there was more of a love story in there than the other . I also thought it was a great movie , however it can not surpass the V and . It was also much better than I and . The first one was horrible and the second was good but  t give me the feeling of  Star . There  t any on Sith action and that  t feel like  Star . That  s why this one was so good , it had those epic they to put in the episode but it still had the saber and lots of them . The two were connected by and it was nice to see some familiar .",1
"First of all , I want to tell you that I have been one of Batman  s since I reading the comic . Actually I discovered Batman before I reading the comic , which is not that strange because I was born in the year of 1989 . When I was about eight old , I watched the first Batman movie starring . And yeah , I the humor in that movie a lot . I  t like the second movie as much as I the first , but it was yet a great movie . But when I watched the third and fourth , which was after I reading the comic , I really it . I  t understand why they to make such two bad when Burton did good with the two first . Although Batman & Robin was a bit fun , I yet it . And now , the fifth movie finally and come to the anywhere . This is the movie that the background story of how becomes Batman ... And it never been that good . It is than ever , but the mind of humor is still there , and is sometimes throughout the movie . You notice a few known - whose are such like , Morgan Freeman , , , Murphy , and . And of course , not to be forgotten , the star of this movie - Bale . Honestly , I think Bale is perfectly as alias Batman , probably also better than , who I  t really like in the first two .. But in here , I really feel Bale is the right one as Batman ... He a mix of with fear , power , charisma and revenge . But I have to admit that really is great besides Batman as his butler , and he is also the first who to know  s of becoming Batman ... and him in all ways , being like a sort of uncle for him . is really an excellent actor and he a proof of him being one of the movie  s throughout the movie  s history in this movie . It with as a little boy being by a lot of bats and how he is getting of it . Some days later , interrupting a Opera show because of his fear of bats , his being of a thief . He becomes powerless , making it his life purpose to revenge the one who his . But some incident 14 later him to hide himself , taking him to the criminal way ... and to a prison and finally to a mountain , where he a mystic man who him to accept his fear and to fight . Back to City , becomes  s worthy assistant and soon is able to characterize himself as Batman , City  s rescuer from falling in decline . With help of a police ( ) and an employer of Tower ( Freeman ) who knew his father , to save the city and surprise the and give them what they deserve . But it becomes a hard fight against decline . A great movie that is thrilling , amazing and magnificent as well as masterful . City like a version of , and , and is greatly and dark toned . The are great and is fitting as , her serious charisma making it realistic . But even though it is great , the background story much time but it is yet great to know the background story of Batman , when you only experienced a few of it in the first Batman movie with . This time it is different , modern , and more spectacular than ever , but I can  t say if it is better than the two first - but one thing is true and it is that the background story is greatly made and that the have never been better . Actually , everything is great and I can  t complain of anything bad in this movie , but I feel it is yet not enough to give this movie full grade ... something is missing . It is the third movie this half year that is based on a comic book - first it was Sin City , then it was Fantastic Four and now this ... Still Sin City is the best .",1
"again from the darkness . This documentary had two effects on me . First , the photography and scenery is stunning . Second , seem to have despite their lack of evolution . The magic of Antarctica is beautifully . The stark ice desert is amazing in its isolation and brutal environment . For whatever reason , for of emperor have made this same trek at exactly the same time of year to exactly the same place for the sole purpose of procreation . This isolated spot relief from most but incredible on mother , father and chick . I am no scientist , but it is a real head scratcher as to why this creature does something so difficult for them and made no towards a simpler or more effective method after all this time . As a movie watcher , I definitely the amazing photography as the of , mating and surviving are on film - some terrific close of these flightless . The photography what is a horrible score and less than exciting narration from the normally outstanding Morgan Freeman . Still worth seeing , although under age 8 will undoubtedly be . This one will keep you from ever feeling sorry for zoo - kept again !",1
"In this movie can  t save them all . Maybe it  s the age or he is upset for the Titanic sink - he surely would have saved it if he  d just accepted to play  s role :) Well , enough . This movie is actually good . It is like a cross between several of his , a mutant bred from Die Hard and Color of Night . You will also notice Ben Foster , a great role as the psychotic . You might remember him from Six Under . I think he a nice career in front of him if the darn casting people have any sense . The story is a bit overdone . I mean , we are used for to do the impossible in almost all of his , but in this one it felt as he was trying to get closer to reality . Well , he  t do it . It  s still too much , too big , too flashy , but overall a fun film to watch .",1
"I  t like this movie because the two main , Napoleon and Pedro , slowly and they  t have many . The movie was very slow and boring , and it  t really funny at all . There  t any action , either . I  t like any of it except the last five . The that were supposed to be funny were not really funny at all . I  t like any of the . The script was weak to the point of being lame . The quality of the actual film more like that of a B - movie . I also object to this movie because it to poke fun at people who are a little slow or mentally retarded . The relative of one of the made fun of his nephew , and reflected little family love or concern for the boy . This movie reflected poorly on family life and family .",1
"Brewer summed it up here : For many of us , creative expression and collaboration with is nothing new . But we must never forget that there are many in this world who  never been to express themselves with movement or or paint . Regardless of our given , we are all to contribute a verse . It is our right as human . A right that to you , to me , and to a country stripper Tequila . - from Landmark & Flow was very much about , , and , about the down - on - their - luck and the that often lay dormant ... deferred . once wrote  What to a dream deferred ? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun ? Or fester like a sore -- And then run ? Does it stink like rotten meat ? Or crust and sugar over -- like a syrupy sweet ? Maybe it just like a heavy load . Or does it explode ? In Hustle & Flow , this question and soon he the answer and it  s not a happy ending . That would have been too , to end of the rainbow and not the point . The question ,  What to a dream deferred ? to be with nothing but more . But take the time to analyze each question and you  get an idea of what and really about being . The  dream  is a goal in life . position is clear that any important dream or goal that must be can have serious negative . As the question we find out what those are . Like  poem , Hustle & Flow a possibility of each negative affect . The dream or life goal of a human being is central to what the human a valuable member of society , but suppose that person with the dream is told he cannot fulfill his goal just yet ... it  s a cycle of self - . I thought that the writing in Hustle & Flow was inspiring and the acting well done . I  been to and other like , , St . . I have who are living in the same as what people see on screen . Like they all ponder the question : What to a dream deferred ? Hustle & Flow us that to postpone one  s can lead to destruction .",0
"I out of the theater thinking just two ... ... who ? Stellar job ... consistent with the spirit and letter of key of the Batman critical to the character , and too easily brushed aside by the over - the - top of the Burton / franchise . Character , dialogue , story ... outstanding in all ( enough to draw some of the most talented and seasoned in the industry ). : keep , and Burton as far away from this version as is conceivable ... and no by West , please for the love of God ! :)",1
"to what I normally see come out of Tinsel Town , this is wonderful . One thing though , did you notice that past his fighter when she is working the heavy bag , she is winded , he her ,  you can rest when your dead , very ominous warning , also remember how the music very dark and when the champion comes into the ring . You just knew something tragic was going to happen . in the film character is talking about the style and fighting ability . They show her a fighter who is on one knee , then another scene where she on the other head and her to the ground , knocking the ref down also , they don  t show her throwing but she does in the fight challenger , this is very common in boxing , especially when are in close throwing at the head , they let there follow where the glove would have been , anyway you would have figured that would have this champion to do these again , but when she , her shoulder and elbow to knock down her challenger , then his the fighter while she is on one knee , totally at this and at her corner , then the fatal blow after the bell was horrible , it just odd that  t tell her to expect very dirty tactics and never take her eyeball off that woman at any moment . Although did tell his fighter to fight dirty right back as soon as he there was no getting around it . Everybody who watched that film up to that point was ready for fighter to become champion and live happily ever after , not so , and the way the movie leaves the fight game , with nothing from the other boxer or any kind of closure to the championship fight , nothing , not one thing , just a who her only friend to allow her to expire , thats tough stuff .",1
"I went into this movie with several . 1 : a great plot line with some well drawn we could care about . 2 : excellent action . -- not one , not two , but four and one of the great comic , Doctor Doom ? and 3 : outstanding visual effects , on a par with . Well heck . The were . I Alba  s no nonsense approach to Sue Storm , although she was a bit wooden when needing to be passionate . was good as Reed . He somehow the part . well and is enjoyable as the Thing . Who is this guy ? He was the best thing in the movie . Funny , a great sense of timing , a great sense of expression . He made the most out of his part and you could tell he it . However , all the action was in the trailer , and the best and were too . I could go on and on about the movie  s lackluster plot . The need for the to acclimatize to new was by The Thing  s angst over his physical , and the in his life wrought by his trip into space , disappearing in the matter of a second when his him to help them fight a boring evil Doom . Did we ever see a vicious plan by Doom to endanger the of everyone in the city , or on the planet , or did it just seem like he done before he ? Same thing with the movie . like it was finished before anything we really could sink our teeth into .",1
"Not a bad movie , but you know , I  t really feel much for the in this film . While the story is reasonably compelling , you see the wine by candle light after all the tension and they  re left in the hotel to manage the chaos . I mean , come on . What  s that all about ? Way too to actually produce compassion for the true story at hand . Everyone to go over this film , both at and other ( such as rental ), and it  s yet another film I feel is by at least 2 out of 10 . I gave it a 6 . It  t suck , but it  s not all that great either . I  t find the acting all that supreme to be honest , and while the story was important to be told , it  t told in a way that one with feeling for the or whom they  re . I  t feel as sorry for the as I did in many other , such as , The Killing , . They were far better , in my humble opinion . While this movie had its of sadness , it would often spoil the true story with these of  wine by candle light , which I found to be complete nonsense and totally unrealistic given the . Tantamount to drivel . I  t really think the movie got going till around 50 into the film . Sorry , but I  m a huge movie person and I simply can  t agree with the majority here .",0
", like her are going to slide off her face , but everything else in the movie was great . Who would have thought that would be as  the  Batman ? Bale was fantastic . He the build , the brooding brow , the spark of mischief Batman seriously . had it all but the build . Casting is everything in a movie , and obviously they went all out on this one . From ( on the side of the light , this time ) and ( who works in any movie and usually them better than they were before ) to and even a small part by Ken who in  The Last Samurai , the cast truly made the movie . ( Even ). And apparently much better in work than her . The plot was simple , yet elegant . We all know the story of Batman , where he came from , why he does what he does , and his backdrop , , and the crime within the city . We are given for the crime , another good performance by ( ) as  s father , and some great by the , especially Murphy as the Scarecrow . The plot is simple but seamless . There are and which flow smoothly . The action is great , the cinematography is excellent , with stark and dark at the same time . Truly a great experience of a long movie which could have been longer .",1

"Closer the beautiful people being beautiful , or , lying and their . Another Mike portrayal of beauty in emotional distress , i . e .; Ann , Ross , , Sandy , , Streep .

From , who directed several of the of the  60s and  70s some of the most atrocious and embarrassingly bad I can remember . All four are dishonest with each other and themselves , , manipulative , and tormented by their own awful , immoral behavior . When and Law first kiss she the shutter release on the cable she is holding as though it  s a metaphoric climax . I actually out loud . Portman is the star of what could be her breakout film . The story also well . Law  s character is alone and Portman  s waif was never honest or really him . Carnal Knowledge been one of my favorite since I first saw it in the .

"I have a somewhat different take from .  s . I think it a solid  B  grade , for Good . Not Excellent , but not lousy , either . The by , C . Riley , and Pete were , as , excellent , as you  d expect from such fine . What . does is to present us , through those wonderful , ordinary people in the kind of jaw grinding we all ( most of us , anyway ) have been through , and , in the midst of that to gradually bring in the Disturbing . He  t smash us over the head with it \u0097 no fiendishly grinning turning 360 by of howling . No . Dark water and creepy , and a hint of past foul play of the type we know may lurk here . I think it is precisely because of the equality with which both the everyday and the creepy that the creepy is given a kind of credibility different from the usual kind in horror . In an Exorcist type movie , for example ( to continue the comparison ), when the ordinary and the Spooky we voluntarily suspend skepticism so that we can be supremely out by the special effects . We don  t have to voluntarily do anything here . There  s no stepping out of the Ordinary into the Supernatural . By the ongoing of the ordinary and the creepy , we are into the creepy as it in , as it were . By the insistence of . that we continue to empathize with .  s character by the everyday nature of the ongoing story , tension - filled as it is , throughout the movie , we then have to accept all that she , as it is woven in at a level pretty commensurate with her real - life but then up at key . Of course , there  s the brief reference to childhood to cast just a bit of question as to whether what we are seeing is the product of an mind . But even that out both at the level of the conflict - ridden divorce she  s in ( he would bring that up ,  t he ) as well as the supernatural invasion she  s . Again , the of the ordinary and the creepy . I just saw it with my 15 year old daughter . We both it , and agreed it deserved a B .

"2001 is either confusingly profound or profoundly . Either way , I suspect , what we have on screen is due largely to the massive , widespread drug - use of the swinging when this was . I  m not . When and sat and watched the star baby scene , in the final few of their film one can almost imagine the exchange : :  Far out , man . :  Dude ... I  m seeing ... . can maybe also explain  s infantile fascination with every sequence , and why as a result we are forced to watch unfold almost in . For instance , when out the apparently faulty component . What to probably one sentence in the script to five plus of screen time . Is this effective ? Necessary ? Maybe , and maybe not . The film - as a whole and its individual - are strangely hypnotic . If it was boring then I  d simply turn it off . It  t . It  s compelling in a way that I can  t explain . Even completely superfluous and excessively long somehow kept my attention . I suspect , with the aid of they  d transcend  compelling  and become enthralling .

"I love this film . Need I say more . Coming from someone who never seen the stage production , I it . The music , the and , the set , the entire film was amazing . is one of the young around and she was inspiring and wonderful . She was perfect for the role of and did a phenomenal job . Butler  t seem to get enough credit from most people who have this film . He was the perfect , ideal Phantom . I see what Webber saw in him and to see . The Phantom to be sexy , yet mysterious and passionate . His voice was soothing and heartfelt . Webber could not have had a better cast . I  m glad he chose who  t that well known because it the movie more of a realistic truth . If he had well known , the film  t have made it seem so real . You have a certain image of what certain are like and with these , I had that . It was almost like I had it , only so much better . It all my and . This is one of the most amazing of all time .

"I finally saw   and I was and by the movie ! The film is perfectly cast ! , Will , , and deliver marvelously and complete a wonderful , impressive , charismatic ensemble . Like the wonderful romantic of bygone ,   me a feeling that gave me when I was very young -- I it to be absolutely true ! I enjoy and action , but I  m also a sucker for a good romance . This one me up with those , lightness of being in the chest , and wishing the story would happen to me .

I have enormous respect for the . , often in - writing with her sister , written and directed some of the best romantic in modern theatrical release .

I love  s style of comedy , with its romantic tension and tug - of - war between the romantic , with an ideal happy , feel - good . It may be predictable , but I  m also a sucker for happy . I sometimes feel if turn out badly for the lead . The touch that is experienced in  Sleeping in ,  When Harry Met Sally , and  You  Got Mail , to name three , is very apparent in  . If anyone does not like this film , then they should go see a movie where they blow something up . This movie is not a fast - buck caricature of the original television series , and yet cleverly the original series as part of the story . It  s a beautiful and respectful homage to ! Instead of ending or to replace the legacy of the original , this film  s memory . Will is a gifted comedic actor . He how far to push the envelope without losing the sympathy of the audience . He how to play a perfect jerk ( as he did in  ), and yet he cleverly comes full circle and we can  t help liking him when he the vulnerable and remorseful side of his character .

She is absolutely perfect and the and bewitching that was so good at , and yet them refreshingly her own . to amaze me and my admiration after many wonderful film .  s vulnerability , , with a dash of witch  s fire in her is a lesson to any Acting 101 student . Cute also is  s innocence in  s claim that she cannot act . That  s like  s character in  The Towering Inferno  he can  t dance . WARNING : SPOILER IN THIS PARAGRAPH ! is perfect as Iris . I mean that in the sense that the perfect amount of attitude that and I think that it was a great touch to make Iris a witch . But , it sense to blend the old with the new and come up with to make the role her own . I wonder if would think that perhaps Iris is sort of a way of making light of her more serious spiritual side . does have that wonderful twinkle in her eye as she to be mortal although Iris not to fully come out of the broom closet . I do believe , however , that I would have had Iris causing even more trouble and show that even a witch with Iris  s in cannot always resist the temptation of a little mischievous dabbling . With giant like and as on the screen , and all those many film to their , there was opportunity to have more comedy , romantic tension , and comedic plotting against one another , with a subplot to highlight these two talented . I also the / Uncle impression by who nearly stole the scene . I see where will be the next Maxwell Smart in a 2006 film release and his performance here suddenly my interest . The only other comment I would make , if constructive criticism is , is that I thought there were at least two that should have been re - shot because I thought the audio quality was not what it should have been . That  s certainly not anything that for which are at fault and perhaps that will not be a problem once the film digitally on . Hopefully , production also opportunity to tweak the technical of the film . One of the in this regard I in the theater is the first encounter and dialogue between Iris and . Overall this movie my . Often , based on , or of past are disappointing .   is an  A  movie , not a  B  remake . If any movie does not have an earth - shaking philosophical message , the intellect , is action drama , or an amazing true story , then it must in other ways be outstandingly entertaining . When I walk out of a theater and say I  d like to see it again , which for me does not happen often no matter how much I it , then I know the film struck my imagination in a very positive way .   .",0
"I  m so glad I  t waste money seeing this in the and until it came to satellite . I can  t think of a much worse way to spend $ 7 . 50 then to see this silly little movie . First , let me say that I did enjoy the Sixth Sense , Unbreakable , and immensely . They all were moving , well done that knew how to keep your suspense . Suspenseful are some of my favorite to watch and is normally a master at it . The  suspense  in this film around eerie in outside a nineteenth century village . The people in the village fear the but are safe as long as they don  t venture out into the . Of course , you know some of the , being naturally curious , will eventually wander out in the . So the do some to make sure the don  t do it again . Are there some hidden and involved with the and the ? Of course there are ... after all , it  s a movie . But there is no reason for me to even discuss the   involved with the , the village , or any other part of this movie , because they are just so unbelievably silly . Let  s just say that some are not worth $ 7 . 50 nor an hour and a half of your life to find out . The difference with the other 3 I above is that the involved with them were at least somewhat believable and so did not ruin the . I really hope from this meager effort and a little more thought into his next movie .",0
"M . Night made some of my favorite : The Sixth Sense , Unbreakable and . Now he written another movie that what is now known as the  twist ending , something he is becoming synonymous with in The Village . I  t dare give away the quick turn to the left the movie , but I will say , it to a degree . It is not a ridiculous ending , but what could have been if had his original premise of a 1890s countryside village by who patrol the surrounding . We get the usual eerie mood that given us before . The Village in the isolating feeling that we got in . I might be the only person to admit to liking , but I the battle between one family and . Here in The Village , we have one town , cutoff from the rest of society trying to battle a race of who their to even treat their sick and injured . The pace of the movie is slow and moody , especially through the orange tint and effective . The village is lead by a counsel of , Walker ( Hurt ) who is father to two , the blind Ivy ( ). Ivy a childhood fling with the local mentally man ( ) but up falling in love with ( Phoenix ), who is the first to suggest leaving the village to gain medical .

I don  t think I  m the only one . I was by the , and I  t like how dealt with them . Sure , there is a certain amount of interest and logic to how the movie out , but it could have been more .

"Long - time and business , and , are divorce . Although it  s rather that these two specialize in giving out marital advice when you consider their own personal outlook and approach to , or more appropriately , their lack thereof . In their spare time , and are seen their favorite time of the year , the busy wedding season , during which they infiltrate various marriage posing as distant , in order to snag any available female guest or bridesmaid in attendance , if for nothing more than the purpose of indulging in a brief bedroom romp . The latest wedding that the swinging set their on , is a highly event , since it is to take place within a family of remarkable status which is headed by the treasury secretary . To the outside observer , the family is a portrait of wealth and social prominence , but on the inside , it turns out to be quite a clan . There  s the needy , sexually - wife , the artistic outcast son who homosexual , the sweet - looking , but vulgar and gun - grandmother . Then , there  s and . soon himself falling for , who is obviously trapped within the of a potentially relationship . Meanwhile , himself wanting to escape the of , a spoiled airhead who becomes possessive and latching on to him . and have been in many previous together without actually being at the helm as a team , and I  m to see a continuation of this duo in possible future . They are two of a perfectly comedic structure which is further built to greater with the participation of all the other supporting cast involved , with noteworthy praise for sugary - sweet rising star and sexy bombshell Fisher who portray and respectively . There  s also an amusing cameo appearance by Will , who to be in just about every other movie these days , as a man who another type of traditional congregation in an attempt to meet vulnerable .  Wedding  is obviously intended for mature since it with nudity and sexual , and it to be explicit without to rely on the obligatory bodily function sight . But beneath all of the liberal , there a more subtle undercurrent of romance that the female demographic will be able to appreciate as well .",0
"It like a party movie , but actually its a sweet romantic comedy . Some funny . Two crash for to meet cheap . At a wedding with a rich well - connected family both fall in love . Many weird . I did not really care for the beginning , because two are not really very likable . It better when  s character the movie . Good by , and Jane . I the creepy gay artist brother . This movie some mild message about love being more important than one - night , but that message is not really well , and I think more will come away from this with clever for than will decide to build an enduring relationship .",1
"Much better than  ... a little better than  Unbreakable ... but not as good as  Sixth Sense ... Dunst would  done an admirable job in the new girl  s role , but an excellent performance ... her only apparent problem was a minor technical one , and only early in the film -- making her seem sightless by being  unfocused ... she to be looking straight at people in the early going , but by the time Phoenix  character was , she had it ... once again does a great job of leading you to make certain and take certain for ... a little more development on the elder  s   before they settled the village might  added a bit more contrast and  twist  to the , but the revelation itself essentially contrast enough ... the only thing seemingly overdone ... and it as if it were a last minute rewrite ... was the supposed   of the to disallow overhead ... again , the realization of what the  village  really was had clearly been established ... additional explanation a little to me ... Phoenix  role was supposedly written for him ; I had read where was the role but backed out when he learned of  s quirkiness ( THAT certainly a bit like the pot calling the kettle black )... either way , Phoenix the role his ... Hurt is excellent as the village leader , and Weaver is startlingly authentic as a very plain 18th century ... a major role departure for her in every sense ... Let  s hope M . Night in this genre ... nothing to be worried about yet ... but back on the right track after the train wreck that was  ... oh , wait ... that was  Unbreakable ,  t it ???",1
"I do not get blown away like this often , but Hustle & Flow is a perfect piece of cinema . Don  t shy away from this one because there are , , hookers , and . is the soul of Hustle & Flow , and his portrayal of a pimp who a passion for rapping is worthy . Every character is dead - on believable and every word spoken is poetry . I don  t care if they  re being stupid , funny , gritty , sarcastic , or violent , every ounce of this dialogue is delicious . the downside of his job to a prostitute ( Manning ), ( ), a vending machine stuffer , ,  I always smell like sticky and Skittles . The hooker ,  Wow , and I thought my job . That  s just funny ! The whole movie , though ,  t so light - hearted . The drama definitely you down , but the music you going . I usually don  t even like rap music , but I the music in Hustle & Flow because I understand where it comes from , and I care about these . In a summer full of uninspiring , this movie me that creativity and brilliance is still alive and well ... if not in , then at least in !",0
"Like and Elephant , it  s beautifully paced and . It my on that a person could take any frame from the movie , print it , and it on the wall . Van Sant  s painterly still move me after all these . At times it like Van Sant simply made up his own film - making formula and can now just substitute different and and ad a sprinkling of plot and story . It  s a good thing that it still works brilliantly after these last three . Although he barely three full , coherent throughout the film , still a performance with immediacy and strength to a character who , at this point in his life , neither . There are three musical in the film ( four if you count the shot of a a 2 Men video )... the first is Blake , apparently on a whim , one instrument at a time until each one is layered upon the , this incredibly powerful sonic improvisation . There to be no hesitation or deliberation going on , he just it , and then it simply . The second is one of the singing along to the brilliant Velvet Underground song  in . The last is  s own fantastic song  From Birth to Death . He down , a guitar , and the that he kept shut tight through the entire film . It is here that we see he is not just a burned out  rock and roll , but that he is brilliant , inspired , and real . Each of these are truly moving ... From Birth to Death  being my favorite ; this scene is an instant classic . I was worried that Van Sant would ham - hand Blake  s actual death , but I  t have been . It was poetic and touching . If this actually is Van Sant  s final film in his  young and dead  trilogy , it  s a great way to end it . While it of humor and levity to it , it more subdued than his other . Unlike the in or Elephant , Blake is a man who long ago accepted what he is going to do . And with that , he decided to take one last look around his world and immerse himself physically , even though his head is somewhere else . There is life inside of him that now in the between his body and his mind , and is only expressed through his music . It  s both tragic and amazing .  s story deserved to be told by a like Van Sant , and I  m glad he got to it first . Somewhere , sometime there will be an actual filled with , , and everything else that goes into a rock star movie . And while it could be more exciting and  true to life , it will be , and I doubt that it will capture what Van Sant here : the subtle beauty of death , out like a compassionate , lyrical ballad .",0
"I  m admittedly a very tough nut to crack on but this one broke the shell wide open . Most of the time I chuckle once and a while at best but I was in for the whole two in Wedding . It up there close to A Fish , When Harry Met Sally and Get Out Your in my book . An almost seamless film that stereotyped and them completely out of shape . There  s a touch of genius in the interaction between and that at the great comedy of Martin & Lewis , & and & . Amid their screwball and cynical they let reveal an odd but working dynamic that through the madness of their own . Fisher  s addition as the , sister is a great little entry more spice to the stew . This is a movie that easily could have into cheap visual and potty humor but to rise to the occasion and deliver a quality product . Even the sappy and predictable ending  t diminish its overall shine . A good , solid eight . I hope we see more of these .( , my brother - in - law is a wedding photographer and he this kind of activity is not only feasible , he it  s fairly common at large )",0
"I just returned from a sneak preview of Must Love Dogs , and I  t help but check my watch repeatedly throughout . I love , but come next weekend  s  , he will no doubt be calling his agent , against hope to be cast in something that will revive his career after this horrible misstep . It  s not his fault -- the screenplay is absolutely atrocious . It comes across as if written by a first - year writing student . Every scene is precisely on - the - nose , with nothing remotely approaching subtlety , character motivation , or any consideration save the single , straightforward plot . There are no to speak of -- every conversation in the picture is ham - directed toward its outcome . There is -- quite literally -- not a surprise in the entire film . ( And . clearly a lot for product placement ; they beat you over the head with its name .) Yes , it  s supposed to be a romantic comedy , and there are to be made for the genre . But the are forced , the comic timing is nonexistent , and the entire piece like a low - budget student film . Or -- as more appropriate given  s pedigree -- like a television producer himself in making the leap to the big screen .",1
"I saw the movie last night and I  t sure if i would like it ; needless to say I it immensely . The movie was very well written , the dialogue was very witty and funny . The cast was excellent . Lane & give outstanding . , and especially Plummer were wonderful . The story quickly and you got to know the rather well . The interaction between the  family  was heartfelt , very real . The dogs were adorable , kudos to the . Don  t miss this romantic comedy from the creator of Family . You will not be disappointed !!!",1
"I try to avoid superhero because they are usually formulaic garbage , but not this one . The casting was superb , the story was superb , the were spectacular as were the special effects . Bale as Batman was charismatic and realistic for a fictional character . Dare I say ? The Movie is necessarily violent but not overdone . This is dark adult fun . It is also about fear and knowing the difference between revenge and justice . This is a smart movie with a man in a superhero costume . You know a movie is good when you leave the theater and you want to become the protagonist ! Quick to the !",1
". , Bob , my future sugar daddy , the of all , what ? You  re still great , but I mean , this was just too average and not in your league at all . Sorry , I had to get that out . I  m very disappointed , everyone at my work told me that this was a great movie , and I  t that excited to tell the truth . These past few we  some  big surprise twist ending  : The Sixth Sense ( good movie ), The ( pretty decent ), ( Alright ), and The Village ( bad bad bad !). Now , not that I  m totally upset with this flick , I mean is becoming a fine actress . We have to admit , she is very talented for her age . She  s very believable and cute to watch . But a lot of this movie up to nothing and nothing to be excited or jumpy over . It a story , but it  t right . I mean , this is an A - cast : , , and Amy . I guess it just  t that interesting to me . If you enjoy these surprise , you probably enjoy it . But if you  seen one surprise ending thriller , you  seen them all , right ? I should take my own stupid advice . 6 / 10",1
"This in an agreeable film with decent chemistry between Lane and , a good supporting cast with real to play , and better writing than . The are twofold . First , there is not that much screen time for and Lane together or for alone . The man is funny and heart so why cut his part so much ? Second , the ending is not up to snuff . I wish the had worked a bit harder to tie all this together into a more satisfying ending . The last five are significantly lower in quality than what went before , which leaves one disappointed by an otherwise entertaining and funny romantic comedy .",1
"Hey it  s just another movie and it  t too bad really . Thought it would be a suck fest since really  t right for the part , but hey , it  s based on a comic book , so in a funny way , he the part . And yes I have read the . does his part of the be well . does a great job too . But you have to remember it is a comic book turned into a movie . The effects are great and there are a few that us away . The first part when the guy hit by the car is especially well done ! I think the effects add so much more to the movie and make it worth the rental price even if you don  t like the movie itself . I say watch it and form your own opinion ;)",1
"I just saw this flick to a packet house in and the entire audience , myself included was with every frame of this film . Every single beat exactly where it is supposed to . Every review I read about the music and the acting , but how about how genuinely funny this film is a way that few are ? They took the material seriously rather than it devolve into schmaltz or comedy . The direction is straight on , no , no showy . They take their time with each scene . Good story , perfect well . Witty , crackling dialogue . You can  t make this stuff up . And this to 8 mile is like to gold . A deeply flawed protagonist who is able to reach into himself and transform himself through the power of art , involve the disillusion with fame , consumer culture . This is everything a film is supposed to be . If it you feel good to knock this film , then you are a snob . If you think can make a better movie than this , then go ahead ! People who love love this film . This is what film is about .",1
"A lot of good have been said about this movie along with some negative . Overall I was very with it . As always there are that might have been done better but if they had been done the other way people would still have . I had great admiration for those who went on location . Even with all of the modern survival equipment that must have been a grueling time . The mistake could mean death . I  worked with people who have gone to the far north and they tell me how quickly one could freeze to death by a simple mistake . What struck me most was listening to as I left the theater . Various people were on how was at the * north * pole . As I hope most people here know , it is at the south pole . Also the breeding grounds were not at the pole itself but were within the antarctic circle ( without any sun at all ). Another , more understandable error I saw in was a reference to the aurora borealis . Those are the northern . The commenter correctly them the southern which are also known as the aurora . BUt I really had trouble biting my tongue as I one woman teaching the young with her that the lived at the North Pole . ON the positive side , I learned a lot from just watching . In the past I  mostly seen in still or briefly at a zoo . BUt watching them in motion and doing , I was struck by how truly birdlike they are . We have and the was a lot of resemblance in the way they move their head and do other between the little parakeet and the giant emperor penguin .",1
"Wow I had high about this film but I cant honesty give my up on this even though like she gave it her all . I guess thats the sad thing about this film She way to hard to say something yet the problem is nothing here is worth saying . Lots of together scene structure that was a product of less than good and uninspired writing .  t we all go that film period in the 90s where multiple story were a fad in ? Some of the acting like the little boy role is outstanding ( but content a bit disturbing ) off a good performance with a so so script . I guess one would have to chance this for yourself and see the film but I would wait for the to take that risk ...",1
"Perfect Perfect Perfect ! grown up but still us who he is with the constant t - and body length pea coat . Lane who always been one of my ever since Lady Beware just with the same beauty as she did in Under The Sun . She being over 35 and divorce look like a nice place to be instead of the old days when you were just  OLD . Together they make a movie that you want to be in love , again ! Plummer and to the cast just that getting old does not mean you are almost dying , but that you are just starting the next stage of your life ! The whole movie you want to kiss the person that you are with . Too bad they don  t let dogs into the theater . Sometimes they are better to kiss than your date !",1
"There is just no that this film unbelievable scope . Like of other have said , the special effects are momentous . They have a hypnotic affect on you , not because they  re exciting , they  t , but for the reason that they are just so beautiful to watch . Whenever I view a film the first thing I want to know is when it was made and consequentially there after I can view it in it  s proper context . I  t born in 1968 in fact it would be another 13 before I would start my own . If I would have seen it back then before man had been to the moon for instance or while the Cold War was raging , people were wondering if there WAS going to be a human race let alone what we would be like in the future . Nuclear Annihilation was a real possibility .... and then this film comes along . Something that people had never seen the of before . It must have been what many have said on these ,  a real experience . It is something that you stop and think , back then and now . I  just watched it recently after a number of and there definitely is a enduring quality about it . The it are still pertinent today and it still fantastic . The thing that is the way they make nowadays and who they are designed for . I mean do you really think sat back in his little chair on set and thought to himself  this film is going to be great for 12 year - to go and see on a night ... they can leave their brains at the door . Of course not . This film will only interest people who expect to be by film in what they watch . Sure you could re - cut the film and lose 3 / 4 of the running time and not miss anything important and technically it would be a better film . However that  s not the point of this film . The narrative and plotting are irrelevant . It  s the the film about , our , our future , our and that are the key driving of this picture . One of my I like to tell myself is this ;  You can  t tell where you  re going until you know where you  been . This film is a visual adventure through time and space . It does have its though . A lot of the are vastly overindulgent . They are just last too long . You could watch this on on x2 speed and it may be even better who . The is a problem but nothing that would be fatal to the viewer . And you have to remember that in 1968 you are meant to be in awe of the space spectacle you are observing and therefore to lap up every second of it . After all , if you  re doing something , why have a 10 second shot when you can have a 60 second one I say . It does grate on you severely from time to time though . Another disturbing aspect to is the . At times I felt like I had more empathy with the at the start of the film as they clubbed each other over the head to some of the supposedly   we meet later on . They have no human . They look human , they act human , they even sound human occasionally but I remain unconvinced . It me that you are meant to be telling the story of evolution of the human race and none of them seem to embody any of the you usually attribute to us . the computer had a better acting style and he was just a red light and a guy in a sound booth . And like I say the in the ape did a better job at the start then anyone else later on . I can totally understand why people don  t like this film . Everyone something different from their cinema experience . Unfortunately most people who watch nowadays seem to want all the not only but spoon fed to them in the process . 2001 does neither of these . It just you think , a lot of people don  t like doing that nowadays . said that , I myself  t rate it highly on my personal list because I find it a bit and self - indulgent . It also any real flow or continuity . Also , for me a good film to have I enjoy to . 2001  t have them , it good and but a little short in them . I say again the are superb , for the time and now . It just me strengthen by belief that still can  t offer the same realism and grounding a good miniature modal can . The better recent marry and however , too many solely rely on the power of their chips for effects . I may not particularly like 2001 but I respect what it to achieve and it definitely was a seminal motion picture . People who disregard it out of hand don  t fully that without it there would be no like Star , Star Trek , to The Terminator . Science fiction for nearly 40 now had its cinematic firmly within 2001 : A Space and for that this film will always have my firm respect and admiration if not my affection .",0
"Wedding  is the movie I  seen so far . The film is a tour de force . is good in his laid back persona we know so well . There are aplenty and the supporting are more than wallpaper to the and . and play 2 divorce who love to show up uninvited at for the free food and to pick up single . That is funny by itself . Add in  s hyperactive party animal we last saw in   and  s suave intellectual and it the comedy up a notch . This film was bust - a - gut funny for without being gross . Only one bathroom joke here . It was so nice to finally see a comedy that was at and not 12 year old . But that  t mean 12 year old were - there is some good looking topless through out the film . ,  s love interest .

In one scene where she is coming on to I thought to myself  . !!! and her inappropriate to during the film were shockingly funny . 2nd place to for best performance to go to Sack Lodge , by Cooper . Cooper the fine line of being an ass and being over the top . He a misogynist environmentalist who to hunt . That was humorous because most would think an environmentalist to be sweet and poetic all the time . Not Cooper and that was fun to watch . The story was predictable but the comedy me to ignore that . The film about 2 and while it does start to drag toward the end , the final allow it to end on a high note . and were the best when they but still had the best and best . should get some out of his performance and with dearth of good this year he should not have too much trouble .

"A very funny and charming movie in a 2005 Garner ( ) and Day ( Lane ) type romantic comedy . Lane is gorgeous as usual , and a stellar actress in any film but especially a romantic comedy , and in the part of she is tough and funny but vulnerable , a terrific portrait painted beautifully by Lane . is as good as it as a recently , unhappy man that a personal ad looking for a relationship that will  Get him back in the game . The two are immensely by one of Lane  s , and by , wonderfully an  older  woman friend of  s father ( Plummer ). I was to see the elegant , beautiful ( see the West Wing ) made to look older and disheveled in a smaller part , but she is a consummate actress and was terrific . If you go to the to be , see this film for it  s wonderful , sparkling duologue , and just good fun . You will leave the in a better frame of mind than when you !",1
"This movie was so Awesome . I myself throughout the whole movie . It was intense and was suspense and it was not predictable like some are . It kind of me of  The  but a hundred times better . Like the underworld where he had to put his in the bucket of water to get to the place of fire and evil Now that is what i thought was cool . How anyone could of been during this movie i don  t know , I guess they must be insane just everyone !!!. But I IT !!!! I could watch it over and over and over . It  t just make me suspenseful it also made me sad like when  s partner i thought that was sad I could of cried but it was not sad enough to cry but it was sad . I give you double up .",1
"At first I was skeptical about this film and had no of watching it . Not only was it romantic , it  t seem that it would entertain me as much as I would like . But with all the less than mediocre coming out of movie today , I was willing to take a chance and sit down open minded . And I have to say that I honestly this movie . It was the best I  d seen in awhile . It was hilarious , cute and sweet and it made sense . This  t some big budget romantic comedy that only about style , sex and satisfying what the hungry sex - crazed public at times . ( Or at least what they think we want ). It had a point and was moving . was wonderful and I think that she is no doubt one of the best out there . was extremely beautiful and touching as usual . I personally think that Perry is a genius . They don  t make like this . Especially - . There  s more to the culture than , , sex and rap music . And unfortunately , the media  t show that and rarely did in the first place . I was also with the fact that the movie used black instead of the trend of rap who lack acting talent but can bring in an audience because of their name . It was finally good to see a movie like this this . Great job to the cast and especially to Perry .",1
"Alfonso that the film  t need to be 3 - 4hrs long ; well I have to admit he may be correct ; the only problem is he forgot to explain what the hell was going on ? He said that a novel - to - screen adaptation is the viewpoint on how to best tell the story . Well that  s fine , but you still need to actually tell the story . Don  t you ? Not one person , who saw the film , without reading the , understood what was going on half the time , and the few sub - he left in  t in any way , shape or form that could be understood but an outside observer ! So  t that contradict his whole Viewpoint theory ? was just showing off his excellent film making ( No I  m not being sarcastic !) and decided to say F *# K YOU to all the Big Name by making a Art - House style Blockbuster , which would have been great , if he had to pay attention to the actual story , instead of just on all the stupid he chose to shoot instead ! Don  t get me wrong they were amazing , but so much time consuming crap was put into the film , that could have been spent on , you know , Harry Potter instead of showing off to the world that he  s an excellent director ... WE KNOW YOU ARE MATE ! YOU  T HAVE BEEN HIRED FOR THE JOB IF YOU  T ... He made some excellent & much to the , and we all must be grateful for that , but by trying to make a more intelligent film , ( Which he did ) he us of many wonderful aspect of the Harry Potter world ! we were all looking forward to being brought to life on the big screen ... And as if that  t bad enough , he convinced Mike to make ( Which is the same size as 1 , 2 & 3 , combined ) into a 2 1 / 2 hour movie !?! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don  t let him near another Harry Potter film ever again !",1
"This movie is so WEIRD I can  t help but love it ! This kind of disturbing absurdity is rarely seen outside of a film . But here it is ! Writer / director / star made a movie where every single character is either certifiably insane or simply in love . Maybe that  s the point . Maybe it  s supposed to show us how we  re all completely out of our when we fall in love . No , on second thought , these people are all just total nut ! as , a single father and shoe salesman who his hand on fire for the pure amusement of his two sons who spend far too much time chatting . His six year - old unknowingly some crazy sex with a complete stranger in which he   back and forth with her ( don  t ask ). All the in this film are doing they  t be doing . Yes , Me and You and Everyone We Know is insane at times ( , most of the time ), but at the heart is a beautiful love story worth out .",1
"This is one of the worst that I have ever seen . I am a big fan of sarcasm , and love and Family Guy . This movie had a very thin plot , bad voice - , was loud and grating on my . I the movie to be witty , but it was not . It  s humor to the most juvenile of ( much like the true war that Bush waged ). I watched the first 30 and may have once or twice . This movie in my opinion is the most over - rated I have ever watched . For the life of me , I can  t see why it received such good . Any knuckle head could have written such a poor story . I would advise any one to save their money , and buy some ice cream during this hot hot summer .",0
"The movie was a remake , so I went in there a letdown . I am the kind of guy that some to remain the same , forget the times . I thought they did some good by not ( the manager ) smack Joey ( his ) on the mound . It IS 2005 , and you just can  t show something like that . Or the drinking REAL beer at the end ... I accept that too . But there are some that  t ring true to me . Why did they make Kelly # 5 in the movie ? That stole something important away from me and all the other . That final inning , he comes up and is , that  s one of the great of anticipation in sports movie history . You KNOW he is swinging away anyway , and that announcement you realize who he is ... How good he is ... How IMPORTANT this at - bat is ... But they get the number wrong . Several were wrong , but this one is the most glaring . Tanner , as ,  t use the same colorful as in the original . In a world , it  s that he would be a little more tame ... But ANYONE that saw the original and that Tanner can NOT be tame because he is the epitome of attitude . To  water - him - down  is a gross injustice , and he should have been a foul - mouthed little bastard that fought more people than just . He kept going after him , and not the whole team . They could not have let him be the original , agreed , but why did he play second base ? Tanner is the SHORTSTOP , which is the perfect irony because he is terrible and his position is the most vital in the infield for a team that so many right - handed . There is no / . The brain of the team , the scout , the first one to get on base with 2 - in the last inning of the championship . That weird a sort - of - afterthought role , but it is . The little speech of being  0 - 14 and next to Lupus , probably the worst player in the league  was gone from the movie . The time it was in the original was DETRIMENTAL to the plot , and the comeback with the proper perspective .  t bunt , some weird new did ... Little is supposed to walk because of his size ... Um , where was that ? Kelly is supposed to bat last , with the bases and 2 away . Why is that there ? Kelly slapping a hit in inning and being on - base is like the end of , but that is no , let alone Kelly Leak . The , , , , whatever he is should be on the cutting room floor . Lupus making stupid ... He eats poop I think I ... What have they DONE to the underdog hero ? He was a quiet , shy that had a moment . He  t even a - eating moron now , he eats poop and is too weird to be a factor in the hearts of any . If I were Smith , I  d try to sue BIG TIME . Anyways , he  t even get to make the catch to redeem himself . He that too , and this Hooper it . I get it , Hooper = Looper , Gay for the pun ... Yank , yank on my lower extremity . A ... , it was funny ... But you stole the glory from Lupus . He no respect from the public now . Hooper should have been , and that role . Let him bat in the sixth , and get when a ball his chair or something ... Then he super - speed on his chair or something and on  s bunt after stealing a base or two ... The girl that .  t they cast a flat girl with some ANGER in her acting to play the ace ? This had no spunk , no attitude , no talent for acting . And the bra line was lost because of her body . Period line ? Cheap replacement . I did like the ending between Buttermaker and , them being friendly and maybe a bit tender . Better way to see them ride into sunset ... Although the dugout scene with her arm in ice was , considering what they  t or  t say in this day and age . Kelly and kiss ... BULL . A terrible thing . Since she won  t be in a sequel ( BETTER NOT BE , DON  T MESS THE SERIES UP MORE ,) why tease us ? There are so many other I have with this movie , but there is not enough time or space to list them all . Yeah , I  buy it on when it comes out to add to my COMPLETE sports movie collection ... But I guarantee it will remain sealed . I  t let anyone that saw the original poison their with it . The thing that me most angry though , is the fact that in 10 or so , I  be telling my or some ( I coach baseball actually ) about how anyone can make a great play . I  bring up the and say Lupus or something , and the will say  the in the ? Or after a loss , I  say that some are just wrong ... Like Kelly in the last at - bat , and they will argue and say it was some . I hate that most growing up today won  t see or know about the original movie . This piece of crap is all they will know , and it is just WRONG to pass this off as the same . It a lot of detrimental that shaped the movie , and that should never be forgotten . the original in for us , that would be fair . The movie would kick ass these days , and great . Do it and make a fortune , as well as cool me off .",1
"I saw this piece yesterday at the cinema , and I have to make clear to everyone that I have never been especially into by Frank Miller . I guess I have never really give it a fair chance . Anyhow , the piece totally me . I love that the movie is generally in B & W except for some , and that really a neat  comic feel  to it . I guess the the feeling of being exposed to a comic , as the whole piece really did feel like a comic , at times me of the movie in the game  . I think that the story is told in a superb way , and the ( impressive cast !) don  t really surprise us , as we already now what these are capable of . See this today , you won  t regret it ! 8 / 10 !",1
"Score out of 5 : Zero . The show  t that classy , but it was a lot better then this drivel . At least it was not as boring and as seat numbing as this mess of a film . In this film , there is not any connection between the . In fact , there does not seem to be anything that made the show so wonderful ; actual . I saw this film during this afternoon and there were many times when I felt like walking out but did not because I thought the film would improve . How wrong was I . I did try to find some good in it , but I  m sorry I just could not recommend this to anyone , even when available on .",1
"Some funny , but in general , I found this movie to be absolutely pointless . 90 of my life that I can  t get back . The lead woman was -- I  t like her and  t care what with her . I went to see this film because I was told ( by 2 different people ) how it was a  must - see . I think I need to make some phone ... Will someone please tell me why this would be considered a  compelling  movie ? When it ended I sat there , wondering what I had just watched . I the boy though . I thought he did a great job , and he was just too cute for .",0
"This is a classic film , that  s amazing visually , with fantastic , however it  s too slow for my liking . I really got into the film at times , however the pace is really inconsistent , and some of the really me , plus it ended a little bit abruptly for me . The finale is absolutely spectacular , with some incredible jaw dropping special effects , and all the were fantastic , plus the are amazing . The opening is very interesting , and the story while incredibly slow at times , is very good , plus is extremely creepy !. is simply amazing in this , and  s direction is masterful , plus the were all very interesting !. The Set are amazing , and i was out of my seat by the incredible special effects and , plus the score was brilliant !. This is a classic film that  s amazing visually , with fantastic however the pace was just to slow for my liking still it  s a must see for any film fan , i just found the pace to be terribly inconsistent . The Direction is amazing for the most part !. does an amazing job here , with incredible , amazing camera work , jaw dropping , incredible effects , it  s well written , however if only he kept the pace more consistent ! it would have been perfect !. The Acting is fantastic !. is AMAZING in here , he is extremely likable , vulnerable , extremely convincing , his conflict with was rather creepy , and was really intense amazing job !. and Sylvester both do what they have to do very well and were both very likable !. Rain is amazing as the voice of , he was extremely creepy and he me at times . Rest of the cast are great . Overall this is a must see for every film fan , if only for the pace !. **** 1 / 2 out of 5",0
"Clever . Very clever . Much of Frank Miller  s original comic book feeling is here , but even more sophisticated . The are in a way , but the are strong . The interesting thing is not the violent vigilante , but the about love . Love is complicated here . It goes far beyond what you find in ; even in the of Frank Miller . You get interested in these people . Their vigilante might be as completely primitive , but their love and are from life . once again that he is a really talented actor . Usually he it well , but not here . See this , if you can stand lots and lots of yellow and sometimes even red blood . There is sun sometimes even in Sin City .",1
"Sin City is fully based on Frank Miller  s graphic - series of Sin City . The movie  s story is from three , 1st , 3rd and 4th . Visually the movie perfectly like the graphic . Black and white picture and only some certain are . Like or blood . The cast is another perfect thing in Sin City . The look just like in Sin City . For example Alba is fantastic Nancy , living image of and is true . They did everything to make the movie look like Miller  s and they in it . Only one bigger thing is different . In Sin City when a story another but in the movie they put two a bit smaller main between the biggest story  s beginning and end part . Why this when everything else is just like in graphic . And about . can make very different kind of . In Sin City  s mark is best visible even though the script is strongly by Miller  s . Q . is as a special guest director . It  s like a mark from the film that  this is a really good movie . Knowing and Miller  s Sin City , they  t need it . This even if it  t marked with film  s biggest name .",1
"from previous , opinion is divided on this film -- most people seem to love it or hate it ... Certainly if you  re laugh - out - loud comedy you will be disappointed . The comedy here is much more quirky and perhaps even whimsical . And if you  re a movie with a brisk pace , you will be forced to change and sit back and ( hopefully ) relax and enjoy . The first hour of the movie is really quite slow . Eventually , though , the somewhat convoluted story - line to cut in , and pick up , until we quite warm to the odd character that is . In the end we actually with him . ( of also come to mind at several .) Tasteful of a series of Bowie ( many in ) the movie along and to its exotic flavour .",1
"In a futuristic world , a strict regime war by : , art and music are strictly forbidden and feeling is a crime punishable by death . I understand from the what message the movie is trying to give . But as far as I see it is just simple mishmash of - fi . I mean look at the those silly action . A man who is trying to save the whole futuristic world with his own ! Come on even the are more realistic . obviously made a movie where free thought been , an world typically . But if you have ever read and have seen any related movie on his works you can easily understand that this is not the solution he in his works . Yes he such a world but he  t refer to a to save this world . Well action may like this movie but for meticulous I just say that they will be really with the typical action .",1
"I about how funny this movie was , original , brilliant , and all I could say it was the most boring movie I have ever seen . I  t believe I was only 15 into this thing when it felt like 45 . The    t quotable , the are annoying , cant convey any emotion , and if I to watch , I would stand in front of my microwave . Every character , no expression , and there was not one likable person in the entire movie . I  t stand the lead character , a High School Student like he  s a 7 year old . Was he supposed to be mentally as well ? I know on here wrote that they knew people like this , which is scary , I think this is the same pool of they get Jerry Springer from , and who in their right mind would want to know these people ? I understand that they were living a boring life , but why should I be watching it . When I saw the one character buy a time machine off the , I was thinking they should have gone back and this movie from the beginning , with different , a different script , ( I am assuming there was one ? I  t see it ) and this whole movie altogether . have said this was like Python and South Park . Python and South Park are great , the humor is on many , so intelligent people can get it , as well as those whose humor is that of Napoleon Dynamite . While watching those people are laughing for different . Here , are made like they are funny when they  t , unless ANYTHING a is funny because a is saying it is your style of humor .",1
"I went to see that at a sneak preview today in New York . My and I both really it . The film a very simple but there are a few along the way that make it not too predictable . It was very very funny and and flat out hilarious in . The film overall is very entertaining and a real uplifting feel to it . Lane was great in the lead role of and was also very good in the quirky comedy role he does so well . Everyone to like the film and we will possibly see it again with .  Must Love Dogs  is very , very if you want a good and entertaining time at the . 10 / 10 and a real treat .",0
"Just returned from seeing a sneak preview of this . I love Lane so I was for a little laughter . I was not disappointed . This to be the , , , and best movie I have seen in . The lovely Lane was marvelous as the recently woman back into dating by her meddling - but loving and close to her as skin - . is the guy who really nothing and over - everything . The supporting cast was superb and all believable in their the dogs . I read hear that it been done a thousand times and one would have to love dogs to like this dog . It may have been done before but not this well . The was believable , the real and the story sweet if predictable at the end . The audience ( in a full theater ) as one and even said all together a couple of times . Perhaps I was to like this flick but the reaction of the audience was enough to convince me I was not the only one who found this an outstanding night out . Go early and go often , Must Love Dogs is a superb and side splitting night at the .",1
"It  s been a long time since I  been to the and had a genuine feel good laugh . This movie is fabulous ! I the movie but almost got as much enjoyment listening to the audience laugh out loud as well . We took an single guy with us and he the movie . Lane as usual , a honest performance . The supporting cast is awesome . How great it was to see Plummer . A movie to enjoy whether you are single or not and a even better one if you think love will never happen . It almost made me regret never participate in on - line dating . This movie is a must see . Take the chick flick label off , it must never be associated . Drag your and . A great feel good movie of the year !",1
"Must Love Dogs I saw the sneak preview . If this  t become a after wearing out the theater circuit , I  be amazed . The script is hysterical . The is first rate . The ( every one of them ) click with one another on screen . I  d have to stretch to find something not to like . Maybe the hackneyed story line if I had to cite something ; but who comes to a romantic comedy breakthrough drama ? The plot : Lane ( ) is a recently preschool teacher whose   by her family to get back in the dating game . Since she  s not anxious for another heartbreak , her devoted post an ad in her name something along the of  Voluptuous \u0096 sensuous - alluring and fun . special man to share star lit nights .

After the three predictably push back on # 2 , becomes a fountain of romantic wisdom ( after more than she could remember ) to keep the on track . Also , keep an eye on Spiro \u0096 who the stereotypical - with toward the end . She - like screen presence which could spell  big future ahead . An enjoyable character to wrap up a delightful movie . I guarantee you will like this perfect date film . 8 out of 10 , for tickling the funny bone .",0
"This is the Batman I have been waiting for ! Burton  s Batman ( Batman , Batman ) were good Burton , but not great Batman .  s ( Batman Forever , Batman and Robin ) I  m convinced were made to mock the Dark knight and destroy his good name . But this new one is everything Batman should be and needs to be . And the are all to perfection ! is my favorite director and this ( along with Memento ) is his best work . If you see no other movie this year , see Batman . Note : This is not a to Burton  s Batman . This is a completely new Batman movie series .",1
"I remember seeing this movie on , and the say  goes home  and I and decided not to watch it despite all my and their . It came on on last week , though , and I decided I  t be out of any money if I did watch it or anything ...  t have anything better to do ... Oh man . I was just blown away . It was such a great movie . The dialogue , the , the ... they were all perfect . I could not find one fault except that we never found out what  s were about , but in the end I  t care . Sam and were the perfect couple - they fit perfectly , more than any couple I have seen ( save Bennet and . ). was talking a lot of bull when he got on the plane and I thought he like a stupid who no idea what he  s saying and I thought  damn , , you almost had me - but then he went back to Sam , with a perfect explanation . and I and got teary eyed because I want a ( no pun intended ). I still can  t really talk about it and not ramble . It was just so fantastic and a definite favorite .",0
"The best batman movie with some minor but overly enjoyable . One point that  t make sense was the water - how come it only water in the and not in the people ? Thankfully I could suspend my disbelief on that point to enjoy there rest of the film . The , for example , was a classic big of film hardware design and the acting was consistently enjoyable all the way through ( drafting in Morgan Freeman and Cane was cheating ). Well worth the money to watch - well worthy of a Batman , or what ever it  s and the Fantastic Four look like a flat pack to this towering construction . Good plot , excellent build up and ending that  t fall totally flat ( increasingly rare these days ).",1
"this movie had a lot going for it , Billy Bob and . But the lame and the plot made it just another dumb remake . Billy Bob  s performance was so strained it like he was doing a bad impression of himself from  Bad . There was a few funny but not from the main star , but from his younger supporting cast . The young cast to upstage by spinning out vulgar and disgusting that actually make you laugh . There  s a good side plot with and his daughter that a dramatic side to the film . Overall , unless you want to spend money to watch a so so comedy go watch Wedding instead .",0
"Looking at this film and the first trilogy you can  t help notice a simplicity about the first three and also how the first three where more human . This film much closer to the whilst still suffering from some of the over blown of the first two . Going was a good move , it more weight to a series that originally was based upon the feel of a morning western . The best of the first three by far , not up to the strength of the main  star  film , it to be said , even with all the special effect .",0

"I am a fantasy fan , first and foremost . While I  read my share of comic , I  m certainly not a big fan . So you can believe me when I say it came as a surprise that Batman went right up there into the top 3 - 5 list of the best I  seen in my life . Something even  t do , even if they too are near - perfect . Everything about the movie is top - notch . Acting is superb . Although I was of  the ever - teen  , she actually perfectly . She  t even look like a teen to my . Bale  t really a surprise , as I  seen several of his before . He was perfect , and I mean perfect in a way that obviously there  s not a person alive who could  done a better job . All the familiar from to to ( and obviously Morgan Freeman ) did their well enough for me to see no room for . I was actually pleasantly by the good  action star  s very peaceful and civil role . Seeing him actually made me think that he might take the place of these other older legendary about to leave the movie business for good , he the sort of calm authority and presence I  d not really before . Murphy was the one guy I had never of before , and considering he every bit as much a teen as normally does , he perfectly as . Crane . Too bad I can  t draw a comparison to his other from before .  s music goes beyond its usual supreme quality . Last time I music of his this good was in The Rock , and this was actually better . It  s a good thing , considering many of the modern have actually disappointed with their , which is something I despise . Music is a * HUGE * factor in the right kind of feeling and immersion for a movie , and I  m glad it was well understood and with Batman . Most noticeable of all the in this movie however , is the constant realism . And it goes than what you would normally expect of a movie . The sound - effects , you see , are better here than in any other movie I remember . As someone who  s been in the army , I feel I can definitely say that the and here are extremely realistic . Not the usual soft bass you have in , but the real strikingly hard . This same trend to everything . I actually felt a chill go down my spine just from the sound the of the bat - car were making ... something different from your usual  !. When and start breaking apart , it won  t be the usual dumb where there should be none . This world is like it really should be , in ways you can  t imagine before you see it . And on an unconscious level , it immensely to the immersion . The way Batman his equipment is done in a manner that  s not only supposed to look  cool , it  s actually supposed to show the audience how it all works . Batman its spectator two : First , it constantly you information on what Batman does , how he does it and why , to make the world believable . Second , it all that information it  s given you to draw you in and understand how frightening , how real Batman really is . It you see the world as if you were watching it from within the movie . And this works amazingly well . But I must give a word of warning . If you  re unable to immerse yourself with in general , you might have trouble with this . The difference with Batman and your typical movie is that everything here a purpose . From the somewhat to the overly dramatic  acting  by as Batman , it  s all intended . And if you are as you should be , you  understand their purpose and why it is indeed realistic for these to be as they are in the movie . If you are , your enjoyment will only increase with these . Some however have found them disturbing . But then , I could never understand why someone should go see a superman movie only to then start over how they  t like the fact that the hero was actually flying . My short conclusion is this : I went to Batman , waiting for something big . As Memento a tad bit too simple ( read : not to inspiring or mentally ) considering the type and style of the movie , I  t know what to expect of . I was however happily . I don  t cry in , ever . But when I left the theater after watching through the ending , I found my moist . This is definitely one of the best ever made , and * the * best superhero movie ever made . The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 , is because nothing is perfect ( main plot ), even if this was the of everything I  seen thus far .",1

"I gave the remake a 6 . I consider the original a 9 or 10 . As a the original was as close to the actual Little League experience one could get . Growing up in the 70  s and seeing the original as a over the , made me appreciate the original more and more over the . Tanner is one of my favorite in moviedom . The new version while very close to the original , none of the spirit of the old classic . All of the fail to live up to any of the original  s grit and toughness . The new Tanner is a joke . He like Tanner , like Tanner , like Tanner , but he is not Tanner . Same goes for everyone except for maybe the Lupis character . He was passable . Billy Bob was and still is the only choice to play Buttermaker , but even he can  t pull this one off . There is just no reason for this classic . The in the wheel chair was just ridiculous .

"( ) suicide ( go direct to Hell when this ) when he was a boy and was brought back in a deal with Heaven to send who have crossed the line ( to our world ) back to Hell . By doing this he is trying to work his way back on the path to Heaven . Why he was brought back is not known but he the ear of both Heaven ( ) and Hell . Now , too many are crossing over and the Devil is up to something not agreed to with God . The title of this could have been The Spear of Destiny as some believe that when he was by the soldier . Whoever this spear the world . The spear was lost , of course , and found for this movie . It  s impact was short lived and it  s easier to name a sequel 2 , rather than the Spear of Destiny 2 . You may remember , but not the short lived spear that really  t have the impact I thought this story would give it . This story was too much concerned with sending back to Hell . I think the sequel will have more to do with the Spear of Destiny . I can  t wait . Can you ? If the sound on my version was any better I might have this more . Sometimes it was very difficult to make out what a character said . You would think that a little rewind to go over the audio again and again would have , but it  t  the countless times I rewound . Those who watched this in a movie theater really must have gone crazy with  what did he say ? But , I got the idea and that is enough , I suppose . Maybe I just had a bad . Maybe . However , everything was good , the acting was good , the cinematography was outstanding and a few me when I least it . Those I clearly  t you know .

"This movie is not a ending , thank you very much . This couple needs a break from their and cell , sound familiar ? Most endearing is the relationship of this couple as we look through our own eye , we see ourselves . The director skillfully for a real life experience and successfully it home ; that fact the audience . As the movie to unfold , the audience is tense and on edge as if , the director cast the audience as part of his movie . There is a strong sense of hope that stays with the audience all the way to the ending . The movie is tough on our of how should be . Nevertheless , life is this way . Did the audience feel she gave up ? This is what this movie memorable and us to ask that question , what would we do in the same situation ?

"I seem to be the only one ( on , at least ) who so , but I felt that this film was a minor masterpiece . , I haven  t seen the original version , so , you know , everything I say is suspect , blah blah blah . I just thought that the film was astonishingly well - directed , that they  t wuss out on the or the sexual stuff , that it had a good message , and that the film was painfully realistic . I mean , have you ever been to a Little League game ? It  s . If you will permit me to digress a little , I once saw a man at a Little League game holding an umbrella . It was , obviously , but the were still , the umbrella man  s presumably older son , since the fellow was sitting next to his younger one . The tried to grab the umbrella from Daddy , or possibly just move it closer to his own body ; I  m not entirely sure ( I was sitting behind them ). Anyway , the umbrella , and Pa , apparently mad at something , the  s hand and ALL THE DAMN WATER OFF THE UMBRELLA AND ONTO THE  S FACE ! crying , and IT  S HIS FAULT ! What a horrid jerk ! Anyway , the Bad News is a damn good movie regardless of its remake status , and I encourage everyone to go see it , because it really is a superlative example of popular film - making .",0
"Saw this movie as a preview last night . I think they have a real winner . Perhaps even a major hit . Good movie , strictly a chick flick . Some excellent writing . Some very clever banter and very funny . Some of the plot not credible and off , and the overall premise is fairly corny , although with some original . The and are adorable , and add good color to the movie , although generally slobber a lot . Setting to be in a combination of Boston , Boulder , LA , and San , with blue collar living in modest with lavish . Must be nice to be in grad school , living in a trailer , and driving a M3 convertible . But Lane is utterly winning , classy , and stunning , when she is not rather convincingly looking a little dowdy and aging . is really  on . The chemistry between and Lane is palpable . To me , but not the other three with me , a point of lack of credibility was that Lane  s character would have any ambivalence or uncertainty toward the character . The camera them both . All of the supporting acting is great , particularly as the brassy of the father . That would have been an easy part to leave two dimensional , but is / deep . is completely credible and engaging as one of the trying to get Lane back into the game after a divorce . Plummer is perfect as the father -- handsome , loving , wise , and sad . The Lane character  s entire family is sweetly supportive and believable .",1
"I really hope that the production crew fired the boom operator for Buttermaker  s beer box . Nearly every scene the boom mike visible in it and one scene even had part of the other equipment ( camera lens / shadow box ) visible for the entire scene . And if it  s not bad enough to see the black mike hanging overhead like the sword of , they the mike with the sheepskin on it into one scene , me of someone holding by his over the scene . One close up scene of one of the had the mike just from his head ... I would have been nervous , myself . And in reference to the filthy of the ( and realizing that not everyone my sense of ) I personally think the of these little should have been for child abuse , as well as the crew who made them talk that way . And someone please -- get a sheep - shearer in here for Tanner  s  hair ... that was the worst wig I  EVER seen on a human .",0
"I did like the film . I thought it was scary and in - depth and was on the edge of my seat or squeezing my hand for a lot of it . I it up the the very last 4 or 5 . I the fact that we thought she had got out and but we find she is still in the cave . Then she about her daughter again and a smile on her , like its the end and she it but she  s with her daughter so its . The only thing that struck me as weird was when the camera out and we saw her in a random alcove in a massive cave face and then there  s a random scream . This is all very ambiguous and theatrical . are usually finished with a definite question or ending but this felt random and not physically realistic when the rest of the film was .  t she fall down a hole to land where she was ? How did she get there ? It  s a small thing to moan about but the ending can make so much difference to a film .",1
", after I saw this movie last night I thought it was an awesome movie , but as an avid sports fan was very disappointed in the boxing ( as were many on this board ). The I speak of are - people getting when they are down , after the fight , . ( basically all the cheap crap that went on , that would never happen in real boxing without the boxer being ). However , after thinking about this movie over the past 24 . s there is one scapegoat . I was thinking back , and that this entire movie was through the of  s daughter ( who is reading the letter ). The unrealistic that during the boxing could have just been her interpretation of what she was reading . For example , Freeman  s character said ,  she was known as the fighter in the ring .  s daughter may not know a lot about boxing and may have taken that as throwing people down , punching people when they are down , . This could also explain Swank  s  over the top  family that other were about - saying that  t have been so over - dramatic with how they were . All of this may have also been exaggerated by  s daughter  s interpretation of what Freeman wrote in the letter . If you  read this post , what do you think ? Any possible truth to this ? If not , then the movie is just a bad boxing movie , and the should have done a better job of their homework on the boxing .",1
"I this movie . The are amazing and I never knew what the went through to find a mate and become . It me realize how truly amazing these are and how disappointing we are . The G rating does miss the real point of them . There was so much left unexplained due to the harshness of Mother Nature . I feel a certain anger knowing how much pain can be to these little , so innocent and so pure . I must say , if the director would of in more on this , I don  t think many people would have been able to sit through the movie . I know I would of probably cried my out . It  s funny , I can sit through any horror movie and have seen real human death , but this , like the baby harp , is very hard on the soul . The difference being the are not by , some of them in this movie suffer such pain that  s almost sadistic and me want to scream at some higher power for this happen .

"and the only time they come into contact is by crash . And with these Haggis open the box of CRASH , one of the most vital and important of the year . This is a film that prejudice , racism , fear , hate , bigotry , random violence and all of those we people of the have to isolate ourselves from the world in which we live . In Haggis  every possible form of based on ignorance and transference of self - loathing is woven together in a story that , , , , and and the concurrent disruption of world gone wrong into a pungent story of tragedy and collision . Every character in this well - script eventually every other character in ways that are at times coincidental , at times , tangential , and at other times the direct result of prior . bully each other over their own , belittle their and are the first to point the finger at the   who in reality are innocent , on their property immediately aim their hate at other minority , racist thrash out at in response to their own personal family that have eroded their outlook and extend that venom to the most innocent of the rookie who metamorphose into like . Every form of prejudice and hate is and none of the is free from being both the perpetrator and the victim . It is as though the Golden Rule of  Do unto as you would have do unto you  been hideously into a reason for violence . Each member of this extraordinary ensemble acting team is outstanding form those with the to those whose presence is fleetingly meaningful . And some of the heretofore know as B rise to the level of brilliance under Haggis  knowing direction . , , Don , ( here is a star !), Newton ,   , Tate , ( extraordinary !), , , ( who the most affecting scene in the film ), , Perry , Frasier , Bullock , Tony , - indeed , the list of the entire cast should be included in the kudos . People leave the theater , tearful , informed , and incredulous , so great is the impact of this film . Much or that impact is by the brilliantly creative cinematography of and and by the powerful musical score by Mark . This is quite simply one of the of the year by anyone  s . For those who descry Haggis  lack of providing  Redemption  for the , this viewer would take offense : every character is either tangentially , directly , or referentially by the tightly woven tapestry that is CRASH . for everyone to see , internalize , and begin to make on our planet .

"I don  t mean to sound ( I know I will though ) but this movie is definitely love it or hate it for most people . Most seem to be 1 / 10 or 10 / 10 and this is for a good reason . This is one of those that will definitely  speak  to some people and leave cold . Yes here comes another , I guess you either  get it  or not . I  m 21 and this movie spoke to me more clearly than most i  seen recently and it definitely been made for a certain generation and a certain way of thinking . Its hard to into a particular genre because it  t seem to fit anything well . It  s a sort of comedy love story about a 20 something guy who is feeling that sense of being lost and un - attached that most people go through in their . The way its made though is definitely for the 20 - of today , through the music , the and numerous . It definitely touched on the malaise i  felt as a university graduate who is currently feeling slightly lost and unsure about where to go in life . A lot of people seem to have this movie quite badly in their . All I can say is , not many make me cry or think as deeply as this one did . And thats recommendation enough for me . I it .",0
"Don  t be : you  re not going to go see a horror movie . You  re going to immerse yourself into a strange , morbid atmosphere that will carry you through an intimate , beautifully story where it  s the atmosphere and the that count . Yes , there  s a few horror , but they are a subtle , underlying subplot that does not interfere with the delicate , smooth direction of Walter . Nothing in this film is meant to scare you , but rather to leave a sense of discomfort after you  seen it . A sense of paranoia , like the main character  s . And is absolutely fantastic here . Much than the original : here , the are real , and connect us to their turmoil right away . Reminiscent of a Henry novel , where fear up in the background as you share more and more of the main character  s feeling . In a word : sophisticated . Different . The only similar experiment of this kind of subtle fear , in your imagination as you watch the film , is an short I saw at last year  s ,  . While you wait to be on screen , the story almost subliminally built horror in the audience  s mind . A must see .",1

"As much as I Burton  s first two film  s I think this new effort will leave just how good they actually are and will look at Batman as the best of all of them in the genre .

"This low budget horror flick pretty much flew straight under the radar upon release towards the end of 2004 , and while the film  t deserve the status of a classic , or even a modern genre classic ; Creep still a good , horrific eighty and of classically plotted horror will no doubt enjoy themselves . The film is very thin on plot , and works just from a premise - the premise being that found herself trapped in the subway after . This  t be so bad , but she  s got a strange mutant on her tail that to delight in murdering everyone around her ! While this plot  t really allow the audience to engage with it due to the fact that it is so shallow , director Smith the film ticking over with an onslaught of suspense and tension brought about by the landscape of the underneath and the fairly generous helping of disgusting gore effects , which are a nice addition to any horror movie if you ask me . If the film any sort of commentary on the state of the management of  s , it  s at best but it  t matter , as nobody this sort of thing for social anyway . The effects of the  creep  itself are actually quite good . The monster is enough to be visibly inhuman , but it enough of it  s human form to be humane in some way . The creature effects in this film seem to have been a big influence on fellow recent Brit horror  The Descent , as the in that film very much the one in this . a lot about running since her big hit was the highly German drama  Run Run , and she to stretch her in this film more than just a bit too . The frantic pace of the film really it what it is , and while there  s nothing in this film that you haven  t seen before ; the movie it  s and them together into a slick horror cocktail . The fact that it  s only on for eighty will ensure that you wont get in spite of it  s thin premise , and if a short running time  t good enough for you ; the gritty gore certainly will be , as this film lots of grappling , stabbing , and many other such . It would seem that the director an eye for too , as he a few of them - the best being the bloodied hand reaching up from under a train !",1

I love the in the movie . They were excellent at keeping me . After the first time I saw this movie , I just to keep watching because I love this movie so much .

"Saw  Wedding  today and thought it was hilarious . The audience was all of life . High school aged to elderly . Everyone hard and there was applause at the end of the movie . While it the  Frat Pack  is constantly in a new movie every couple , you can  t argue with the comedic . Anyone who Animal House , Bachelor Party , and will love this flick ! really a better comedic presence than in my opinion . This Frat Pack to be quite the fad for the last few . In an era of such political correctness , nice to see a flick that  t afraid to push the envelope with that most people think but are afraid to express publicly nowadays . movie I  seen so far in 2005 .

"When Terry decided to make this film he did so in order to tell the story of one man  s struggle to protect the of his family and of those taking refuge under the roof of the hotel he . The manager , ( Don ) awoke each new day to find an ever set of to follow and new to appease with . only about the taking place outside of the hotel through radio , , and UN . I don  t believe it was crass ( as it been stated on some ) to focus on the story of an individual who the massacre as opposed to the of nearly a million who were . I think the viewer the idea that a genocide is taking place , we feel it as the surrounding the hotel become and any semblance of protective help is being out of the country . In fact , one of the most heart place during an evacuation of all non - native people . On the bus to safety we can see every type of person on board who  t a . Even dogs are on the bus , just not any of the people . As the bus away from the hotel , the gravity of the situation is all very clear to those left behind . And as this is the story of the incredible survival of and those he was able to save from a certain death , his story becomes all the more remarkable . Terry to shine a light on a massacre that went largely unnoticed or by millions of people . He did so by the story of the movie onto one man  s struggle for survival . Perhaps by making this movie he may have also to make us more aware of our place in the world at large , so that we may better shape any upcoming of genocide to occur in the future . Or perhaps we  stay insulated in our own with of celebrity , comfort and where  the of today are tomorrow  s bargain . For those who have read the above header and think it to be crass , you would be correct , it is crass . However , that  t make the header any less true .

I  m sure the header I  thought up for this movie review will offend someone , but I can  t say that was my intention . It may be a cynical thought , but it to be true . What light it is seen in is entirely up to interpretation . I believe Terry had the best of , I don  t believe he made his movie to be crass . The important lesson to be learned is that of learning any lesson at all . Even after watching  Hotel  and being deeply affected by it , I wonder if I  be able to live outside of my own head . I hope we have learned , but I realize that there was a time when the world at large the other way while a million people were ; now they can click on a link and  Shop Hotel . 9 / 10 Clark",1
"Where do you start with this dog ? First of all it is pretty pleasing to the eye , with lots of action & spectacle . But that  s about it . This is History as through the lens of a movie . For a start never the of Troy , he outside . Also lived well beyond the battle well before the fall of Troy . There  s lots besides that , the usual rubbish of sword play . anyone EVER tried to stick even the sword into someone ? I was lucky that I never had to bayonet anyone , but I  spoken to people who have & they all told me that you just can  t go up to someone & go  HAH ! & have a blade go right through . Don  t forget you  got to add in the protection of & the fact that the ancient  t have been as sharp or tough as modern . We know from that the  t so stupid as to have their bounce off the enemy , they went for the , preferably the , to drop your opponent where you could cut his throat or just let them bleed to death . The fight shown in  Troy  are , as a result , totally fatuous . There  s lots of sneering , grunting , dialogue & even worse acting . This to be the for Brad , I  never seen him so one dimensional , it is as if he  t want to be there at all . Cox goes a long way to the on screen with his & Bean does what he can with the role of ( a role so truncated as to be almost erased from the story altogether ) but the supporting cast of various just get by as if going by - the - . Peter O  a watchable , but his age to get the better of him , his sonorous repetition of  The  this &  The  that seldom allow him to rise above the mediocre . However that is something of an achievement give the standard of the rest of the cast . as is eye candy , end of story . Bloom promise as , but the part seldom him to develop . However I do like the fact that he barely disguised fear when entering into battle , which is probably something closer to the truth than the tales handed down by the who these at the time . Of course the big sticking point with anything dealing with history is the touchy subject of homosexuality . The such a high value on female virginity that recreational sex had to find an outlet somewhere & man - on - man action was the only alternative , assuming you had no captive to be your sex . The latter is clearly , but not shown , the former  t even appear by inference , but are clear that this was a normal & every day affair . However , as we have already seen , little respect for the truth or accuracy ( which is why such awful tripe as U517 got made ). Finally the is often obvious & , especially when the large formation so or are shown . I  seen better in Role computer . This is definitely not up to the superb standard of in The Lord of the . But then if it was smooth & natural it would seem out of place amongst the script & the acting . Chug lots of beer & settle down with a pizza if you want to make this an enjoyable experience . If you  any previous knowledge of history then avoid this or you  throw up , no matter how much beer you  had .",0
"The Life Aquatic with   s smeared all over it -- from the eclectic unable to express themselves totally , to the musical designed to stand in for , to the red and turquoise the wear . It is also a lot more laid back , which might explain why I it more than his previous works -- unlike   or  The Royal ,  The Life Aquatic   t so enamored of its own preciousness that it becomes a hindrance on the film ( too often hell - bent on modern cinema back to the innocence and of the 1930s ), and instead more raucously , succeeding in spite of its and ridiculous ( , anyone ?). The plot around ( an inspired Bill ), a washed - up oceanographer and his band of documentary , who set out on the trail of the infamous Jaguar Shark that  s partner ; also along for the ride is a pregnant reporter ( Cate ) and a man who could be  s son ( ).

"Garden State  is one of those that you see on a whim , and immediately recognize as something meant exactly for you . As a twenty - something disaffected youth ,  s bittersweet portrayal of a for a character spoke to me probably more than it might someone older . I was genuinely how good this movie was . But why is it a  failure , you ask ? It  s not that the film to convey its message of acceptance and angst . It  s just that I  m not sure the message was the right one . home to attend the funeral of his mother , whose paralysis he reportedly while still a young child . Feared as a danger by his father , he been on various since he was ten old . Now back in town after a brief glimpse of his unsuccessful life in LA as a struggling actor , himself in the midst of old whose have turned out even worse , and a new one whose life with his own . The movie works in spite of some very  film student  ( such as the final scene between and his father , a very Holm ) because you start to care for as his fog is and he finally a real life . The romance with Sam ( Portman ) is never predictable . You knew it was coming if you saw the poster for the movie , but you don  t know the way in which they react to one another . A previous commentator how Portman finally to show off the charm that she possessed in , and I concur . You can  t tell me you  t fall in love with a girl like Sam if you just randomly met her . The failure is in the message of the film , which either to be against the funk that most of the find themselves in , or casually it . I  t really tell which version was trying to convey . There  s a sense that he  s being honest to what most twenty - do when trapped in a small - town existence . I know myself people like the in the film , people whose revolve around the next party or the next opportunity to get high . In a small town , are pretty much a crutch which you from trying for a real life , . to convey that disconnect from reality most effectively in a montage of - up . I think most of the stumble around in a chemical fog much like  s , a point that I the first time around . It  t hurt that he an interest in the very lovely Portman . Overall , the film many , but it works on charm enough to make it a repeat staple for youth . I think does go a little overboard in the he to incorporate , but he to make a good film despite it . And the is a masterpiece in and of itself . I don  t know that this will attain  The Graduate  status , but it certainly a good start as a cult flick worth long into the night .",0
"When I went to see this movie , I had high because I saw the other two Lord of the and thought they were both amazing . But when I saw this movie I was in awe . This film went way beyond my . There  t enough in the language that could describe how good this movie is . It  s just incredible !! This also the first time that I have ever cried in a movie theater . And I am not a person who usually during a movie . Out of the three Lord of the , this one is the best by far . It is currently sitting at # 4 on the top 250 here at . However , I think this movie should be # 1 by a few . It is just so good . I can  t understand how any other movie could be better . This is definitely a movie that everybody on Earth should see at some point in their lifetime . Yeah it  s that good !! 10 / 10",1
"seen the Movie Version of , West Side Story and countless other I must say I was not anything overly special when it came to this film , to me most are really rather boring and only enjoyable to watch when nothing else is on . Well This film my opinion , all I can say is WOW . The Music Score was excellent , the Acting was brilliant and I was from start to finish . So much so that I never that it went on for as long as it did . The Only I can come up with are really very minor , and that is the guy who the Phantom at times did not have a voice that was powerful enough to do justice to the music score , otherwise no . I have to admit that what me to this film was watching a video of the song  Phantom of the Opera  by one of my , the video made the film look good . The thing is the Film is so much better than the Video as to lift the Video up , not the other way around ( as is normal ). As I rented it , tomorrow ( or later today should I say ) I am gong to go and buy it . Awesome .",0
"I have just watched 2001 , eagerly I might say , as so many seem to think its great . I was genuinely , no .. I was actually mortified . It  s so bad I cannot believe it was even made . The sheer mind numbing boredom made it difficult to sit through let alone understand , which is , of course not hard , as there is no decent plot whatsoever . It is truly awful and although I do agree with one guy that it is visually capable that is no reason to list it anywhere near the top of any list of . Please save us from this sort of crap . it only it worse for the movie industry , as some will want to make more like it . Just  cos made some  t mean they all are .

"In the age of kidnap and rendition , this movie could easily be a more indirect question about blind revenge and skewed . People being people will always attempt to divert blame for their past on to handy . It  s human nature to be spineless and cowardly . And the more wealth and power you have , the more spineless and cowardly you can afford to be . I get the feeling that this movie been getting such a panning on these because it a lot of the ( predominantly male ) hypersensitive homespun a wee bit uncomfortable . In a world of and an explosive growth in child abuse in so , it  s a brave film maker who is prepared to jab a red hot needle into the psychotic nerve of the beast daddy . It  s a film about base human nature with all its banal idiotic , feeble and self deceit . Which is a fair premise to work with . A film is just some jabbering at a camera on some . The and are in the of the cinema - going or beholder . Is it disgusting ? Or maybe the of apoplectic are just disgusted at their own to these particular ? It  s a film . It  s a work of fiction .

"For a movie to be cinematically successful , it must generate in the viewer . This documentary is laden with drama but short in one critical area - the . It took about 20 for me to figure this out . All of this wonderful scenery with a story of heroic and a cast of - and maudlin music . Leaving the theater , I  t help thinking how better it would have been with a score by or even Horner ( who could have gone back to for more material ). A lost opportunity in my opinion .

H is a decent . Only poor is as .. although thankfully she is given practical wardrobe rather than the usual tat action wear . The action are diverting , the score is memorable but the main thing about this production is the wonderfully evocative cinematography .

"never read any of the , and indeed never being a comic fan , i must confess I really this film . Simply reading the cast list , reading the ( i live in it only came out in mid ) and eventually seeing the I I would like the film , but probably not to the extent i did . From start to finish , the way the film is shot , a black and white film with certain part is very effective . The cast all shine in their individual . All star cast often seem to fall flat but this is one example where it  s really come off well . They  be to find a cast as good as this for Sin City 2 . Certainly a highlight for many is seeing Wood in a role so completely different from of Lord of the . As you would expect from anything that does , and any that anything to do with , it  s a very violent film . Due to the black and white , some that are extremely violent or gory are made watchable . I this . It  s not so bad that people will be really turned off by it ( people who watch of this genre that is ) and yet it  s still extremely cool action . One thing that really me was the . There was no basically the entire film . This is so hard to find now day . It if you want to make a kick ass film with lots of action and violence people won  t appreciate it unless it  s full of the  f  word . That really me and is probably my biggest criticism of who  s work I still really like . So this was very refreshing . Overall , it  s a fantastic film , I  seen in twice in a week and i  m sure i  d still enjoy it if I saw it again . If you know anything of the director , you  expect there  be lots of violence and lots of parading around in little clothing . If you don  t want to see that , then don  t watch this film . Simple . Don  t watch it then come about all that stuff . For most of us who have enough interest to come to this page , I  m confident this film will exceed your .",1

Seeing this movie , I thought a lot about the massacre here in China during the World War 2nd , the army about more 300 , 000 people , but we haven  t made a single big movie to reveal that history . there are lots of talking about the killing , and there is a Hotel telling the world what in , but why don  t we make a movie showing the world what the done to us back in the 1930s in ? About Jean in the movie , he a bit rigid in acting , I think he should be more passionate . The art direction is good . Terry did a great job . The screenplay is good too . the music is , Jean sung the song well . anyways , I am going to show my family this movie .",1
"Dark Water may not be the new Rosemary  s Baby - it  s not quite subtle enough for that - but it itself a solid suspense - film nonetheless . In a time when movie - seem more intent on shaking us up than actually us in a story , this film comes as something of a revelation - a horror movie where the tension gradually , where human interest precedence over cheap shock - effects . The recent horror - excursion Saw cheesy and amateurish by comparison to Dark Water with its brooding intensity , its emotional texture . A movie like Saw is all about to the of morbid , the kind of people who still think is cool . A movie like Dark Water a somewhat more sophisticated , though still readily accessible , brand of . Like Rosemary  s Baby the film is all about a threatening environment . , who recently from her husband , with her young daughter into a rent - housing complex on Island , ., a run - down tenement with a sleazy landlord , a grouchy super and a few dark . and are barely settled - in before they start of a - movie - setting : strange from the room upstairs , bad , a nasty water - stain spreading through the ceiling - all that can be rationally - for , of course , except that something more sinister than noisy or bad plumbing . The problem is that herself is not exactly the picture of mental stability . She lots of left over from her rotten childhood ; she  s unsettled after the separation from her husband ; she - in short , the apparent supernatural could all be in her head . Like Rosemary  s Baby the film us with the possibility that the heroine is simply delusional , that the strange - on are part of some paranoid fantasy . The difference is in the subtlety of the effect . In Rosemary , an atmosphere through purely cinematic ; in Dark Water , director Walter more explicit imagery in helping generate a feeling of fear . Dark Water is less - accomplished than Rosemary cinematically , is more conventional in its effect , but it  s still a worthy successor to  s classic . It  s genuinely , and like Rosemary it around a brilliant , complex performance . That performance is turned - in by , one of the most riveting on the planet . Like in The Ring , acting and sex appeal , and an uncanny ability to pull one into the story . The mystery - plot of The Ring entirely upon  s ability to sell it , and the suspense - plot of Dark Water equally upon  s . This is a juicy part for any actress , a woman to protect her child from some unknown threat , and just it dead . Her dark hair and fit perfectly with the film  s brooding aesthetic , but what she in pure emotional focus is even more valuable . What is an almost freakish talent for psychic turmoil , the sense of a character being eaten alive by inner - . She this ability first in Requiem for a Dream , then in House of Sand and Fog as a lonely , outcast , and in Dark Water she herself . Her is a horror - movie heroine for all - times , right up there with Farrow  s Rosemary - a character so fully - , so memorable that it its . The best of Dark Water are those when suspense - mechanics and horror - imagery become irrelevant , and what we  re left with is the story of a woman  s psychological disintegration . If the film overall to quite rise to its star  s level , it  s only because the plotting is a little too routine and the tone at times too insistent . It could  stood to be a little more subtle , and take better advantage of , but even as it is , Dark Water is a superior suspense exercise .",1
"The action photography was horrible ! If you like watching the camera bounce all over the screen during the action then you  love this movie . When are the going to stop over the camera to their 8 year old  s to shoot the action . It  s like they do not want us to actually see whats going on during these . It me dizzy to try and watch them . I don  t know if it was just me , but I could not make out a lot of what was saying either . Another thing , call me old fashioned , but I like it when the guy the girl . I really don  t think she could have her own in a fist fight against .",1
"Marvelous . Outstanding . The only thing I can find wrong is the film  s title ... MILLION DOLLAR BABY . This is a drama that a punch .

Their take on a new perspective when a thirty - something waitress ( Swank ) comes to the gym to find a manager and trainer to help her escape poverty by becoming a boxer . and are convincing enough to change  s mind about training a woman for the ring . to have the determination and the punch to become an fighter .

"I want more blood . I want more being chopped off . I want more , more , more dead , more people being eaten alive . I want it all in beautiful monochrome . In fact , next time , can I have a group of innocent people being in the style of a painting , set to ... I don  t know  s . ? Why ? Is that your own hypocrisy slapping you round your face ? Well , we  come a long way haven  t we ? We are pass the point where violence is merely accepted in society and art , now we actively relish in it . This is a film that as much respect for the human body and soul as Abu prison . And this is our  fun . This is what we do to chill out and kick back with some . watch a massacre . watch suicide and decapitation . make a cup of tea and watch blood spurt out of a neck . I  m a 23 year old liberal , but like this and Kill Bill make me think that moaning old might have a point , and I HATE them for that . Oh but Dan , you can  t seriously believe that like this make people more violent . Who if they provoke more violence ?  t it just a bit disturbing that people are getting off to this junk in the first place ??! I  t want any of mine to enjoy watching someone getting eaten alive for entertainment . Stop paying for this life - insulting junk .",1
"I came into this movie a similar movie to Old School but I was disappointed with the outcome . First off , the movie off like a preview because the story was poorly in the opening scene ( not to mention that the whole plot was wrapped up in the first ten meaning the plot was very weak ) and immediately the audience was to the two main a wedding . From there , the movie was nonstop action of and drinking and eating cake . I  t understand it and it felt like my head was going round and round . I kept thinking when this chaos was going to end even though the first scene basically wrapped up the general plot , excluding the romance between the two main . My second problem with the movie was how inconsistent the humor was . I have a problem with most of a movie being funny , and ridiculously silly and then suddenly , there is a transition to a serious moment and the audience is wondering where the hell humor went , or are we supposed to be laughing at this ? The serious were corny , especially the the as a verbal abuser and a typical prick . I just got sick of the sentimental following a ridiculous moment such as  s moment with the gay brother or the whole part with Will . My last problem with the movie was  s character . The character was one of the least innovative because every one of his was predictable . He just  t add anything to the movie except a stupid excuse for to fall in love with . It had many funny , but I wish the movie had used less serious , romantic and just had stuck with the humor .",1
"I am not a big fan of , even though I have seen all the Romero , my friend is big into them , so went with him to see this latest installment , this was supposed to be a sequel or continuation of the made in the late early , I thought this might be somewhat interesting then . The biggest thing that got me if this was a continuation of those why were the very 21  st century technology ? They seem to have access to , and current computer technology , also if I remember right belly  t any kind of fad in the late 70  s , and I would seriously doubt that technology would evolve after the Earth no or going , I to see a world frozen in the late 70  s , not running around high end tech , both me and my friend said that at the same time when leaving the .",1
"If there is one word which the entire message of this film , it is HOPE . Though I have never been a King fan , this is one story which him deserve over and over again . When I was watching the movie , halfway through it , I admit I was . And when Tommy ( Bellows ) was shot , I was like  Who the hell me this movie ??. But still I just to get this movie over with , so I watched further . And when that scene comes where the warden a pebble at the poster and it right through !!! My God !!! My mouth was agape the whole time !!! What a fantastic ending !. The movie indeed the best finale in cinematic history .( The Usual comes a close second ..). were superb .. (.. I still think deserved a nomination more than Morgan Freeman ..). The were damn good as the . But overall , I believe the story itself a special place in the annals of great cinema !!!",1
"I a lot of people say this movie is comparable to Seven . Are you ??? This silly little thriller nothing to do with  s masterpiece . For several . First , Seven is able to catch the audience attention and to thrill them without needing to use some childish trick like a masked villain coming suddenly out of darkness ! Second , Seven on a deep psychological analysis on the main . Saw  t even try to do so ( not bad for an  psychological thriller  !!!) Third there  s an enormous difference in the quality of the  between the two ! We have Brad , Morgan Freeman , end versus Glover and the guy from  Robin Hood : Man in Tights  !!! Fourth the quality of direction , photography and cutting  t even comparable . Fifth , Seven is completely believable , while Saw is full of nearly ridiculous logically impossible , and many in the plot just don  t work ! ( e . g .: a doctor not realizing the man lying next to him is not dead , the detective who the run away once he got him , the X on the wall not seen by the two at the beginning , when the are off , and many other ) Just to mention the most evident . I rented this movie because everybody said to me it was like Seven . And I am so mad at throwing away my money this way !!",1
"I  seen the movie and it is a really good movie . It is well written . The are really good . Bulter ( The Phantom ) really put a lot of feeling in his part by speaking and singing . The part of the movie I was  The Point of No Return  Bulter ( The Phantom ) and ( ) put a lot of passion and feeling into the song . I really the movie , it is seductive and beautiful . The music is really good and well . I read the novel by and the novel is really good . It is different from the movie , but is well written . Webber did a wonderful job of the book on stage and film .",0
"Perry his Murphy with the character Joe ( who really  t particularly necessary ), and although  Big  at time , overall she  s compassionate and real . She  s meant as comic relief , but at times is written as serious . She  s better that way . Her strong - will is a key to the movie . is a good actress and is decent in this movie . The opening scene and her relationship with her husband so over - the - top . But my mouth admittedly when his clear - cut infidel family actually is extended beyond the woman . It  s one thing to cheat , quite another to literally have a second family . My if that juice from you . We knew how the movie would end from the , not to mention the evident to  s character were so heavily the acting was downright horrible . But is more that applicable for this movie . Those chiding him as purely a Soap actor are not unfair ; however , he is convincing . I believe his pursuit is in earnest and the knowing struggle of  s character .  s character is pathetic at times and us a trite statement to sum it up ; however , it is central to the movie . You do find yourself saying to the screen  What are you doing ? It  s clear she needs closure and in a she - devil type of way she to receive it . Irony is ever - present in this movie , but best when is making herself more miserable when exacting her revenge . It  s like these that sensible advice that rather natural . Perry does have himself in the flesh in this movie and is a fleshy , decent character . I feel for him , but he certainly is overly tight when trying to eliminate of struggle and the ending concerning him is too tidy , whilst is over dramatic , and is unquenched . But I like it at the same time because sometimes when calm and at peace , sense . It here . and Perry , combined with and at times do the movie justice , while it was a good casting call to get  Star Search  star Tiffany as Perry  s daughter . is so callous it  t seem real sometimes ; moreover , it is certainly pointed in favor of . It  t take that much extraneous writing to figure that out or get us to feel that way . But slowly it is revealed how poor this relationship really was . on here , but mostly grit to the movie . Perry to give and never subtly them , yet the movie is decent , a bit mushy , and a touch long . It is a five - minute story that most develop as it does : over time .",1
"Too bad that such an extraordinary director  t want to spend more time such an extraordinary story . The complex , tragic , pathetic , infantile , almost  - esquire  life of Timothy ( the  Grizzly Man ) deserved much more commitment . himself admitted in a recent post - screening discussion that , in order to show it at , he made the documentary in very few days without even the time to watch all the 100 + of  s original footage .  t even bother to  s bear obsession . He  t interview any prominent scientist and therefore we have no idea how valuable or his in bear country really were . Poor execution also on the personal front of the story : , his , who was afraid of and never the less him to his deadly Neverland and with him , less exposure than his pet . Then there are the debatable of wearing and listening in camera to the of the last horrific of and  s and the uneven of for the . Even with all these , the documentary to be seen because of  s absolutely fascinating candid footage . The pervasive feeling of impending doom a la  Blair Witch Project  also to make this documentary watchable . Just wait for the release on Discovery .",1
"I was worried I would not like the performance of the character of the Phantom , being by Butler . He was magnificent . Incredible actor , great voice , than any man I have ever seen on screen . Made me wish I was 20 younger , and he was just around the corner . Very believable as the Phantom . 5 star performance . All of the other were divine . I came away thinking , I could not wait to buy the . I have 5 , for different and family . I recently Dear , and was amazed again at Butler  s performance . I cannot wait until his new flick comes out ,  . What a delight to know Butler will be making more that we all can enjoy .",0
"I saw this film over two ago and it  s still going through my mind . The main character is the I live in - most of us isolated in our as we travel though our daily on congested and streets , slowly towards our . Only when forced by the usual violent do we rub up against our varied ethnic only to realize how different we all are - and yet , as this film , how similar our humanity is . Crash is a great ensemble film , drawing together that give both subtle and dramatic life to their . Bullock for once a dramatic edge to her acting ability , and Don as always , his talent a hundred percent . The rest of the cast out in their ability to give this film not only the different between the , but also the thin gray that blur . Haggis us how fear us isolated , and yet how once in a while when it is for our humanity us together to show how much we all share in common . This film is out by outstanding camera work and a that greatly to the revealed in it . Although I have mixed about any movie ( everybody their own different when it comes to watching a film ) this is one film I feel to talking about to . When award time comes around I feel this one should be on the list for consideration .",0
"it was an film i suppose but after reading a lot of good i was looking forward to an early blockbuster hit . i was wrong . admittedly the special effects were quite impressive for a release and the acting from was very good . on the other hand was awful . does he just act off of a ? it may as well be like he  s reading a book or off a piece of paper . he is a diabolical actor and  t deserve the high standard of actor . he is worse than his in the film . ( real name ) was quite good as a . he was a good entertaining character . but was dull and dreary . very . I  seen in a few other such as I , Robot ( bit part ) and . ( i think that was him ). and he really potential in I , Robot to be the next smooth talking actor on the big screen . like Colin cos he like he is confident and he is realistic with the way he . this boy a great deal of potential and talent . he go far . but the film is entertaining in like the computer effects and the bath scene but everything else went out the window . literally . there was many plot . very much disappointing but it is worth the watch if ur into the tales of hell and the devil . 6 out of ten for the graphics",1
"On the  shot - by - shot - remake - o - meter , on which the   is a 10 , I  d rate this about a 7 . 5 , somewhere around  Point of No Return / La . I thought Billy Bob was well - cast , and all the did great . But in this classic , I think the an opportunity , especially considering that original screenwriter Bill got to pen this version . The charm of the original movie , for me , was the unvarnished realism with which it childhood . I was about the age of the original , and scene after scene rang true -- especially the fight at the hot dog stand . Even with the dramatic that distinguish every film from real life , that movie really what it felt like to be a grade school in 1976 . The remake also does a good job ... of what it  s like to be a 1976 grade - school . I  got that age who play ball , and their are different from my own childhood in countless ways . But the new movie for superficial : Kelly over a maneuver , not air hockey . The bookish a instead of a scorebook . One of the is , and another is disabled , so the  motley bunch  construct is a little more courant . Swell . But Tanner still his 1976 hair , and the presence of two - speaking in southern is still as a notable occurrence . More importantly , all the are the same . If they had really cracked this one open and reworked it on a level , they could have come up with new that would resonate for with the of today , like the original did for me . I don  t know if today  s will see themselves in this movie . The most substantive update -- Gay Harden as the adult Whitewood character , instead of a man -- to a subplot that the almost exclusively , and is completely abandoned . The remake is watered down in ways that are not surprising , in of Tanner  s invective and Bullock  s treatment of his son on the mound . But the power of those original  t by anything ; it  s just missing . Finally , a little generational boosterism . was a as the original Kelly Leak . I don  t have the blanket disdain for that I  m seeing elsewhere on , and I did find this film to be entertaining and enjoyable . But it could have been so much more than it was . Perhaps the best thing about its release is that it of the original on cable .",0
"I think I  m going to go shopping for a file cabinet this weekend . I  been meaning to get my life more organized , and I figured it  d be a good idea to start filing . I  pick up several as well , and I  be sure to label one  Unnecessary of my Time . Under  U  of course . And while I  m at it , I think I  go ahead and make  Remake of The Bad News  the first entry I file . I actually to be fairly by this movie , so I was quite by how pedestrian it is . Billy Bob as an alcoholic Little League baseball coach ? Come on , that  s be pretty funny , right ? Well , you  d think . But strangely enough , is quite subdued , and apparently the thought it  d be absolutely hilarious if they made the than . Perhaps the could use a course on how to more effectively think through . I never dismiss a movie immediately just because it  s a remake . I always give it a chance to stand on its own . Unfortunately , this is a remake that content with touching all the main plot from the original , and then just making the cuss more . Sorry , but I fail to see the humor in 11 year running around saying God - d ** n and the like . , yeah , there  s some crisp screen writing there . If I see an 11 or 12 year old that kind of language in real life I can  t help but think it  s a punk who  t been taken to the woodshed enough . I certainly don  t cheer them on . Same thing with the in this movie . I  m all for a good underdog story , but this is one of the least inspiring underdog I  ever seen . I was actually against the . Talk about the biggest collection of annoying I  seen in a long time , especially Tanner ( ). It  s bad enough that his stupid girly hair him look like a young , but his taste for the profane and penchant for getting into indicate to me that he  s just going to be another drain on taxpayer money when he  s sitting in a jail cell in a few . He  s a prime example of why you  t spare the rod . The movie also way too hard to attempt to be controversial without being all that offensive . For example , the are by Bo strip club . This  t offend me so much as it my intellect due to the fact that it  s just not very funny .  , look at how irreverent we are ! This is edgy stuff ! We have now thusly taken the to dine at ! Bow at our over - the - top vulgarity ! Um , I  m not too .  Well you should be ! Fine , we will henceforth throw in another instance of a child a curse word ! That shall surely induce of laughter ! Not really . Oh , well , then we shall have Billy Bob say such taboo as ,  This is not a democracy ! It  s a dictatorship , and I  m ! Woo , yeah , that  s really crossing the line there . Nice try . Maybe if you have a sequel you can replace   with   or   and REALLY cross the line . Good job , , you  got some ready - made just sitting in the queue . Give me a break . Billy Bob does have his , and he  s obviously the thing the movie going for it , but at times the movie like an awkward attempt at him just monologue in an effort to come up with a memorable one - liner . After each attempt he  s to keep going , as if we  re being to a rehearsal scene or something .  The audience  t laugh ? , let  s try another ... Oh , and let me get back to the for a second - for the most part they  re all really bad . Especially Kraft and Jeff . I know they  t have previous acting experience , but , it sticks out like at a virgin convention . I to feel embarrassed watching . Kraft trying to spit out a simple line like ,  You . are . a . lazy . drunk . My sister thought she the girl and me ,  Where else have I seen her ? I with ,  Not acting school . And poor Jeff - sure , he can hit a baseball , but he like going through an awkward stage of puberty , and his line delivery is just as unemotional as . Kraft  s . I just  t buy him as the bad boy that so well in the original . It  s not often that I  m actually by truly bad acting in a big screen release , so , Bad News ! You  got that going for you ! After about 35 , when I this just  t going to be a very funny movie , I decided to start counting how many times we were to laugh at fly , booted , turd , and the insulting each other and getting into . After I had exhausted all 10 within the course of about 5 I decided to just give up , lean back in my seat , and ride it out . T   t easy , especially since this inexplicably almost two , but I . Whenever Billy Bob who the will be next he them what that for the opposing team . The yell out ,  Bad news ! How that the same mantra can be applied to what you can expect if you fork out your hard - dough to see this on the big screen .",0

"First of all , I would like to tell you that I haven  t had this much fun in the movie theater in a long time . There are a lot of subtle in this film and you  re permanently laughing . The are very well to the and I think they actually took advantage of a very simple plot and turned it to very subtle and clever , that  s what all the movie is about . Of course that if you are a serious person and you  re looking for a long , thought over plot you have to go and see some other movie , but for me , it did the purpose and it actually me . I went with no to the movie theater ( because I  seen , The and Monster  s ), but the movie did not disappoint me at all and surprisingly , was a lot of fun .

"This is the beautiful story of a group of living in Antarctica that make several long to get to their breeding ground . It these as they give birth to and then bring them up .

It is really touching to see these walking 70 - 80 for the sake of their , bearing extreme . The whole family will find this entertaining , but young may be disturbed by the of dead and eating .

"Some people speak of how this movie  s relationship with , and how many people dislike the focus on a homosexual relationship in the movie . Commonly , these include an assessment that the in  s day were far different from the of our day . This is true . The homosexual relationship that between and , however , would not have been the same as a homosexual relationship today . This is one of the movie  s great . and are in a manner more befitting on Will and Grace than as the that they were . Apparently , for Stone , if someone sex with a man that person will act like a girl . The movie also in a commander that could actually inspire . in front of his men . He them instead of commanding them . There is nothing in the character in the movie that would cause a man to follow him for on end . The man who would cut the knot is nowhere to be found in this movie . I guess it  s fortunate that that story  t in the movie . The movie also in an area that could have made it at least mildly entertaining . The huge battle utilize a  shaky camera  method to make seem violent and exciting . The result is that it is next to impossible to make out what exactly is going on in the . They also serve to further display  s apparent impotence . No brilliant tactical are shown . also the ability to actually hit an opponent with a thrown weapon . At the end of the movie , on  s greatness . I  t find anything great about . This is quite perturbing for me . the Great is my favorite historical figure . I was to find out that a movie about his life was being made . Imagine my disappointment to find nothing of that person in the movie . Oh . Wait . Yeah . He had sex with men . When that the most important part of his story ... I don  t know .",1
"I have to confess . I laughing at some point in the film . Not at Amy  s delicately dark portrayal of a woman trapped in God - - what misery . This odd concoction kept my interest , but , God help me , kept getting and . I was never in these so the suspense  t kill me when they were in jeopardy . I was laughing and saying ,  Take them all away to the loony bin ! They  re all ! Everything was laden with psychiatric , like the whole cast was from the Day Room at Psych 2 !  s wardrobe , on all three separate she , was so low - cut I  m De  t offer to treat her for a breast fetish . The and was silent . There were so many dead where she  t answer or that you wish people would just quit talking to her ! Everybody was pussyfooting around treating her so gently , that I hoped somebody would scream ,  STOP IT , ! SNAP OUT OF IT ! It  t until the end that we realize WHY she up , poor devil , with her hyper - fervid out of her head and her penchant for morbid of herself and her invisible maniac friend  . You  enjoy this movie if you like to see a get into bed a dozen times with identical pillow talk from three different who must have been raised in the same Group Nuthatch . You  like it if you play hide - and - seek and hear De incessantly calling ,  ? ? Em ? with squeaking and . It  s a long , languid fright in the night , especially at 2 : 06 a . m .. I don  t see how the De Clan could go to the bathroom in that house . Nights , the bathroom door is in light and , human and non , keep in his tub . If you enjoy seeing a look of consternation embed itself on De  s face , this film is your baby . ( Maybe he is just .) He he  s going to be a full - time Dad to his near - catatonic daughter and what does he do ? He her to a strange new manse in the country , where she around like a wraith while he a headset on his and jazz so loudly he can  t hear the or people knocking and walking in ! He fooling with a TELESCOPE , a very good one , brought from the city where , what ?, he used it to track his voyeur ? In the , he it to observe his sorrowing . De , supposedly , is a psychologist , counselor to all manner of folk for many , given his age ! Have a cathartic laugh . The of psychiatric personnel are with their own psychoses and blind in this movie . That is one reason I it - seeing the Behavior Police overwhelm and suffer ! There is a  good  psychologist / colleague of De  s , , who is so sweet , she should be . She  s evidently been working cheek - by - jowl with De for and NEVER picked up anything at all strange about him . But she lots of neuroses in the spooky child , who is so eerie with those the janitor could diagnose trouble . This movie is a psychiatric hoot . The neighbor lady , , is a real doll and the movie  s only normal human being , and is handling the recent death of her little girl with grace . Her husband , said to be goofy with grief , to be just fine . To these people , De no warmth except when he to advance his in this wooded Community from Hell and goes next door to fraternize , briefly . The canny neighbor woman WISELY his attempt to give them counsel . He  d certainly have brought them CLOSURE ! . Her , unlike the saintly lady shrink  s and  Decollete   s , are true ! I have never seen glass and a window frame break so quickly , and catapult a woman effortlessly a window in the little girl  s bedroom , with Bug - looking on .  Em ? ? ? Em  Em ? Soggy cat , crimson bath , bloody printed worthy of a demented kindergartner on the tub surround , swinging metal that squeak in the night , light on in basement a la  , with empty cot at the ready - a perfect sublet - this movie something for everyone . But , above all , it tickled my funny bone ! I the end , where the Arch - Villain , in that special inflatable yellow jacket , in the dingy , dank , dark drink of a convenient nearby cavern . The defunct Villain was kept afloat , amid a sea of baby , so a great profile could be shot . The last scene of the movie future psychiatric for the Saintly Lady Colleague to handle . It  t look good . But we somehow know that if this . is by the  Evil Eye  progeny she chosen to mother , she WILL go to Psychiatric Heaven with , , De ( he  t responsible for his , after all ) and . . At long last , in  Hide and Seek , the and are outed ! This is one cathartic anti - Diagnostic & Statistical Manual movie . How about a sequel that lovely neighbor lady writing a self - help book ,  Baked Goods Are Better Than Half - Baked ?",1

This movie ended up entertaining me way more than I should be willing to admit . It does get pretty silly and goofy , and at times the start to gag on their own cuteness . After all , we  re to laugh at the fact that absolutely excited over and microwave popcorn because hey , she  s a witch , and to a witch this kind of stuff is cool ! And I suppose we  re to howl in laughter every time an actress for the role of by her nose really badly . The stone cold silence that I to these probably  t what . was shooting for . But every now and then the goofiness is charming enough to work - that is if you  re willing to laugh at such as Will singing a cheesy song he wrote for , complete with him mouthing the guitar solo . I know is on a massive remake trend right now , but this is just clever enough to make it feel slightly different , slightly original . But it  s and , rather than the screenplay , that really raise the factor . herself from the horrid The , showing that she can handle comedy , and Will is , well , Will . That basically that he can be both annoying and funny at the same time , and he  s at his best when it like he  s being to ad - , and when he  s really huge of arrogance into his character , demanding ,  Make me 20 and bring me the best one . It  s nothing really worth the oxygen to try to convince you that it  s a definite must - see at the theater , nor did it excite me enough to reel off more than four for this review , but it  s a light , silly little comedy that quite a few and a handful of laugh - out - loud . I  d say trust your instinct on this one . If you  re dying to see it then catch a , if you  re on the fence then save it for a rental , and if you have no desire to see it then just skip it . I don  t care . I  t making any money off it .",0
"I have never been able to not finish a movie ... until this one . It was horribly dreadful . The only good thing was that I  t see it in the theater and waste $ 30 on movie and another $ 20 + on and such . Some great on the film but not near the comic you expect from someone like alum Bill . Plot was insufferable . Could only stand to watch for 30 . Then  t take it any more . Even the  t finish watching it . me not want to bother with Lost in Translation now . me think twice before going to the theater as well . I would have been horribly disappointed to spend all that dough to just walk out of the theater .",1
"Set in 15 ago , Oh himself a captive in a hotel room that as a prison cell without knowing who his captor is or why he been . The movie Oh  s emergence from his cell to find both himself and his captor of 15 . In short , old boy is a captivating revenge movie that as a great , refreshing movie - going experience . While it is a film ( i . e . Fight Club , Saw , that HATE or LOVE ), I guarantee most of you will like it . I came out of this one thinking , Man , I  never seen anything like this ! While it may be heavily derivative of something else I don  t know of , it and highly original and well - . There are some gory , but nothing I would consider gratuitous within the context of a revenge thriller . Despite its considerable violence , it  s not mindless and it  s not cheap : the story is fantastic but the and their are not unbelievable . The movie admirably to enter the psyche of each of the pivotal , one memorable scene with a large insect . This a great leap for / world cinema , and the world would be a better place for brave cinema as this ( not necessarily as violent , though ). I felt to write this after reading the worst review of a movie I  read in my life . The fact that they are it ( as opposed to another remake of a 70  s ) prove that people enjoy and appreciate this story .",0

Rock ( the best of the main ), - Smith ( who hardly any input ), Ben Stiller & ( primarily a one joke character ) all struggle with . ( Baron - . G ) & ( the Entertainer - Not a character name !!) are very enjoyable , but it is the who , without a doubt steal the movie . The ( all too ) brief to the are an adrenaline shot in the arm of a flagging movie . This film is only slightly better than the truly awful Tale , and both despite some fantastic set , in - , visual & snappy , suffer from a lack of emotional investment as we the audience never truly care for the , like we did of Woody , Buzz , , Marlin & the . If Animation are really serious about being an equal contender in the 3D (& to a lesser extent 2D ) animation market they have got to start spending a lot more time on writing & both the story & especially the , before throwing (& waisting ) wonderful talent & fantastic & occasionally clever at these rather lazy , paper - thin . I have no doubt that the younger will be kept amused and the older should enjoy the odd moment , but your better off waiting for the . Long Live !",0
"It is curious how some here deride those who did not like Lost in Translation , practically insulting them . Lost In Translation is not a movie for everyone , especially those with a decent knowledge of modern Japan . Nor is it a subtle masterpiece that only emotionless are unable to enjoy . Western cinema must be in a sorry state indeed if an average film like LiT is lit up as the movie of a year because it take two away from standard like the age - old love story or a clearly defined main character . Those two are not enough , they won  t take a movie anywhere . should be given some credit on a solid movie and an actor like , but the film itself is too void of meaning and message to leave an impression . The main are not more than shallowly , which is a lost opportunity with an actor such as Bill , and with a choice such as , whose young age is so obvious as to harm the credibility of the film . Even with a setting like the futuristic Japan , the movie is not able portray anything which is not already old and rugged from repetition . All in all , if you are an insightful or a masterly directed film , you could very well end up disappointed .",0
"I  t see this movie in theater but I too and it was too late . I  t wait for it to come out on so i could go rent it . The first thing that came to my mind when this movie ended was  wow what a great movie from Florent ( the directer ). He did a very good job one of a kind movie . the one who wrote this novel is very smart for think of something like this it is terrific . The script is brilliant and i seen a movie like this in a long time . Plus I see ( Jeff ) like this in a long time too . All the in this movie were just wonderful and all the were well designed .

"If you really enjoy torture and senseless killing , this film is for you ! It all of twisted people killing of innocent people for the hell of it . There are no  good  here , just evil people , who I think are supposed to be cool . Which is what is so about this film . Rob Zombie to be saying , that murdering and torturing people is fun and hip . You can brag that this film is disturbing and you would be correct , but is that anything to brag about ? I guess seeing young tied up and tortured is a thrill to somebody that was never able to get them , which is where Zombie and his seem to be coming from . It is kind of a revenge film for those that never were able to get with the attractive and popular crowd , you know , the future serial .",1

He all the of the movie that were too hard to act out on screen , because Stone to fill up most of the movie with mindless between and his men . I mean , the whole point of a movie is that you are told the story visually . But in this movie , you see a bunch of riding around on as what is happening .

"Since  historical accuracy  is a theme in the discussion of this movie , it is that so many have now rushed to defend it and suggest that the were wrong . Unfortunately , most of the acting and dialogue really is that bad . Brad , who shown he can act when he to ( Fight Club , Ocean  s Eleven ), unfortunately into the trap of self - importance that his one - note performance in of the Fall . He also to buy into the notion that any character in a would - be - and - epic must speak with a accent . His flat delivery is laughable and seem like he is pouting when he should be tormented . Thankfully , Cox to realize that the script is sub par , so he by gleefully the scenery . He at least some life in his . is game enough , and ( for the most part ) to defeat some more of the ludicrous dialogue . , however , does nothing to suggest why was worth all the fuss . Bloom  s facial while watching the Hector - duel are so bad they would seem sub par in an Wood movie . The screenplay is especially disappointing , given that wrote the excellent script for 25th Hour . His take on the legend by giving real for the character  s is actually quite inspired , especially as to why would really want to invade Troy . However , these story are eventually sunk by the insipid dialogue ( There are no between men and  and  It is too early in the day for killing   t even cut it in a Star ). The notable exception is a scene between and , which finally out some of the in the movie . Not all is lost , however . Peter O  gracefully every scene in which he . The scene in  tent is a tribute to both him and . They turn this into a great scene despite  s dreadful line and laughable to seem . The well - duel between and Hector is a worthy set piece . Saffron and Bean also excel in ( unfortunately ) lesser . Overall , the worthy are not enough to compensate for the half - baked whole . Given that this one of the cornerstone in world mythology , consider this film to be a great opportunity .",0

"June 12 , 6 : 30pm Theater - North long reflection of a sad and unpleasant memory was my first impression as the rolled on Last Days . There is beauty in the composition but also decay and ugliness in the content . Drawn out vacuous extend into tedium that must be intended as contemplation , but is no . There is a breath of life here and there . Blake  s last gasp of inspiration , alone with his music and from the outside with an unflinching stillness as solid as the of the house is both mournful and heroic . A far bigger problem is fact from fiction and the intent of the film itself . Even a made up revisionist biography would be better in the assent and glory rather than the miserable decline . A film that the birth of the scene , The Vogue and Sub Pop would be a wonder . Beautiful or not , Last Days is the morose and morbid vision of a dying . I  d sooner recommend  s documentary than this indulgence . The two of  s The General I saw at the after - party was more entertaining .",0
"This movie was not trying to be the end all of , so I don  t recommend it for who desire an entire revival . However , it was a cute movie . I was pleasantly by this movie . It was like they did not try too hard to make it any one particular thing . It was about 95 of some humor , some drama , and some love , combining for the perfect potion of success . Don  t have high , because this is definitely not an hit , but the movie what it set out to do : make a romantic comedy with a touch of magic . If you are looking for a simple comedy with a little bit of love , go see this movie . I definitely recommend it .",0

"I just got back from an advance screening of Stealth and I must say , as a very picky person , I was rather by the movie overall . I  attempt to right a fair summary :) To start I must say Stealth is a good package of action , comedy , drama , politics , even a little romance . Despite a few of my own , I would have to say this is one of the best I  seen this year . It definitely beat in my book , and not so hokey overall as to batman . I would have a hard time which had a better story . I would possibly put it above War of , but only because I  t very happy with the overall feel of WoW . On to some key point : : 8 At some seem distorted , ( mostly in the zoom ), but overall pretty realistic and a lot of interesting effects ( combat and otherwise ). The camera action was well done , very authentic , not like in some ( ie Borne Supremacy ). Plot : 9 The plot the trailer closely , but many that you won  t expect . will happen that some people won  t like , but overall these add to the  feel  of the movie and it really you wonder what next ? Overall the plot was very good . : 8 I have to say they the out pretty well in this one , though at some you will be by the amount of stereotyped . As a whole , it well and the progression of character development was smooth and felt about right most of the time . : 7 I really don  t even feel right giving this a 7 , but there was a lot of good banter with the bad . One of the biggest I have is the amount of in this movie . Anyone that anything about the military will know what I mean when they see this . Other than that most of the are fairly well , and there is a good integration of comedy and romance into the serious nature of the movie . That  s all I can come up with right now , but I hope it  s enough of something to think about .",1
"..... the acting was great but the actual movie ? kind of lame . it out extremely suspenseful , but is soon lost when the plot comes into play . i can say that i got out and out of my chair a few times , but this was only because of the shock value . i would rate this movie 5 / 10 and would not see it again . for anyone wanting a good scare i wont recommend this . but for anyone just wanting to waste an afternoon or anyone who crazy ... this is a pretty decent movie for you . personally i would rather watch : the ring house of wax or unbreakable . i think that m . night whatever guy is the master of . the village was kind of slow , but if you  re wide awake and involved , its an up movie to say the least . i love house of wax i don  t see why everyone to hate it . it me so so much . mostly because of the gore and like the brutal . by the way , the skeleton key had NO gore or death or anything . i think the part is when goes to that gas station and turns around to see the blind old lady with the baby . that was scary as hell ! the part in either or the is whenever you see one of those dead . like that is extremely up . finally i think that the part in house of wax is when or whatever his face like partially off . like !",0
"I do not know how to begin praising this movie . The plot was amazing and it goes very deep . The relationship between the is just so real that I felt like I was taken into the movie myself . I felt like I was there actually watching everything happen . I  never been interested in boxing , but this was because the movie was about so much more than the sport . It was obvious to see that Swank  s character , was not a failure even though she wound up on the floor after fighting for the winning title . She won because she what she to achieve in life , and there  t many people who can be satisfied with that . This movie can teach us all something about life and how to appreciate it and though many may find the message behind the movie , I don  t think it could be enough since we all forget how to appreciate life over and over again . The acting was amazing . Clint , Swank , and Morgan Freeman work so well together , and I had no reason to be displeased with how they out their . Warning : If you have not yet watched the movie , do not read the next paragraph . It will ruin the ending for you !! The only part of the movie which confused me was when the cord .  t this illegal and immoral to some people ? I  m not sure if he should have done this . The movie was really good so I  m not going to dwell on this . It  s just that he such a fatherly relationship with and it  s kind of odd to see him make the choice he .

I will also tell you that I honestly  t bring myself to watch this movie a second time ; it just such a raw intensity to it and the ending hit you so hard that you  re not sure whether to cry or cringe . It was the mother in this film , though , that really got me . You are to her as a sad , lonely mother who nothing but good in what she does . And as her story at the end you will want to do nothing but mourn at the unfairness of it all . Of course most of this to the rest of the main as well . One specific scene , though , when the mother ( and you  know what I  m talking about when you watch it ) is giving a speech to her son is really just what broke my heart and nearly brought me to .

"i went to see this movie something along the of , with dogs instead of snow . while i certainly was not disappointed at all with the dogs , i was definitely disappointed in the story . Lane is cute but annoyingly passive as , and is typically quirky but definitely appealing as Jake . i  t have a hard time sympathizing with Jake as he was written , but i quickly found and her life to be a bit of an impediment to go and enjoying the movie . her lack of willingness to take some control over what  s going on in the first half of the movie is grating , and her later to take control make her seem unbalanced rather than powerful . however , is at his usual engaging level of character portrayal , which made the movie still pleasant to watch despite the fact that the ending is terribly predictable in the most obvious   style of romantic resolution ( and there are quite a few eye - rolling in the denouement afterward ). as far as the supporting cast , it  s a mixed bag . Ben is an acting eyesore and i wish i never had to see him act again . despite the fact that i like  acting , her character Carol made me want to yell at the screen . happily , is totally charming and charismatic as Dolly , the eccentric somewhat - of  s father . i believe is going to inherit Ruth  s role as the perfect awesome older woman .

Pleasantly and surprisingly funny at times , the humour is quality ; good comedy , and not just for a drama . Also heartfelt throughout , the that this film leaves me believing that this may have and I can wholly . In addition to being well structured , the coda of the movie is unpredictable , ending on a happy note ; though its arrival was a surprise .

"The film could be to be involved in a conversation concerning the  best worst ever made , as it is successful in the certain mood necessary for trash cinema . This noir piece of pulp fiction is filled with the necessary violence and vulgarity to fully envelope the audience so that the film  s luridness them feeling the fun and humour in it , whilst still uneasily about how this is going to effect them in the future . seem to always take stage in trash cinema and there is no exception here with the film seemingly revolving around the of genitalia and its attempt to recreate it . I would suggest that  final barrage of destruction upon his enemy  s will be one of the most of all underground cinema . The cinematography does at times drift from the trash cinema realm to appease a more audience . The camera work and subsequent of in solitary are definitely a highlight of the film , reminiscence of  s direction in  Raging Bull . will struggle to understand the purpose and poise of the film unless they are prepared for the . However , it is still unlikely that they will be able to fully appreciate what the film was for and what it . The film is well worth the time , satisfying those looking for cheap sustained from lurid , violence and those who wish to critic the film  s place among the great of trash cinema .",1
"I this movie .... for the first half of it .... then some must have thought well its to smart and sexy kill it with ridiculous drivel and action and very predictable ending . And it worked ... it . But Brad And are a god and a goddess . is so beautiful her very presence can act . Amazing beauty . Yes they do have a lovely sexual chemistry together but somebody had to dumb down this film and that is the sad part about it . Why cant they leave their sticky little off the creative direction of a film ? You can always tell when this sort of thing .. it goes from smart to really stupid in the blink of an eye . Order something sweet at the concession stand if you go see this at the theater . your best bet is to get it on for a rainy day . To bad the film got a hold this one .",1
"This is a VERY strange film . It some memorable , but overall , it  t work , probably because it , and the audience ,  t really seem to know what it actually is . Is it a comedy ? It a few funny . Is it a drama ? It a few of pathos and some of hero worship , fatherhood , and mid - life crisis . Is it an adventure film ? There are a few at excitement that fall curiously flat . Is it a - fi / fantasy ? Actually it pretty rooted in a warped reality , except for the exotic ( computer - sea .) Is it a satire of documentary film - making ? It several that seem to imply this . Is it an homage to ? There are a few of admiration for the undersea explorer . ( The boat is not  The Calypso  but  The .) Is it a parody of ? The fake documentary movie clips seem to be poking fun at the late , great oceanographer . Is it a Bill vehicle ? Although Bill is the star , and he is the type of laconic cad he at in the past , he to be it in here . ( I guess he already , more effectively , used up his  guy - in - his - - - - crisis  in  Lost in Translation .) Overall , like an exploratory ocean journey , this film is all over the map .",0
"The redemption is the first Frank  s movie which taken 7 - from the Academy but the film not a high profit . Why not ? Well , the story of this movie is too good to be true . The redemption is based on the book by King and certainly this is the most brilliant adaptation which ever based from the writer  . The playtime is rather long but to be not boring . It  s excellently produced , and the acting ( and especially Morgan Freeman ) is . The script is clever enough about the human  s and the escape from the prison . The and the story itself are clearly true .",1
"For most of us , we have only about the Phantom of the Opera , and the image we usually get is a masked man sitting in front of an organ . Imagine my surprise when I saw the movie for the first time . The were beautifully , and there was no doubt it took place in in it  s time period . and Webber  s choice of cast was ideal . and already had of musical experience under their belt , and had a natural gift ( despite being somewhat distracted by his singing lisp ), so the opera style of singing was bearable to the and did not threaten to break glass . The nicely , although a question often ,  What to the Phantom  s face to begin with ? This was neither in the movie nor the book , so it leaves an essence of mystery to the . What this even better is that it only slightly from the actual stage version of the show . and many more only to the effect a movie .",0
"I  got several animated in my private collection , even though I  m no longer a . And yes , I always buy them for myself , since I don  t have any ( and not on one soon either ) or a younger brother or sister . On the other hand , I must also say that I have a rather specific taste . I don  t really like the average fairy tale - like . I prefer like Ice Age , , The ,... in which some fine animation is combined with excellent humor . After seeing the trailer for this movie , I was really curious about it . Would it be for only , or would an adult like me also be able to enjoy it ?   the story of four at New York  s Central Park Zoo who have lived there all their , don  t know what life in the wild is like and don  t want to know it either ... except for the Zebra . When he out of his cage and a trip through the center of New York City , his the Lion , the Giraffe and the Hippo go after him to get him back . But the think that the four because they to go back to the wild and that  s why they are put on a boat and sent to a wild reserve in . However , when their ship is and their are accidentally thrown over board , they end up on a desolate island where they will experience what life in the wild can be like and how much it from what they have known all their ... Although this movie  t perfect - especially the last part  t always do it for me - I must say that I had a good time watching it . The for instance are excellent . I like the way the look ( even though they may perhaps not be as  perfect  as what you might see when had made them ) and the surroundings are marvelous ( New York city , as well as the island ). I guess it is just a matter of taste , but in my opinion you can  t really compare the different of animation . from and is different when you compare it to . What  s wrong with that ? If all the the same , everybody would complain and say that they never try to create their own style and are only what works . Next to the animation , I also the diversity in the . Take for instance . He  s the star of the Zoo and he it , while is a hypochondriac who always sick and is a huge hippo who clearly  t mind about her size . I even the zebra , always craving for attention , but not seen as interesting enough by the audience . And those four are also by some very good . Take for instance the who like military commando  s or the who act like they have a lot of style , but still do what any other monkey would do . I really the diversity in and had several good with each of them . When I read the from other , I sometimes can  t help smiling . The main reason for that is because some people seem to forget that this is just an animated movie , not a documentary . If you really want to see how these live and act , don  t you think it would be better that you watch the National Geographic Channel , go to a zoo or go on a safari ? I  m sometimes myself : Do they think the same about Road Runner and Wile E . Coyote ? Or do they really believe that a coyote how to work with dynamite and can fall of a 1000 . cliff without dying ? This is still an animated comedy so I don  t care whether the look truthful or not ( by the way : have you ever seen a monster like or a talking donkey in real life ? I haven  t , but that  t mean that I can  t like them ). The same for their on the humor or the - in their opinion - lack of it . They believe that the humor in the movie was only good for . I  m sorry , but I see that as an insult . I  m an intelligent 27 - year old with two college , but I  m still able to laugh with those  stupid  and  childish  and the situation humor like for instance falling in a field of cacti . When they see it in a movie or  Road Runner , they say it is excellent , but when it is done in an animated movie about some zoo - , they no - longer like it . Make up your mind people ... All in all this is a movie that will not only appeal to . The mature audience - it  t matter if they go watch it on their own or with - will have a good time with it as well . Next to a lot of situation humor , you will also get some fine to well - known , which your will probably not connect to another movie , but love anyway . My favorite reference was the  - scene in which falling out of the sky instead of rose leaves . Even though the end  t as strong as the biggest part of the movie , I still this movie enough to give it a 7 . 5 / 10 , maybe even an 8 / 10 . And if that that I  m an immature man , so be it ...",1
"House of 1000 to be an homage to horror of the 1970s but instead into what is essentially a bad parody of them . Written and directed by rock music star Rob Zombie , a self - professed fan of 1970s horror , House of 1000 almost every major beat of a film from that era , and the final result is , if only because you wonder how anyone would have thought this was a good film when it was . House of 1000 leaves no stone unturned in it  s attempt to emulate such as The Massacre ( it  s cousin ), Last House on the Left , The Have , and many more . There  t barely a shred of originality to be found , as almost every major plot element , scene and character is from some other ( better ) film . And when , House of 1000 that the whole is not merely the sum of it  s . The plot ( what there is of one ) is minimal : Four driving cross - county through the US , Jerry ( ), Mary ( ), ( ) and Bill ( ), stop off at a gas station run by the rather foul and unsavory Captain ( ) which to also feature a low - budget theme park style ride the  Murder Ride , the main attraction of which is local legend . Satan , who experimented on and was eventually at a nearby location . by this story , the set out to find . Satan  s impromptu gallows , only to end up with a flat tire in some rather spooky backwoods . A hitchhiker they picked up , Baby ( Moon , Rob Zombie  s real - life wife ), them shelter at her nearby house , which is inhabited by her mother , known as Mother ( Black ), Grandpa ( ), a towering giant Tiny ( ), her monosyllabic brother Rufus ( Allan ) and her other brother , ( Bill ). After a rather strange dinner and stage show put on by the family , the attempt to flee their , only to find themselves , bound and through various mental and physical at the of the insane Firefly clan . Pretty much everything in House of 1000 is . The the family flail about wildly , spouting out dialogue that is supposed to cause us to feel unease , but instead only of incredulity . It would be helpful if the were even the least bit three - dimensional , but that is not the case . The four teens are cardboard , providing us with nary a single sympathetic character . So when the various of torture start , any connection to anybody , we are just watching endless of depravity that is so over the top , it is not the least bit scary and instead comes across as an act of a director that to believe that the weirdness of what we are watching alone can make some kind of an impact . It  t . Anyone familiar with the Zombie is aping can see his source material shining through , but what he on screen is so overdone , so up as to be almost comical , in a rather morbid way . Zombie is trying so hard to live up to his childhood that he sight about what made those good in the first place . The film along from scene to scene , and a subplot where one of the victim  s ( Young ), an ex - cop , goes looking for them , that to attempt to try to interject some seriousness into the , but miserably with and some rather questionable acting . Zombie also his film with shot on video or post - to give us into other in the film , often as counterpoint to the main scene , but these prove to be simply and suggest that Zombie is to be  arty  but is instead merely annoying . The only element of the film that works is it  s opening sequence , set in Captain  s store , where the scenery mightily and a bit of black humor to the . He up again here and there , and is again diverting , but it  s not enough to save the film . Almost all the other are just going through the , little memorable to the screen . With a title like House of 1000 , you would imagine there is some gore to be found , and that goes without saying . While not quite the gross - out fest of : , House of 1000  t for those with a weak constitution , especially towards the end of the film , where Zombie his plot and effects to a new level of ridiculousness without a point . It  s obvious that Zombie an affection for the genre , and it is possible that he can create an effective horror film if he would simply pull it back five or six and assemble something a little more realistic and low - key . As it , House of 1000 would as one of the worst at a horror film in , and considering some of what I have seen , that is saying a lot .",0
"There to be two in one - supposed comedy from and the dramatic story of a young woman finding herself after an emotionally barren and abusive marriage . The movie would have been strong enough to stand on its own without . She was , out of place and not funny at all . She was a caricature and a tired stereotype of the big , soul - food cooking , gun - black Southern grandma . At first , I  t sure if I would like this movie or watch it all the way through -- all because of  s gutless and behavior . It  t feel realistic to me and way over the top in both the husband  s casual cruelty and  s meek acceptance of his behavior . No woman is going to just whine and whinny when her husband his other woman into their house and her out . I don  t care what race the woman is or how well bred she is supposed to be . was a sniveling , weak , lazy excuse for a woman who to have her head buried in the sand for the last 18 . It  t take anyone with half a brain , 18 to realize what a cruel , selfish and unfeeling person her spouse had turned into . herself to blame for her predicament . She  t try to better herself in any way during the course of her marriage ,  t put any money aside ( she  t have a career or of any kind ),  t seem to do any type of volunteer or help less fortunate than herself . She she - since she  t have them , she could have worked with and made a real difference in someone  s life . was comfortable in her role as the rich , idle prop for her husband and to him to give her meaning and value . It like her only in after she had been and dragged from her home . I  t feel sorry for her then either , because she  t fight back or stand up for herself in any way . Even going to court to legally claim what was rightfully hers too much effort for her . Even after she into  s house , she could have taken some college or some sort of training to assist her in getting a well paying and interesting job . She only went to work as a waitress because  t going to let her mooch forever . I  t like or respect this character at all . I felt she much the same way had her and if I were , I  t have taken her back . was selfish to the very end and no better than her husband . I think they actually deserved one another and should have together . deserved much better than . A , intelligent , witty and kind man is someone every woman and often  t have . should have him . Surprisingly enough , I did enjoy this film for many and none of them had to do with race , over - the - top acting , or  s ridiculous behavior . I thought the last scene in the church was extremely moving and powerful - not  getting up and walking down the aisle ( cheesy and predictable ), but the former crack head wife making the effort to herself and be with the family that she and who her . I cried when she down the aisle singing . I think this was a way to show us that a belief in God can change your life and help you to do anything you set your mind too . The character her family life back and knew that it was up to her to stop doing and turn her life around , so that she could be with them . She on her faith , and determination and God her cry for help and she was blessed . That is a lovely message for anyone to witness . If the movie said nothing else - that message was enough .",1
"Overall , this movie is more of a drama than it is a comedy . If you want to see this , please know that you  re a movie that is a mix of comedy and drama . But this movie was very good and I it a lot . Some are with me like this one and Hitch , and that are part music and romance creep me out . All of the bad on this movie  t be attention to because it was a movie with conflict and heart . Sure , it might be very tense , but without and her brother in the movie , it would be absolutely nothing . My point mainly is that this is a great movie that you can watch with your and your husband / wife , as long as the are at a proper age .",0
"It  s with a certain glee that I am my opinion on this  movie . Once in a while comes a movie that is so atrociously bad that it becomes fun to hate . is one of these . It  s easily ( too easily ) the worst movie of 2005 , but it  s also a strong contender for the worst movie of the last 5 . Before you dismiss me as a hater , know that I love ( and own on ) the full Matrix trilogy ( yes , even ) and My Own Private , definitely his best role to date . I  m also a big horror movie fan . So all in all I was really excited when I went to see that film . The trailer was awesome , I  t wait ! The film well , I mean the first 5 to 10 . It  s all downhill from there , in the most unexciting climax of all time , with Peter as the most ridiculous and non - threatening Satan ever . kind of his right by offering one of his most awful and wooden ever , on a par with his  work  in Brad Stoker  s , but worse , as in that movie he  t have such a long time on screen . Here , he  s there constantly , non - . . is good ( as always ), but not enough to save the film . I lost any interest whatsoever after half an hour , and the only reason I  t leave the theater was that I  t want to be rude to my mate , who I had dragged to see this . I thought maybe he was enjoying it . However , when the stupid and absolutely unexciting climax , I turned to him and  Are you enjoying this ? He  Are you ??  Should we leave then ? did I ask ...  It  s almost over , we might as well stay . Well we  t have . The ending was as bad as the rest of the movie . Oh , for those of you who think  it might not be fantastic , but I  watch it for the special effects ... a word of warning : the like a cheap video game , absolutely not realistic . Rent it if you must , but don  t make a blind buy , you will regret it bitterly !",0
"There are so many important surrounding this movie , but for one is the importance of social well being and understanding . Never before a movie so greatly pointed out the for racial discrimination , not just White people being small minded , but ALL of racism . The movie several different / , who all meet up at some point . Their however , all surround their discontent for other , whether it be , white , black or South . Cop , D . A ., housewife , car jacker , liquor store owner . It that all have been covered . Not to forget the unmissable drama that as a consequence of each . Make of this what you will , but I implore you ......... do everything you can to watch this movie . My personal opinion is that is should be shown in every single classroom around the world . ****** OUTSTANDING PIECE OF CINEMATIC REFERENCE **********",0
"I the movie and thought ( ) his part well . Peter ( Satan ) was exceptional in his portrayal of the dark side and  s ( ) performance as God  s angel of destruction was well . The script was well thought out and if the viewer at least a basic knowledge of the  end times  they will be able to follow the plot and appreciate the strong of the . Before watching the movie , all the I read were bad . I  m to say that they were all wrong ! I hope they intend to make a sequel ! After watching this movie I went out and bought my own copy !",0
"This movie is fantastic , based on a true story , the story of the unsinkable ship , ( well that  t work ) DI , and Billy where absolutely fantastic and how the were whipped around the set design the special effects and the were really done well . all in all this film is in motion picture history in my opinion . but it does get a little scary at the end and the way that at the end it was a little too cold not just in general . Titanic is the film to watch if you want a good cry and a slight scare romance and Billy at his best . Titanic will make you cry and leap for a cushion .",1
". AND . SMITH like a Woody movie . and Jane Smith sit looking at the camera , talking to the voice of a marriage counselor , revealing of their marital through awkward at casual humor . It is a nice beginning , but totally misleading . What to be into a clever , bittersweet , sophisticated drama about a failing marriage into a tiresomely violent and overwrought video game tale of suburban warfare . The twist , which the film as a surprise even though it is made apparent in all the advance advertising , is that and Jane are working for two rival , unidentified government . They marry not knowing each other  s little secret , which should indicate just how incompetent they are at their . Then for that are never made clear , they are assigned to kill each other . The result is the battle of the as an extreme sport . It is an insipid idea for a movie , yet nonetheless intriguing : taking domestic violence out of the of and leaving it to the . And as long as the cat and mouse between and Jane remains personal , the film a sharp satirical edge . The battle of the becomes more than a just an metaphor . The problem is that the film  t know where to stop and a screenplay that to become more and more outrageous up just getting more and more stupid . It is that the screenplay went through fifty and presumably each successive screenwriter added a   t it be cool if ... moment that them to exaggerate everything . When it on that would even be embarrassingly unbelievable in a Bond movie , the result is like THE WAR OF THE on : coyly malevolent but utterly incoherent . As the , Brad and have a fair amount of chemistry , most apparent in a dinner sequence where paranoia and cunning are up along with roast beef and extremely sharp carving . But as they tango through of sarcasm their witty banter literally out by , gunfire and squealing automobile . Then , even though it to resolve the conflict between the , the film on for another ultra - violent thirty designed to -- but totally failing at -- explaining the plot  s myriad . The film with a smug happily - ever - after in which nothing been resolved . Ultimately , the film no real point . As it systematically all the of middle - bliss -- marriage , suburban home , - van , . -- one that the original screenplay for . AND . SMITH hoped to join the of THE WAR OF THE ; DIVORCE , STYLE and even WHO  S AFRAID OF ? as a brittle commentary on the decline of the family . But the right to even be to such apparently was written out of the story during all those , with any sharp down by all the high - tech pyrotechnics . A film on adult out totally to juvenile comic book mayhem .",0
"Let me start by saying I LOVE randomly funny , virtually plot less Those are not the only I like mind you , I dabble in a bit of everything . But this film .... wow ... where do I start ? First off ; I thought it terrible from the , so I had no interest in seeing it when it was first . But everyone kept saying how funny it was . So I thought , well then maybe it is worth seeing . We watched it in one of my classes in high school and after the first half hour I put my on and fell asleep . So I thought , well maybe I just  t in the mood because I from more and more people how funny it was . So today , a person brought it into my summer school class , and we watching it . I when the farmer shot the cow in front of the school bus , and the line  why do you drink 1 % milk ? is that because you think you  re too fat ? But other than that , I found myself grinding my teeth and watching the clock . Also I was wondering why my teacher and I were the only people not laughing , he kept looking over at me with the  why the hell is that funny ? look on his face . To which I with a shrug . Then it hit me ... my teacher and I are the only in the class that do not do , weed . Then I also remember 2 / 3rds of the people who say it  s the movie ever made also said they were extremely high when they watched it . From what I  , people would find the film  The  funny when extremely high . So if you  re wondering about my topic title ... I was so fed up with the film and saw that it  t be over before the class ended , I just my teacher if I could leave , he said yes . So I came home , wrote this review and that will be the last I ever speak of it . So in summary , terrible film , no story AT ALL , anything remotely funny can be found in 100  s of other . GREAT film to watch if you  re a stoner , other than that .. stay away . I give this film 2 out of 10 and I give it 2 instead of one on the account that I 2 or 3 times .",1
"is the worst movie I  ever seen . I can  t believe it was a , big - advertisement movie . It was completely horrendous in nearly every aspect : the acting was about the class you can find , the plot was pathetic beyond imagination , and the whole of the movie was with obvious and irrational . Here is a list of some of the and . The most simple and irritating of the was when they  re in Antarctica and they  re walking around in a light winter coat and an exposed face . Yeah , pretty sure you  d die in like half an hour . In the pyramid there  s alien writing all over the and the go up and read it . It  s an alien language !!!! The Predator goes into the pyramid and he  s about to kill the old guy , but then he see  s the old guy a disease or something so he not to kill him . That  s fine and can be . But then as the Predator leaves the old guy , the old guy  Don  t turn your back on me ! And then he to torch the Predator with a lighter and some spray . COME ON !!! That  s got to be the movie moment of all time ! Picture this : You see a huge , hulking alien come up and is just about to kill you , but then he not to . So you tough talk the alien and try to burn him to a crisp ? NO ONE WOULD EVER DO THAT !!! When the Predator the girl that shield and spear , I thought to myself ,  Cool , she  s go around and impale some and stuff . But guess what ? She never the spear ! thing ever . There are probably some more big , stupid throughout the movie , but I  m going to leave it at that . Even without the , this movie . The plot was just a rambling series of idiotic , gory , slimy action . And the fight  t even cool ! The only cool part was when the Alien the Predator  s head with his extra mouth . That  s about it . A dumb thing that I  t get about that part was that the one Alien two . I thought the were way more powerful than , because in that on the pyramid there are three fighting of . I don  t know . The climax of the movie was just a cry for help . I had no idea what was happening . They were all fighting and stuff , and before I knew it , they were running away and the pyramid up for some reason . It was extremely abrupt . And that  s pretty much the whole movie in its entirety .",1
"I would give this a 10 if it filled in a few more for me but the movie would have been 4 long if it did . Swank was fantastic in this and you can  t help but fall in love with her attitude , determination and unselfishness . Clint was perfect in this role , he me of my grandpa , angry at the world in his own lovable way . My biggest criticism is that they don  t go into enough of his past to explain him . Morgan Freeman perfectly right along side Clint and they do a great job the of long time . There is a magical touch to this film that is indescribable , you can feel the connection between the and you feel like you are watching something real . Unfortunately the ending leaves you a little down and incomplete . I think they could have cut that shorter and me the long drawn emotional pain . All in all it was a great film and definitely worth your time .",1
"I had no idea that this was based on a comic until I actually watching the . the effects . Scene where the guy the Spear of Destiny , ( becomes possessed ) and hit by the car - Priceless .

Scene were leaves the gas station and is by a demon (.. of ) - Priceless . Scene where the guy ( forgot his name - he was a priest ) goes to the morgue and  s body , out and to quench his need for liquid but can  t ... priceless .

Scene where the the priest in the store ... one of the half breed  s his death - the store clerk who was bent down over him ... the ... the am the biggest horror fan of , , . and the biggest critic of anything that  s supposed to be scary , I was definitely to the .

"By on an archetypal instead of A List or near it , this gave a surely more realistic view of high school life than many other . Heder  s performance as the central character is amazing ( look at the way he ). His awkwardness with , and the awkwardness of a girl who is obviously to him , ring true . There were many extremely funny ( I particularly the way the bully was off ), and the subplot with Napoleon  s even more brother was entertaining , especially his interaction with Uncle , the nitwit ex - jock forever wanting to get back to 1982 ( a good gag here which I won  t reveal ). You have to watch to beyond the to see a final scene - they might have us !",1
"I guess the old saying  Every dog its day  is true but also perhaps no more in a way than it can be applied to Southern and .  Hustle & Flow , written and directed by Brewer , is a movie about that one shot . It  s about how everybody  s got a dream , and they only get one chance to grasp it and hold on to it . From the outset , this could have been a laughable , if not completely stereotypical   flick about aimless who attempt to brighten their dim outlook on life through hip - hop . In all , from the on television , that  s what it to be but when you actually see the movie in action , a whole new dimension is revealed . Hustle & Flow  through its story the same way most  dream  do but somewhere in there , we get a genuine feel for the and their , and an especially profound performance from lead actor as , a Southern hustler who suddenly himself writing almost every minute of the day . As I write this , I  m still humming the in my head ( Whoop that trick ! Whoop that trick !). Of course with those , come and with the come , powerful . The of a truly good rap song , in my view , originate in deep meaningful that are written from the heart , and that  s how  s flow . ( I  m aware his are hardly inspiring , but you get the idea .) As the Southern hustler / pimp in a mid - life crisis , the mode is turned on for when a him one of those old electronic . He around with it for a little bit , as he that he had one himself when he was little boy but soon a light on , and is tossing around like a football . He his to an old high school buddy , a . k . a .  Key  ( , in a nice turn - around role from his usual comedic ), who currently demos for his church . When first his plan to him , Key is discreet ,  A lot of people talk the talk , but don  t walk the walk , as he at first he  s not serious . Key  s wife ( Neal )  t especially happy by this sudden turn of for her husband but he  s profoundly touched , as is , by the sound , and the two are quickly chanting  Whoop that trick ! like it  s the , but is at least supportive enough to remind them that even they have to eat dinner . Meanwhile , must also with the worrisome of his current reality , from live - in stripper ( Parker ) and her baby son , both of whom he eventually out of the house , to his pregnant ( ho , or main ? I  m not sure ) Shug ( P . ), who eventually the chorus of his , and ( Manning ), who also to do something else with her life . Together , with and white boy disc jockey ( ), everybody , in a fashion much like a family , begin recording demos left and right with a makeshift studio in  s house . Hustle & Flow  is pleasantly surprising in a way that a lot of black -  t . It a genuine spirit that  s carried on the of its lead performer , , who with that unique Southern hustler drawl and slang that his character all the more realistic and believable . He  s simply brilliant in this role , as I  he  s no stranger to music himself and his in this film seem so inspired you  d think he a shot at a career as a rap star . What all of their hard work eventually in , of course , is a chance meeting with a rapper from who to blow up and is featured prominently on television and such ; his name is Skinny Black ( real - life rapper Ludicrous ), who he school with . the opportunity on 4th to slide Skinny Black his tape and have him put the thing on the radio . Hustle & Flow  on a note of deep profundity . Does blow up and become the huge star he to be ? I won  t tell , but the movie in such a way you  d think it was true about people with . Key that life  t always pan out the way it should for some people , but that also , sometimes , it does . The thing about it is , he  s right . Note : As a fan of rap , it is true what about how much of popular music arose from or in the South ( in addition to a lot of good ), from Development , to , to the , to Ludicrous himself ( whom I  m no big fan of ). Note # 2 : Yes , I  m aware that  Ludicrous  is correctly ; it auto - corrected by for some reason so please just ignore the spelling . 8 / 10",1
"I  seen this movie and I was totally not because I found a very good movie but because I found it nothing to do with what I or may be to what all of us ! I think that we all a horror movie or may be a thriller and that  s from the trailer and the quote of the movie and everything else but what I really found was a drama ! And a very good one too ! The story is a very good one a very interesting topic too , the idea that this is the current time and those people chose not to live in that world because of it  s cruelty and chose to hide away in a natural preserve and make a myth about unknown so that no one goes into the and so that they be kept safe from today  s world . I think that it  s a very good movie and it  s totally even by me !!!!",1
"I saw the preview of this movie a couple of ago and it . You can  t help but feel sympathy for . This movie you that in a split second your whole life can change , and most of the time in a bad way . is absolutely powerful in this role . As much as I his character in Crash , I felt so sorry for this character ( ) he so well . I , cried and silently to myself , how many people live like this . Sometimes just a dream is not enough . I hope this movie the recognition he so . I have been for him for a while now and hope that this will be his breakthrough .",0
"I can  t see how in the world this thing came to be so . First and foremost , everything about it hackneyed and , it an air of cheap 80s teeny about it . The plot is plain silly - a mishmash of tacky , time - warp , bogeyman , and expectedly , teen angst . Now , supposedly , some such incredibly over - the - top may have made for some classic B - in the past . But even in of camp or trash value , this film is too square and too large a budget to offer any entertainment . There  s nothing genuinely funny or frightening in it , despite noticeable . About a half way through I ended up yawning myself senseless and reaching for  stop . Perhaps the ( fortunate ) neglect of the involved during the 90s is accountable for this film  s popularity amongst its generation of teens , to whom this may seem a novelty . It is possible that the poor quality of the story and dialogue is thus .",0
"Good film overall ... The plot is good too , however there are within the film itself ( e . g 1 /: the fact that When Rose is in New York half asleep , she at the Statue of Liberty , which is the colour green . But if you visit the statue of liberty , you  find a plate telling you that the original colour was brown , and it took over 35 for it to change colour . The statue of liberty was there in 1886 , so in 1912 it should have still been partly brown .. e . g 2 /: In the engine room as the ship is sinking , the smoke and steam coming from the machinery at the same angle as the ship , about 45 . So , the shot was level , then afterwards ).",1
"As THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH , we meet oceanographer ( Bill ), who is his latest  adventure  to an audience in . During this recent expedition , a member of the crew , ( ), is by what to be a  jaguar shark . When if he will continue to seek this mystical creature , he that he is going to find it and kill it . From the brief description above , it may be hard to imagine these opening as being humorous , but they are . They also serve as the spark point for the  plot  of THE LIFE AQUATIC , which is the latest comedic drama from director , who taken as his inspiration the of . Now I have put the word plot in quotation because most of the in AQUATIC serve as , each with distinct internal , that in an indirect way advance the actual story ( the quest for the shark ). This is made all the more apparent by brief of a crew member , by , Bowie in . These with ( who also the ) serve almost like a curtain in a play , something that the transition to the next act . This theatrical tone is also present in the large cross section mock - up of the ship which for more lengthy ( which would have been impossible on a real ship ). This is the technique that is employed as the ship is and the crew : ( Angelica ),  s wife and the  brains of the operation ; ( ), a German seaman with emotional ; ( who was great in SHINE ) is the / radar operator who also the music for the two small ( AQUATIC  s actual score , by Mark , is wonderfully cheesy ); various of the underwater camera crew and the ship  s   who are put to manual labor and other unpleasant . There are also many : one  s producer , ( ), who to have generating funds for the antiquated cinematic of the fading oceanographer . There is also  s rivalry ( both professionally and personally ) with a well  corporate  explorer ( Jeff ). Jane ( Cate ), an attractive reporter , the crew to write a story about the ship  s . She up falling for ( ) who may or may not be  s biological son . As you can probably deduce , THE LIFE AQUATIC a vast array of story and . It is for this reason that the actual plot ( shark revenge ) is kept open and abstract . is more concerned with the interplay of the large cast than with any linear progression of the story . It is this fragmented style that the film to diverge in many bizarre . The humor of AQUATIC is very dry and self - , which in the from wacky physical humor to warmhearted drama to fairly graphic violence . It is actually the foreign who hijack  s ship , and the subsequent resolution during a rescue operation , where I the most . I  m not sure what that about me , per se , but it is to  s credit that such do not sabotage the entire film . That said , the unevenness of the feel somewhat disjointed at times and if a viewer does not accept  s sly tongue - in - cheek humor , THE LIFE AQUATIC could give the aesthetic of a mess . One to , in a certain sense ,  dive  into AQUATIC , disbelief and rolling with the the director made . I do respect the film for taking and not to popular taste , but for a production that received such a large theatrical release it would seem to have somewhat limited appeal . THE LIFE AQUATIC to be continuation of director  s overall vision . The one thing that it does from is that his previous film , THE ROYAL , was damn near perfect . To make such a film so early in one  s career , that all will be measured against that high - water mark . Now this is , admittedly , unfair but I am going to do it anyway . AQUATIC the chemistry in the cast of THE ROYAL ( or for that matter ), which this large ensemble piece feel a bit . more sure of who to use and when for the right effect in . This was by an extraordinary central performance by Gene Hackman who was much more giving and low key in contrast to Bill . is good , but a performance style that is somewhat . Actually many of the ( , and included ) each have such a distinct presence that they don  t blend as smoothly into the work . , , , and particularly Angelica , seem to understand the dynamic better . They their , which is especially crucial in the oddly sweet relationship between Jane and . THE LIFE AQUATIC a while to get going , but in the end , I the film . There are many memorable and clever and I applaud the for stop - motion animation ( produced by Henry of NIGHTMARE BEFORE fame ), not in the creation of the film  s many whimsical sea . It is  s knack for character design and ultimately his ( borderline obsessive ) attention to the that continue to make his a rewarding experience . 7 / 10",1
"Napoleon Dynamite is unique . Not only is it shot in a different style to other , but the humour is on its own . In fact , it is a perhaps a new genre of comedy . Its main strength is that it goes into which have yet to be touched in the movie industry . Unlike most which rely on gross schoolboy , this movie a many great which are intricately timed , and most importantly , rely on the strict observation of the viewer . Revolving around some very strange and unique , the film is about the rise to acceptance of a geek in . However , it is not as primitive as the subject matter . It is very subtly done . So subtle in fact , that most comedy will not even understand what is meant to be funny . There are so many . Most are to do with in on the of the . I highly recommend it to those who want a different comedy .",1
"In many ways Titanic is a great movie . The effects are realistic enough to let you get right into it and the are generally very good ; especially the gorgeous who with , or without , her kit on . It is a story of an ill fated but grand love affair . An unhappy heiress for a lovely poor guy over the rich , handsome , total bastard she  s engaged to and trouble inevitably . This epic story is out against the backdrop of a ship sinking which to the emotion , poignancy , hysteria and general tearfulness of it all and therein my problem with this flick . Before Titanic was a film it was a ship . Many real people . Their still remember . ( yes even a century later ), This movie is not a tribute or an insult . It is a of their memory . Jack and Rose could have had their moment in any one of a thousand . Why sully this tragic event ? The sinking of the Titanic is a great historical tragedy . Not only death , but needless death , plus the loss of a magnificent machine , which was a tribute to human and ingenuity . The folly of her reckless handling in dangerous ( That  s the ship , not ). The stupidity of man  s  unsinkable  challenge to nature . The struggle of the crew to save as many people ( especially rich ) as possible . What a great film that could be ( they tried to make it in 1958 ). A story that every gasp for air , every self sacrifice , every bloody engineer . Why did we need Jack and Rose ? Is this the price we pay for .",0
"Let me just start by saying this movie was . It  t a blow you away type movie . The acting is just terrible . The only person who the movie is Furlong . Tara really the movie down . And out of the four Crow I would have to say Wicked Prayer would come in 4th place . The first Crow excellent !!! Then you have City of I would put that in 3rd place . And Salvation coming in 2nd . I think Salvation was the most different of the four . But anyway , Wicker Prayer  t do anything to ruin The Crow franchise . I love these . You can  t compare the who have The Crow cause they all bring their own sense of style and charisma . Lee as Eric of course if my favorite . But the other three did a good job also . So what I am just saying is if you like the crow you will like this one . Just don  t expect it to be excellent .",1
"I used to think that there could only be one transcendent movie in a decade , or even in two . Transcendent just don  t come along very often . But here we are in the 00  s , and that old belief of mine been .  Man , the best movie of the year , was the first transcendent film I  d seen this decade . I thought that was it . But then came  Me and You and Everyone We Know , a magical and breath - taking and , yes , transcendent debut for writer / director / star . I  never seen a film quite like this , and I  never seen a film that made me feel the way this one does . Me and You and Everyone We Know  is a quirky look at contemporary life . is a performance artist and Elder Cab driver . Her art is unknown and her cab driving job is mostly mundane . One day she a lonely and confused shoe salesman . is coming off of a divorce and is struggling to connect with his sons . His attempt to impress them with a pyrotechnic display badly burned his hand , and his distraction with him and the farther apart . He to cut his connection to . younger son , , is in the middle of an illicit romance with a stranger . The elder son , Peter , is fascinated by the ten - year - old girl next door , who is already a dowry for a marriage she  t think will come for at least twenty . Heather and are two neighborhood who are the object of a perverted man  s obsession . Amused , they practice sex on Peter before going to the dirty old man  s door . They think they are mature , but learn that they are just the opposite . While watching , I was of tapestry like  Magnolia  and  Short , but  Me and You  is different somehow . It  s more realistic and personal . It  s like someone actually turned the people in their neighborhood into movie . The people in  Me and You   t glamorous or especially smart or funny . Their average people with average . This is the stuff that every day in the real world . We just so happen to be lucky enough to sneak a peek at a neighborhood that  t our own . The fact that this is  s first time doing anything filmic is stunning . She her vision to life both in front of and behind the camera with such assurance and confidence that one could easily think she was an old hand at it . Her style of dialogue , her method of acting , and her ability to perfectly construct a scene are what most and wish they had . Take for example the scene where and walk down a sidewalk together . about how the sidewalk is like the path of their relationship , and every step and . Just before reaching the end , the two separate and go their own ways , but can  t stop looking back over her shoulder . While it  t sound like much in theory , it is incredible on the screen . After you see it , you will look back and think  that was a perfect scene . It  s one of the most perfect ever thanks to the excellent writing and direction and  s performance as ( credit is due to as well , who the perfect sounding board in the scene ). Me and You and Everyone We Know , much like  s performance art , the beauty of just being alive . It left me with a sense of the beauty in the world around me , and that is something few ever do . No other film I  seen to do what this one does , and  Me and You  should be for that . This is the kind of film you  t find in or in you local Multiplex . It  s better and more special . is a promising talent . If she can continue on the path she begun , she will have a long and successful career . Trust me . This film is going to get a lot of attention at the Independent Spirit , and it  s going to put on the map .))<>(( FOREVER .",1

HOTEL a departure for director Terry , who is from Northern , and worked almost exclusively with on about that region . Here he tension without and the to develop . He a human face to the abstract bloodshed of during the , but preaching or over the harrowing subject matter . The cinematography , production design and music help in the time and place . HOTEL effortless in its portrayal of the , but these are , in fact , the to make . It was difficult for me to imagine a film about the genocide in as a - 13 rating . In a way it is good because the film will reach a audience and shed light upon a recent atrocity which was at the time and been largely forgotten since . seen various on the subject , read participant  s and seen chilling of with , the true scale of violence was staggering . HOTEL does not quite capture the brutality and horror of the where of people used car and bicycle to kill as well as  . It instead to focus on the personal story of and his . He is a brave man who saved the of many through his , although chance to have a large part . The film should also help us look ahead to the in the region of the where many of the same are happening today and which been by other world . The message of HOTEL to be that something like this can happen at , in anyplace , and that each instance is as worthy of our attention as the next . I hope this film will continue to have an impact but in the long term it is people , not , that will make a difference . 10 / 10",1

It disgusted me . Now , many later , I in to see it at the local second - run theater ( Bless it ) and I had one heck of a good time .  Lemony Snicket  s  A Series of Unfortunate  is a surprisingly great film !

"s first feature is quite impressive , funny , original and surely directed . The film is especially impressive in the early that establish  s isolation from the rest of the world . The movie to shift from comedy to drama easily . And Portman one of her charming as one of those sweet , quirky but only mildly neurotic who are so much easier to find in than in real life . But while it is a very good movie , I felt it lost emotional resonance towards the end . This is most striking in the final scene between and his dad , which should feel like a summation of emotional in the movie but instead like something that just  t sufficiently set up . The problem may be that I but never felt that strongly in his life . I can  t really point to anything specific and say , this should have been done different , I just should have felt more in the last 15 of this movie than I did . Still , well worth watching .",1

"I with extreme impatience for the film release of one of the of recent . In many , the film was superior to the stage production , which I saw in in the very early 90  s - mostly due to the availability of special effects , technology and precise of , whilst a staging a continuous flow from scene to scene . The production , and costuming were immaculate , the direction ranged from good to the sublime , and of course the music was glorious , beautifully to the immaturity of the  s ( ) voice - was an experienced , trained classical singer and it would be unfair to expect the same power and richness to be present in  s voice at just 17 of age . ( ) was a glorious surprise - who would have suspected that he would have such a voice . It was so very enjoyable to see his character given greater prominence in the film . The major disappointment , and the only item holding the film back form a 10 out of 10 , was the unbelievably poor performance by The Phantom ( Butler ). Usually a wonderful actor to watch , in  The Phantom of the Opera  he was wooden and clumsy - when he  s supposed to be seducing into his den of musical , he rather to be dragging a reluctant student to the headmaster . The tortured soul of the genius Phantom is nowhere to be found , rather we see a spoilt little boy temper - when he  t get the he . All of which could have been excusable , if his singing  t so absolutely appalling . In this day and age where we have the technical brilliance to change a bad voice to a # 1 hit , why was so little attention to poor Butler . Beside his apparently complete lack of ability to colour his voice with or dynamics ( except  loud  or  soft ), there were far too many when his singing was just plainly flat . It was an excruciating pain to anyone who truly the original music and . in  My Fair Lady  had her singing , so ( even though this was a very expensive [$ 95 M ] independent production )  t the same have been done here ? Sorry , Messieurs & - Webber , but your casting here was a horrible flaw that dragged down the luster of an otherwise exquisitely beautiful production .",0

"At the beginning , they summed up the situation as it was with a couple of written of description .

You never make the mistake of taking the film too seriously ( Which , given its in Crow 1 as a pseudo - horror could be a bad thing ), but its not  A laugh a minute . There are no plot - which given a lot of in recent is actually a relief , the bad are bad to the end - though all except the main villain show of doubt . I will say though , Crash  s character - or more particularly , what to him , is never fully till near the end . There  s also not much confrontation going on between The Crow and the bad ...

"In my childhood , I watching on tape from National Geographic , especially on wildlife . I was always fascinated in how those in the wild ( and the as well ) go through life , how they eat , how they struggle and persevere , how they mate , , and the craft behind the was equally fascinating . March of the , which is the first documentary in this vein that I  seen in many a moon , is no exception . While for many who  t ( or  t ) big on those or the Discovery channel or other may wonder what  s the point in a film about , for a particular audience it  s like candy that  t really rot your mouth . It  s simple storytelling , and it a kind of spell on those who find interesting . I  m sure those who love will make this a must - see event of the summer . There  t a  plot  really , but as the narrator us through the story ( here being the instantly recognizable Morgan Freeman ), we learn how the Emperor deal with life on the surface of Antarctica . They come up to breed , and then lay their and bring up their young , but their are many - the deathly , way below - zero cold , the arduous walk across the tundra to feed , and the care that must be taken with the when they  re . All of this is done in almost a - epic kind of way , and director ( and his Chalet and ) does some amazing . Although many who see the movie won  t take it much into account ( and it  s sort of taken for ), the cinematography is crucial for a film like this , and on that level the film works on that match up and even surpass the I watched as a child . After a while , I almost forgot there was tough craft in this , which is also remarkable - that they were able to film these in this environment , without being too obtrusive , and make it seem cinematic . For all , March of the is a little gem in a summer flooded with and , and the fact that it  s becoming the sleeper hit of the season ( it  s reportedly made more per - screen than War of the ) is equally surprising .",1
"The Bad News , is a remake of the 1976 film of the same name . The film is about an alcoholic exterminator Morris Buttermaker , who to coach a youth baseball team basically for the money . When he first the team he that they do not know how to play baseball at all so he to get them into shape to win the championship game . To help him do this he his daughter ( from a previous marriage ), who he not seen in and a troublesome motorcycle rider Kelly . Coaching one of the rival is Bullock , a coach who is about winning . With the of anger and alcohol problem the will have to get used to Morris , and he will have to get used to the troublesome as well . This remake of The Bad News , is by , who is one of my modern day and after a bunch of cult and independent this is his third film after The Newton ( which I have never seen ), and The School Of Rock . The film also Billy Bob , who I thought was very good in such as Sling Blade , and Bad . With a good director and good actor I thought this film would be pretty good but it  t . The character of Morris Buttermaker , is very similar to Billy Bob  s character Willie in the film Bad , and in some ways the film is a lot like Bad ( so seeing as two of the screen did Bad , is not surprising ). The film to deliver the same type of rude and profane that worked wonderfully in Bad , but the a lot tamer for a - 13 audience and they just don  t work . They almost feel like from Bad . And the film  t do a whole lot for me and it was fairly predictable and in a lot of ways you could see where the movie was going . I have not seen the original 1976 version of The Bad News , but I  am a person who strongly and does not think that they are necessary at all . This is a remake that probably  t have to be made because it flat soon and not even the talent of , or Billy Bob can bring it back to life . A big disappointment from both these .",1
"Whole movie full of & illogical behavior , only fighting and without any necessary decoration . I can not image how could a killing company exist so obviously and so modern , even can rent in a huge mansion without known by property client . Where is . Smith  s company , and what  s the name of it ? Why so many killing design a trap and dispatch so many personnel to kill them both , only because they are husband and wife and they might disclose too much more than they should ? There is just no reasonable explanation but contradiction instead . mass weapon fighting and the gas in the house , will that only cause a little noise to ? A well group with machine and , but only a bomb made them . God help their strong house finally being , and they both could survive with almost nothing hurt . I do not know why I waste too much time to write the comment especially under such badly expression level . The movie just made me feel disappointed and .",1
"I recently this film and the moment I out of the theater , I made phone to inform other and family that they should see this film , ToDAY ( opening ). I was amazed ( not because he is an excellent actor ) at performance . I could really feel his spirit as he brought this character to life . The supporting cast was excellent as well . P . , Parker , and Manning . There were some excellent between all three . This film me of the of blues , the true blues . Although its coming from a pimp and his so   it is his blues and his struggle . Very real to life . Of coarse some will look down upon this film because it with a pimp and his , but this is the most real to life experience I  ever seen in the media about this . This film the rawness of it all , that it was not  and slap a hoe . I suggest you check out this film , you wont be disappointed .",1

We and and for a plot that never even thought about , everything that was supposed to be funny  t , and I quickly a point where I to slap brother Kip hard enough to knock the taste out of his mouth .

"I don  t know about the rest of you , but I found the New Bad News to be absolutely hysterical . Yeah , there were some that were than , but I still left the theater with in my stomach and from laughing so hard . Many people lately have been over this summer of , and I have sometimes been one of them , but I found that this Bad News did what a remake should do : update a classic to reach a new audience without insulting the integrity of the original . Many of the same are included in this film , and several from the original have simply been into the remake . Billy Bob is great , once again channeling is Bad attitude as Coach Buttermaker , and easily the beginning of the picture . Soon , much like the original , the bad of the come into play , and the humor comes directly from the various . Tanner is still the , and many of the are different from the original , a bound Bear who often his physical situation a cause for argument . And while all that is good from this film the bad , there are some bad , primarily . Much like School of rock , chose an actual pitcher to play the role , and while she some awesome , it is painfully obvious she is . The Kelly role also been toned down , as he is more of a silent bad ass than an obnoxious one . Overall , though , I must say it is NOT a movie , as many people in the audience in my theater thought . As it turns out , half the with in the theater left after the first 20 , because Billy Bob at least one or two of profanity in every sentence ( just no f - ). Same with many of the , especially and Tanner , but really it almost like an R movie that was simply reworked to fit to maintain the - 13 rating . But my lord , was it funny ...",0
"A poetic observation of how people struggle to connect with one another in an isolating and contemporary world : that  s how the blurb this movie . herself , an aspiring artist of the conceptual sort -- and a lonely single woman . She becomes fascinated by a shoe salesman , ( ), a father of two young who  s just from his wife .  s day job , though she only one known customer , is Elder Cab , a one - person driving service for old people .

They seem to have slid through this playful metaphor into dating , but . comes back and in his car but he her to get out . The moment is to pass and the charm , already shaky , . As too often nowadays , this scene came through best in the of the trailer . There  s some amusing satire of the art gallery world and the have to go through to enter it .  s acceptance by a haughty lady on the basis of a goofy monologue a bit far fetched . But then real life is a lot stranger and often more compelling than anything in this movie . and finally do date , and to exhibit a gallery piece that the man  s late .

The are well cast and often droll .  s two glum are sly and appealing . . herself familiar , like somebody we know -- or more likely somebody we know from an inde film . But a serious weakness is that Deadwood actor and lack sex appeal or chemistry and their romance mechanical . Perhaps some of the are meant to capture a child  s ballooning sense of time , but there  s no energy to the from the adult point of view . In fact  Me and You  is ultimately a somewhat nondescript product of the inde film factory . It  s neither plot driven nor character driven . The and their are never to just take over and flow . It to survive on its quirkiness but that  t enough because there  s no passion behind it . It  s too arch and self conscious . It not to entertain or absorb but to be cute , and that  s a quality that in the absence of cute or cute people , eventually up .

"I thought I was going to see THE movie of the year . Must have been a bad year . Aside from the factual of the portrayal of a woman , the stereotypical  white trash  family , the boxing , and the ridiculous  Danger  character , it was . In the end , the movie to be a cheap political statement , and a terrible message in the process . I was from the down at age 18 . I  m not on a ventilator as Swank  s character is , but I am totally dependent on for feeding , dressing , . This movie just the myth that sustaining such an injury to a meaningless life . Swank can choose between school and death , and she death . Thank you for setting the disabled community back a few more . What have I done differently ? I  gone to college , lived on my own , and work as a journalist in the community . Where is the story about someone like me ? Why does every disabled person in a movie have to be a in a joke or depressed and angry ? For the record , my about the message don  t have any bearing on my about the quality of the film . It just  t that great . My opinion is the only reason it received such acclaim is a ) Clint , and b ) it with a controversial subject . We know to wax on political . If you watch this movie , please realize that the depiction of Swank as a is poorly . Hit me up if you want to know what it is really like .",1
"Watching this movie me of the Peter movie  Being There . To say you this film would be like the of  Being There  thinking the gardener , Chance , was a political or social genius - you would be looking for something that  t there . The in this film are all pathetic , the are put in awful , the plot was slow to say the least , some of the acting was and there were a couple of amusing but nothing that would make this movie worth seeing . If you are at all curious , wait for it to come out on and watch it one evening when you absolutely can  t think of anything else to do . There is nothing touching or sensitive about this film . This is the first time I have felt so to make a comment about a movie . I wasted my time and money ; don  t waste yours !",0
"Before seeing this film , I really  t know what to expect . I had never seen a clip or anything of that nature to hint to some sort of plot sequence or the like . A friend  s nomination was the only driving force that i had to see this film . Upon the final scroll I found myself in a cornucopia of , relentless in the mere fact that such a great film had gone unnoticed . I honestly to clap after seeing what had gone on and how everything came together . There are one or two in this film however , but I will leave you to decide if my interpretation of that is truly what it is . I don  t want to mention what place in the film so as not to give away any plot but trust me , this is not a film that should be . This gone , in my mind , from relative obscurity to my top 10 of all time list . Id say right under  The Last Samurai . 1 ) A Beautiful Mind 2 ) The Last Samurai 3 ) Crash 4 ) History X 5 ) The Matrix 6 ) out these",0
"This film is better for a night at study rather than a night at the . Not only is the plot a brow - beaten , it is virtually unrealistic . The idea that a woman would console a man who threw her out of her own house , had an extra - marital affair that in two , and left her completely broke is simply ridiculous . While the movie zealously religious virtue , it completely to capture the reality of human nature . This movie may have been successful with some , but I wholeheartedly dismiss it . Diary of a Mad Black Woman is merely an assemblage of , run - of - the - mill story into one lackluster film . Its mediocre , constant use of poetic justice and religious are much too weak . Perry just should have left this one on the stage .",1
"While many and other to have been disappointed by the Land of the Dead , I admire Romero for not his and making a fresh film within the genre . I would imagine that there was a lot of pressure from the to rehash . Instead , Romero made a very different movie - a biting satire of today  s world - with some good gore thrown in . The movie itself is a little uneven . Sadly , the last third is very hurried - as though it was harshly to fit the 90 min time frame . The in the movie are also much less edgy and unpredictable than the in the - and the film is less character - driven and more plot - driven than its . None of the are as memorable as the numerous from the first three . Moreover , there are a lot of and the plot a lot of scope so the movie could easily have filled a compelling 120 - 130 . On the other hand , the plot is much more important this time around and is as good as ever . Romero is on the  winner all  nature of world and of the post 9 / 11 world . Some that I are on the class system ( Fiddler  s Green ), the middle class yearning to be included in the upper class and its (  s fate ), immigration ( the island and its barbed ), the shock and awe campaign ( the , killing of the zombie ), the many obvious to the War on Terror ( , Dead Reckoning ), . I really watching the film , especially after I got over my subconscious of a rehash . Once I that it was a new film and not a remake , I saw the film in a new light . After all , it is very rare to see an film these days that any sort of social or political subtext . I sincerely hope Romero more to make such in the future - with or without and to red meat .",0
"I think ( strange but I do ) this movie is a good movie for its realism , and it  s not really a movie which you could put the  s brand on , because something been ( the of a legendary  National Treasure ), but a real rough situation , where mostly everyone of us in life , even unconsciously . I believe this is a good movie . But I don  t think is helpful in any . It may tell us how a simple and mostly lonely man can deal with the decision . But after that anyone of us may just get out of the theater not to go through anything like that . That is the defeat of our era . Probably been so great in out this fat worm in our shiny apple . Because the who come out of the theater thinking the movie had a serene ( maybe melancholy but serene ) ending , probably  t get there is tragic situation in the end , a continuous remorse which will always knock on everyone  s door , and the only question is  how can we prevent it ? I don  t know if people to question about themselves , probably He just to show us in reality there are some really uneasy human case .",1
"We never really get to know the boxer in this film , she remains to the end a one - dimensional caricature and  s character was entirely unlikeable throughout . Freeman  s narration was too eerily similar to Redemption and to have no real importance to the overall story , along with the rest of the gym  s boring . Although Swank does a good job with the material she is given , her dialogue never to transcend  oh golly gee boss . She is a great actress and was in Don  t Cry , but in this - she was cardboard . What was her attraction to boxing and to ? Who . Who . Apparently , that was incidental to the story . Evil , stupid White Trash , a saintly janitor , and a boxer that to the top in 1 year with barely any training - where have we seen this all before ? This is a pro euthanasia movie that  t even make an attempt to show the other side . The character unilaterally the law into his own without due process or legal recourse and the boxer . Sickening and not a good message after the debacle . I wonder how much of the for this movie is out of political motivation for its seedy message . The unrealistic boxing , the grating narration , the nasty priest , the meaningless , and the hackneyed that the film seem in the end to have all been mere plot to depict how wonderful euthanasia is . If that is the case , shame on you Clint . Clint great talent and his Mystic River was an excellent movie but he can  t seem to get past his Dirty Harry persona . I  seen enough of it already but apparently most people haven  t by the undeserved this film . This is the most over - mediocrity since Beauty . 20 from now it will be entirely forgotten .",0
"This movie is so bad it is actually entertaining . I gave it a 2 rather that a 1 because it is amusing . The  Airplane  are supposed to be based on this and I can see why . I won  t make any about the cardboard , corny , and painfully unreal , as it been said better elsewhere in these . I  just give you a challenge : Watch  The High and the Mighty  after you watch  Airplane  and try not to laugh . Some Box Office wear well over time . Unfortunately , this is not one of them .",0
"I saw this movie ago ( I think it was on in 1979 when ) and the only thing I was when Stack . Sadly , it  t up . And this film being one of the for  Airplane   t help - I kept laughing at dialogue that  t supposed to be funny ! Yes , the film score is memorable and the movie is beautifully shot , but this is one of cardboard , together with and unintentionally hilarious voice - ( Stack  s rambling inner monologue you wonder what he  s been smoking ). There is , however , one really good moment - Sterling  s   scene . That was very well done , and Sterling really my attention . Would that the rest of the movie had been as good . I also the 50s depiction of air travel - men in , in jewelry and everybody . But that  s about all I can recommend . Sorry , .",1

"First I would like to disagree that an actor  s true age to that of the role they take on . If someone is 18 , legal age to be to display adult circumstance and and 13 doing it , then that is more effect than someone who is a minor a minor role simply because reality is not federally regulated the way film is , ( child sex still goes , on , although you can  t show sex in a movie .) Hence   now that  s a movie worth it , and they  t  Look old doing it . As for the writing , I  t that , a lot of were thrown at you which  t be together with the main plot , what relation is Brook to , does Mel  s have anything to do with main plot , and to me , how is such a bad influence to when ( in the movie sequence ) it like was doing it all to herself ( rude to her mother , close ...) maybe they the wrong explaining  s role in that !!! i was disappointed at the end too , i believe Holly should have been given more to work with , more , bigger . as for ,  Wow ... like no one would  that she not only wrote it , but wrote herself in as the most popular , girl in school , ( chuckle , chuckle ,) typical !!!! it would be a lot more interesting if she were to give up that to someone who is more convincing , and good looking . oh yeah , of stunk for that reason too , don  t think she was worth any",0
"I went into the movie with high given its rating . However , the movie to be satisfied skipping along the surface of its theme of racism without ever exploring it . It simply a sequence of racist face to face with other racist . It did that masterfully , but there was no coherent message in it all . Some undergo VERY cheesy , the rest though stay pretty much exactly the same . Bullock  s role in the movie was so pathetically one - dimensional it  s a wonder it  t cut . Don  s role was pretty much entirely irrelevant ... he nothing to the movie except a sad - looking , pensive face the entire time .",0
"We watched this with our 6 and 7 year old thinking it was a great movie . We should have a bit more . Most of the movie they were gasping ( both can read ) at the swear .

After Shark Tale and now we  re pretty much giving up on if one more is with this kind of crap in it . Really , do they need to show the word HELL behind the lion when he  s feeling bad ? We know he  s feeling bad , he sad . Keep it simple , and all of us with will be back again and again . We spend BIG at to keep our happy . Don  t miss out on it because you have to be a  cool guy company . Keep up the garbage mouthing , and we  leave you cold .",1
"Finally , a movie about human evil that  t involve the Holocaust , slavery , , or ! There were two of depravity in the film - the and the apathetic world that stood by and did nothing knowing full well what was happening . The movie some memorable acting . Don was marvelous and thoroughly believable as a dignified man of strength that had to juggle the of protecting his family , his hotel , his people , and his identity . , who his wife , was equally superb as was Nick in a limited role as UN that really his job seriously . Second , the movie was thoroughly riveting from beginning to end and to maintain the suspense throughout - we never really knew how this was going to end for the family and yet we really and hoped for the best against all odds . There was a moment in the film in which I cried but whether it was because of the horror the experienced or because of the depravity latent in the heart of all mankind , I do not know . There are two which will stick with you . First , the memory of the bombastic radio speaker the to  cut the tall down  is a angry voice of intense evil . Second , the memory of the unwitting  friend  that spoke so callously about completely all . When indignantly something like  surely you can  t think you can kill all of them , he  Why not ? We are half way there already ! Chilling , just chilling . Great film and it is just too darn bad that a pile of politically - correct mediocrity like Million Dollar Baby can win over outstanding like Hotel and Ray .",1
"I really mean it . The story of the Great is an interesting one to be told . Also , I tend to like from the antiquity . My movie ,  The Gladiator , got me into it . Even though  Troy  disappointed me , I still had for this one , but it to be worse in every aspect . Where  Troy  still was a mediocre movie ,   on every level . First of all , the action - in like this are important . I don  t know exactly what it was , but the action in this movie  t excite me one bit . It was rather dull and uninteresting . One scene in is rather , but that  s it . The story is also VERY boring . I know that this is a true story and all , but it actually is possible to make it more exciting . And what about the  be with - considering ? That should  been completely removed from the movie . I fully understand that this movie was in .

"This film had it  s good and bad . On one hand , the plot was predictable , the not particularly funny and the speed of the movement gave me a headache ( they constantly run around and jump and dance ). I did like the , although they  t anything new or interesting . ( as the giraffe ) made me laugh , but mainly because I could compare the personality of the giraffe to that of  s character Ross in the show - both a bit paranoid and very cautious at all times . G ( as the lemur king ) made me giggle as well when he , and I particularly the  wackiness  of his character . The were probably the most enjoyable on the film - they were  psychotic  ( as the lion to call them ) and I found them very entertaining to watch . The animation in this film was very well done . I in particular the perfection on the water effects ( by the sea in or in  s swimming pool ) and  s mane ( how it when he does ). I would say this film is enjoyable . It  t anything new or fantastic , but it did have small where it made you smile or laugh . Otherwise it got a bit predictable really . My advice - see if you . But don  t expect too much - the make it look better than it is !",1
"I have been about and the Third since High School and have read everything I could get my on . I have also traveled to visit the shown in the movie . I also read a review in the which said the lead actor had and practiced  s accent . Usually when you watch about history , the want to make the movie interesting not accurate . The first thing I look for is the accuracy of the equipment and and I was most . I found out later the movie company had excellent technical advisor  s . What really left a profound impression on me was how some of the people in the movie would prefer death over surrender . The idea of loyalty , honor , and duty to country was outstanding -- like the motto of the ,  My Honor is Loyalty  or a motto like ,  Death before Dishonor . I was so by this that I to climb into the screen and go back in time to be able to be with people like this . I really wished I was back in the Third Reach !",0
"Yes this is the best of the three . The special effects are as as ever and this time there is more story . The problem however , is the major plot .

I  other people say that in the new of Star , out this . I don  t know if that  s true but if it is , its a lazy attempt to tie the original story together .

Luke and have a passionate kiss in Empire back and then we learn that they are brother and sister . this fact by saying  somehow .... I  always known .

"The preview I saw of The Hitchhiker  s Guide to the Galaxy almost nothing about the movie itself . In this way they unintentionally acknowledged that it is hard to translate the and radio to the big screen . But it would also immediately make clear that this is one of the worst ever made . As the are unconventional in form and content , a conventional movie was no option . So they had to place this somewhere else in the movie universe . Instead of different , which could have worked , they rely mostly on absurd humor to you with an anarchistic tone . The movie is quintessential , but this is not Python at work . The are helpless and clumsy here with the material ; the director  t have a visual clue where it  s going and works by the . There are several ( intended ?) continuity . It cheap production , laughable and an irritating . The first cartoon intermezzo was somewhat funny , but they become so repetitious ( like many in the movie ) that you lose interest soon . A opportunity is also that further of the to living on earth would extend beyond the as and as religious leader . One plus is the funny beginning , when earth is for a galactic highway whereas Dent  s home is also under threat from a highway on earth . And when a back - up earth is made there are some funny like filling the ocean with water . It the audience was totally forgotten when making this . To sit through this is torture . Half the cinema was empty at the end . You can  t say I haven  t you .",1
"My were high for this 4th Crow feature , as I had been it  s progress for almost 2 prior to it  s release . What a waste of 2 . The Crow : Wicked Prayer is a poor quality b - grade movie bordering on c - grade . The direction is poor and the casting is weak . As always Tara over to the point of ridiculousness ( that  s what Tara does best ) and Furlong  t have the clue about the torment behind his character . is hugely miscast as a Satanic Cult Leader but does the best with what he to work with . As been the case in the past 10 , Hopper another and pathetic cameo performance trying to revive his  Cool Man ! style which made him famous . I fear it is too late for The Crow franchise to pick itself up . The first two in the series have an artistic , neo - richness to them but the last two in the series look made for at best . I appreciate that they to change the formula somewhat by moving it  s location to the dessert and it mostly by day light ... but they . I am not a prude by any , but there was way too much unnecessary course language coming from who  t deliver the with conviction . Perhaps if they decide for one more attempt , they should consider a more established director and return to a dark atmosphere . Perhaps also the Crow be a female !? Whatever the case , The Crow : Wicked Prayer a cool name but the rest is tripe . Worth from a bargain bin for those intent on the complete collection of Crow .",0

Crash  all the of a great movie . Great cast , great acting , great dialogue , believable and , impressive cinematography , and a good director . But it just  t quite  gel  with me . It like it was just a series of with barely and story , with a bunch of racist to speak a message that  s never quite clear . Most of the were themselves , nobody * really * themselves even though the made it seem like many of them did , there was never any closure in the majority of the , and everything was just a bit too coincidental to seem as realistic as the movie was supposed to be . All of the would show up again to affect another character in the story , which would then affect another character . For a movie that  s supposed to portray gritty realism , I certainly found myself thinking  What an unlikely coincidence  very often whenever a character would show up again later on for a dramatic third - act plot twist . I think a series with maybe one character  s back story on per episode ( for example , the same format as  s  Lost ) would  worked better . But there really was never a full , coherent story in this movie , nor was there ever a clear message . It just like they to pack way too much into two , and for me , it fell a little flat . Definitely worth seeing for the fantastic ( I never knew   could act , Don is excellent , and even me ). But to me , it  s a movie with a near - perfect body , but no real soul .",0
"I saw this flick at San Comic Con 2005 and it . The movie had a comic book look and feel that I . It is very good short for of the  battle suit  anime like Mobile Suit . The art was well done : the facial of the are well done as are the . The attention to detail in the animation is very good , you can see the detail of frayed in the main character  s jeans and the of his hair . As for the plot , they a lot into a short amount of time . In the 10 minute run time , you will see , a young boy  s discovery of a battle suit , relentless , and a little childhood romance . I highly recommend this short !",1
"Is . Everyone Romero a master . Ahem . Even his biggest admit that the majority of his are crap . His Zombie are by far his best , but are weighed down with social commentary so blatant it as if you  re in the face with a wet salmon of political justice . Anyway , onto the film . Land of the Dead is a pretty fun little flick , without too much going on to overload your brain . It in comparison to the Dawn of the Dead Remake , and even of the Dead ( which admired Romero so much ). The action is barely action . There is a lot of movement , but you  re never really by it . There are a few clever in between fairly lame . The acting  t bad . Hopper is awesome as usual , and he every frame he is in . The special effects are good and its nice to see on the big screen . Overall this is a decent flick , if you  re a fan of the genre I  m sure you  like it , but if you  re not a huge Romero or Zombie fan , you wont really be that excited by it . I  m a huge zombie fan , and this a 7 .",1
"Suffering from severe flu I did not care what was on the last night . Finding Neverland was a movie I knew little about and only the fact that two of my , and , starred in it led me to have any interest . Of course I knew well the Story of Peter Pan and had read the book myself and to my own . But of J . M . I knew almost nothing . After the first fifteen to twenty that it took me to settle into the world of Barry comfortably , learn that he had a accent , accept that he slipped between the real and imaginary with ease , and I was transported to another place . A gentle world that brought back to me my own childhood and of fancy . I am no expert just a lover of and watch as many as I can . I cant remember a better film , a better performance than and the young boy who Peter . How on earth could a young child have the insight and intensity to convey what he did . Truly an amazing performance . No violence no sex no bad language . Wonderful and , finely written dialogue brilliant acting in the minor . I have no . It just got better and better . As for the last half an hour . I had stopped for the first time in two days as I watched spellbound , but the that as I felt so many tender and sad and wonderful nearly me . Don  t miss this film . Stay with it for the first 15 to 20 and let yourself relax into a time and the world of Never land . I  m going to watch it again today , and tomorrow ....",1
"I admit to being a Mike fan . There  s been some great stuff . I  Wit  and  The Graduate  and even  Primary Colors . There  s been some great and story - telling going on for just a little over 30 from this guy , which me to the question : why this movie ? Why  Closer ? I can  t imagine wanting to spend time making a movie about a bunch of people who are unpleasant , deceptive , and just down right mean . Even though the bulk of his work is about people you  t normally like , at least his past provide some kind of redemption for themselves . They  re not just unpleasant , deceptive and mean to each other ; they do this to themselves . For example , if you were Clive  s character and you were in love with your wife , would you have sex with a prostitute while you were away on vacation ? And then would you expect her to stay after you  ? And even more , would you expect that you  d end up in the end ? How  bout Law  s character ? Every time he a woman that  s , younger , and more out of his reach , he goes for her ... even if he  s seeing someone else . When he , he  s living with Ruby . When he Anna , he  s living with . He  s not just unhappy with these that he with , but he is apparently unhappy with himself . Oh , and how   that he to write . A bit for my taste . He was boring , unsettling , and worthless as a character . Then there  s Anna . I imagine that  t have to do too much prep work for this role because she was already used to stealing people  s in real life . This one came naturally to her which the question how come she was such a bad actress in this film ? I  m glad Cate backed out and left this crummy role to a crummy over - rated actress . The best thing she can do is smile that  epic  smile and look as the go by . Her character is not just boring , mean , and deceptive but also disgusting . Although Clive  s character was a total jerk , he had it right at the end when he said that total keep looking for depression . Of course , that only the question why he would want her back if she will inevitably leave him again for something less happy ? Or is that the point ? Either way , I would have her , screwed her , and left her at the end . Not dump her , screw her , and then take her back .  t the best reward for her be to leave her if that  s what she really ? It sure would save you a lot of trouble if you just got rid of her before she did it to you . At least you could go out on a good note and not be the one who . And finally , how about ? Or Jane . Or whoever . If this movie was supposed to make me think chameleon or changeling , it  t . It made me think that this is a highly movie that is trying to program the audience to believe that failure and deception is acceptable . This whole movie is an Spelling plot from 90210 because everyone with each other , each other , and themselves after all is said and done . I admit to reading a summary on half way through the movie that made me want to finish it . It said something along the of  wait until you see the end ; you  never see that coming . So I watched and watched and watched and when the rolled , I was still waiting for this magnificent ending . So what ? So she goes back to New York , a failure from who was a failure already from New York , long hair , a little , maybe a little wiser , and down the street like a . I guess we  re supposed to think she is like a well - weathered sage , a been - there - done - that gal who is really self confident and been hurt so - don  t - mess - with - me - if - you  re - - play - mind - . I mean , really . Overall , I gave this movie a 5 because of Clive . He  s fresh enough in the market so that you haven  t ( yet ) seen this character and meaner than everyone else in a very subversive way that you hope you never meet someone like him . Other than that , you can skip the rest .",1
"I am a Crow fan and after seeing the , just like most of you , I knew NOT to expect much out of this . Although I must say this is a MUCH better effort than the last 2 . I DO believe that there will never be another Crow movie to even compare to the first , but IF they decide to make good , then I think they should , but if they are just sit around and count on Crow like me to buy every movie regardless , then maybe they just retire while they  re ahead . Unlike the other 2 I only have a few about this one : 1 . I have to agree about the Hopper , although I am a fan of him ,  t really feel right in this movie , I can  t really determine why , I just know I was sitting there thinking , Why are you here ? 2 . Tara , enough said 3 . Once again , it is almost the same story , although a good one , still the same , I would like to see a more innovative come out of future , if there will be any . I understand that The Crow to be one of the to expand upon , but if you can  t do it , then just don  t make the movie . There were a lot of good though , but i  m not make a list , what I really want to get across is this though ... FINALLY SOMEONE ( other than Lee ) THE CROW LIKE THEY ACTUALLY TO BE / ABOUT THE CHARACTER . At first I was unsure if Furlong was be up to this , but now , I think he come the since Lee , which is definitely good news , this was a rare occasion was I was happy to be proved wrong . Also , even though I said early that the story too , even though it it definitely is the best rehash , thus far . Overall though , I must say that if you have been burnt by the last 2 , like us all , just give this one a try , at least in this one there is an EFFORT , to make it good , it  t even come close to the first but BY FAR is the second best of this series ........

"is as heavily homosexual in this movie , somewhat the image of him as a great warrior . Many thematic evidence a flamboyance that from the general mood , generating that don  t match . Such as the helmet that a closer resemblance to a head dress than a piece of armor , and music that was more fitting for a frolic in the , than for a conqueror victorious . The bizarre twist of feminine beauty that is to such a bloody and ugly thing as war , bloodshed , and dismemberment the movie seem heterogeneous , and many from the musical score and to the camera work seem out of place . I have never the perception of as gay in any of my with history , and for such an opinion to erect itself so suddenly me to question its historical accuracy .",1

"t seem to know the word moderation . His over the past ten or so have either of  s like the Spy series or violent like the saga . The idea of an  M  rated movie abhorrent . Which us nicely to his latest venture - an adaptation of Frank Miller  s graphic novel series Sin City . This is not a movie for everybody  s taste ; and although the MA15 + may suggest that already , I find it hard to believe that this got away with a rating than Kill Bill Vol . 1 after what some of the go through . This is not the sort of violence that made Kill Bill so wild and stylish , rather , Miller and ( as a  guest director  ) show a much more and world of violence that is dominated in black in white , with only the odd emphasis of colour . The plot is actually 3 - all loosely connected with one another . in the first one as - a cop whose early retirement are cut short due to a combination of his own with justice and his partner Bob ( ); only to find his obsession later on all grown up in the form of Alba and his still alive in the form of what can only be as something seen to be . in the second story - a convict who is determined to get to the bottom of who a hooker that spent the night with him . This perhaps one of the most interesting of the movie in the form of Wood , who after , - a cannibalistic stalker . Finally ( as if two  t enough ) there  s ( Clive ) who to help protect the   of Old Town led by Gale ( Rosario ) from the mob and bent . All the cast of Sin City really come to the fore , with and in particular standing out and making the gritty neo - 30  s gangster come to life . The environment is fantastic and one can only applaud for the time he taken to recreate the atmosphere of Miller  s . As I said before , Sin City is not for everyone - but if you can handle violence ( and I mean violence ) then this is a movie not to be .",1
"Let me start off with saying I am not a Romero fan . I have seen Night Of The Living Dead and Dawn Of The Dead . I will check out Day Of .. too . I have to say I this one . I have that have been since way back and they were disappointed with it . To me this is a new era and it was nearly 20 since the last dead movie . I that it was more gory and violent than the old . The better than ever , the were but the action was fun . I don  t know what people but this is it . I the sense of humor with the political about the current state of the world tied into it . My only beef is the timing with release and its the fault . Why are they horror in the summer ? They just had and before this one . To me this should have been a fall / winter release . It was not going to be Star or Fantastic Four . The other thing was making it a bit longer . I usually don  t feel that way but it could of been and it would not hurt . Possibly there may be another one coming out depending on the success . If you can see it in the theater , see it .",1
"The story of a white trash early 30s woman ( Swank ) determined to be a good boxer and the veteran coach ( ) who reluctantly her on board . The tale is by  s gym buddy Freeman .

Swank  s lack of a father figure in her life , and her clearly trashy family her relationship with whose own daughter is from him all the more relevant .

"A truly horrific experience .  The Day After Tomorrow  from the pop - culture school of action - adventure , where the world is again and again by a splashy screen saver . start out , as these do , with a guilty father . This particular father is guilty because he  t spend a lot of time with his son . Don  t too much on this though , because the movie  t . You can substitute basically any reason for a father to feel guilty in any picture in the past 15 without consequence . It turns out that the guilty father is a scientist .

But no one will believe him , especially -- are you ready for this -- a vice president who to look * exactly * like Dick . Not - Dick - it would be too costly to fight global warming . This is what is  dramatic irony , when the audience know something the character  s don  t . In this case , we know that production company spent of millions of on effects , but not - Dick - is in the dark . Meanwhile the guilt - causing - son to New York for no reason other than the intend to destroy it . Several obligatory are here , the going - to - be - - shortly - after - major - cataclysmic - event . This is about when the screen saver turns on . and are . The process of elimination leaves only New York , which its comeuppance in the form of a stealth tidal wave . Leaving the science behind how a 40 + foot tidal wave New York and there for 11 days aside , let us consider that the New York metropolitan area more people per square mile than any city in the U .

But nature a surprise for us : this is the world  s first acidic tidal wave , dissolving every dead body it comes in contact with . It is shortly after by acidic snow . So everything cold -- real cold , but , like , it can  t come in unless you invite it . Somewhere in here as well we have the attempt to add drama in a major motion picture for 2004 , when some show up to much the guilt - causing son . There  s also some bit about the guilty father through the snow to reach his son in New York . His motivation : he  s guilty and he  to do this . Eventually it all . Guilty dad up not five before rescue do , making his entire journey less than pointless . I guess it was about  proving yourself . We  re assured that everything is because even though 2 billion people are dead , the guilty - father and his family made it through , the son got himself a , and there are no more screen in the budget . In all of this , I left out the smarmy about a with cancer and an ultra corny series , probably for by the White House , in which the president is the last person to evacuate the danger zone . It  s funny stuff , and a good shot in the arm for anyone who the  liberal  mantra last seen screeching from Ann  s . In total , this movie is terrible . Even for a disaster film .

"# 1 Best Film of 1968It  s been thirty - seven , but whenever I hear  Also  by on the radio , in a commercial , on television or in a movie , I always think of the illustrious motion picture ,  2001 : A Space . It was a film surrounding space travel and life in space in the future by one of the world  s most celebrated , .  2001  was  s first big - budget film , his most memorable film and many film and movie alike agree it  s his most genius work . Part of the reason why  2001  was such a hit was because of the amazing special effects ( for the time - it was 1968 ) and the and brooding classical music score that blended perfectly into the peace and quiet of outer space . While with its spectacular visual effects ,  2001  also their intelligence and view on human life with deep philosophical and lodged deep inside science - fiction picture . People have  2001 : A Space  as being the work of an extraordinarily gifted ahead of his time , and other have it as being , , deliberately and very undeserving of it  s praise . I have finally one of cinema  s most about and over , and I can assure you it  s not only an excellent movie , it  s one of the best made motion of all time , thanks entirely to the very meticulous and conscientious vision of , the film director to ever grace the world . 2001 : A Space  is set in the beautiful and peaceful of outer space , where ( mostly and ) do astrological research from expansive . A lot of what we have today ( and what we had when the book  2001  is based upon was written ) now been with artificial intelligence ( ) in  s of what the year 2001 would look like , taken of course from  s and controversial novel . The story two on a mission up in space , . Bowman ( ) and . Frank ( ). Their mission is them to the moon , to find an artificial relic , which can lead to the discovery to a new and mysterious life form . The two are by H . A . L ., the creepy - voiced computer of the , who a mind of it  s own and eventually turns on them . H . A . L . turns on the two when he ( it , really ) to save them in fear it will jeopardize their mission . The film becomes a sort - of survival story after that for ( Frank , when he is to be saved by H . A . L .) which eventually him to what the mission is looking for , taking him on a five minute journey filled with vibrant and e colors and graphics through the of outer space , eventually resulting in seeing himself aging and eventually dying , and being re - born as a extra - terrestrial . 2001  s ending may be one of the most about , and about film of all time . There is no solid explanation for it , and . ( as well as author ) leave it up to you ( the viewer ) to figure out . I personally found the ending to be extremely and mind - numbing the first time I saw it . I just  t grasp it , until about four days later I to deeply admire it . In my opinion ,  2001  is very anti - technology ( it will one day destroy us ), but hope for us in the future . the absolute best direction of his career with  2001 : A Space  that it is nothing short of appalling he  t receive the for  Best Director . Without , there  t have been a movie of  2001 , period . Only his rich , elaborate , sophisticated and undeniably gorgeous could make  2001  what it is then and today . In other , if any other was to touch it , the project would crash and burn . the movie with aching beauty ever second of the , not only with the direction but the screenplay he - wrote with the famous novel  s author , C . . The acting in  2001  is really nothing special , but it  t have to be because the last thing  2001  is about is the . , , Sylvester , and Rain ( who the chilling voice of the vengeful computer , H . A . L .) are all decent , but nothing really memorable ( well , just Rain  s voice ). The film by being a tad overlong , and it  s also very slow moving in the beginning , but I forgive it for that . The film  s cinematography , visual effects , musical score , set decoration , screenplay and sound were all Academy Award worthy , and in my opinion  2001  should have taken home the for  Best Motion Picture of the Year , but it  t even nominated . If that  t prove to you how short - sighted and ignorant the Academy are , I don  t know what will ! In conclusion , I don  t even recommend  2001 . I plead , no I demand , you dash to your local and rent a copy . You may enjoy it , you may not , but you will definitely be thinking about it the next morning and it will for sure enlighten you .  2001   t as much of a film as it is a landmark in cinema .  2001  set the bar for many extraordinary motion to come , and I  say it again , none of it would be possible without the genius of . . If you  already seen it , I recommend you buy it on , along with  s other in his Collection his work from 1962 to 1999 .  2001  may bore you a little , but when it  s all over it will give you a slightly different view on .

You would think that it would at least have a good ending but it  t . just say that I don  t plan on this movie to my collection . Again ... don  t recommend it to anyone unless you have like 10 and about 2 you want to waste at you local movie theater . I don  t think it should be worth time .

"I saw a special screening tonight in , where the director and afterward . As a major history and especially buff , I was excited and happy to gain to the event . But I ended up leaving the theater with a feeling of being disappointed . The were decent , but several obviously the part ( s ) not through talent , but for the way that they / . The first 2 / 3 of the movie is slow , with far too much emphasis on a love story than should have been included . The battle are wonderfully done , with great graphics and special effects . But the love story woven in a lot of the movie , and attention off of the true story and , sort of like Pearl Harbor .

( And all four were prominently displayed during the cast interview .) I  d avoid plot for those who haven  t seen it , but the plot is so , thin and predictable , I can  t offer . The only change to the old poor - boy - - good - boxing formula is that it  s a poor girl this time . Swank is pretty good and the boxing are fairly well , but neither are good enough to rescue the movie from dreary predictability . The direction is marginally competent in , and I even think I spotted Clint act at one point . Otherwise , his caricature of a bitter old grouch was simplistic and one - dimensional . But neither Swank  s , nor Morgan Freeman  s characteristic likability , could save the movie from a premise that is such a tired old that I  m anyone with it . It  s a politically - correct Rocky rehash . Apparently , it made everyone who read the script cry , so that making it . Well , I cried during The Champ . But that was 30 ago . This was pure self - indulgence on the part of Clint . The grand question that at his soul was the cherry on top .  Look how strong and moral and basically good I am ! It was shot in 37 days . That . Even the screenwriter said he was that his first draft was shot . He  t have done that , and he would have been right not to . There were a loose all over the place , implausible ( you  d think in the hospital ward would have been an issue ), and a lot of stock that could have done with some disguise . And how about that guy talking to , Swank and Freeman on the cast interview afterwards ? I  d be embarrassed to be by such a fawning fool .  I know I  t say  genius , but * sigh * GENIUS * faint *. It was creepy . Swank made the only contribution , both in her effort in the role , and in afterwards that the movie did something for female . It  s not all just crude trailer - trash violence , and some of these deserve a bit of respect - and self - respect . But other than that , it was a load of . A waste of money . I give it three out of ten , as a consolation prize to Swank . Clint - of whom , incidentally , I  m a big fan - .",0
"Everything about this movie is extremely average and the movie  t feature one thing that  t been done before . Its extremely formulaic simple entertainment with a way too simple story and uninteresting . Where did it went wrong ? Simple , it went wrong from the moment they hired W . S . . He  t made ONE movie in his career that is interesting , original or simply above average . This movie really is no exception . It a typical style , meaning that it  s filled with . But is even worser as a writer , the story he wrote for this movie is incredibly simple and awful and dull .  s is truly the thing of the movie . His of the , with as a result that the don  t have an awful lot to do in this movie and their come across as bad . Even Lance  s role . Also the of the action are seriously . Although some of the action does its , it is badly and horribly . Halve of the time I  t even exactly tell what was happening . The are completely uninteresting and of some you don  t even get to know their . Why should you even care for the in this movie ? None of them is likable or easy to relate with . Also what was with the many in this movie ? It was quite irritating to be honest . But even worse were some of the that the and were making . The made the of and the that of . It made me seriously laugh when I the queen alien trumpet . So down for the sound department as well . The movie is not as bad as I make it sound now maybe but it  s just that this was a movie with so much potential but somehow turned it into the most formulaic and average movie possible . I mean when you have to concept of making the fight the , then surely there is something better they could had come up with . The movie is slightly below average because of the extremely simple and uninteresting story and . Still the special effects are good and some of the action is enjoyable enough to make this movie still a watchable one . 5 / 10http :// bobafett1138 . . /",0
"Over the , like most people , I have seem them all , but , without question , this is the best horror film I have ever seen . I have never an audience react in the way in which they did when I watched this on the big screen . My was physically shaking when we left . Its completely superb from beginning to end and I echo the please have made about going to watch this at the cinema , rather than wait for it to come onto . Its quite simply SUPERB and if you like being you will love it . I went caving very recently for the first time and how the dark and very confined can play on your . like The Ring , Grudge , and Saw to name a few  t in the same league as this . See it , you will not regret it .",0
"The last few have seen many excellent ranging from historical , as in The Emperor and the Assassin , to brilliant action , Hero , House of Flying Daggers , like Soccer , like infernal and more . Kung Fu Hustle is the next step of what I consider the growing up of the Film Industry . Gong Fu is an action film full of some of the martial you can find . But it does not stop there . Latest and cinematic effects are with ease to make the experience truly magnificent . This part could describe a well made but typical action production . But Gong Fu beyond that , very satirical that make this movie a treat . If you are a fan of Kung Fu or if you are a critic , this film can entice both as it a delectable parody of the genre without taking itself too seriously . In so far it what lost somewhere along the way , the ability to make a funny and inventive movie that is filled with little thoughtful to discover while still appealing to a broad public . There are , which are so that they become , when you can not believe what is happening on screen . Typical like bad synchronization so common in past are delightfully upon . In of the movie I was even of from Z and other anime . But underneath it all Gong Fu does not hide its social critique and the finger on several that might hurt if you think about them . Overall this is a movie for nearly everyone , providing and entertainment , if you just want to relax , and little and to contemplate , if you are of the thoughtful persuasion . In my opinion it is one of this top . !!!",1
"Upon this movie I have to say it left me totally . Why is pointless excessive violence so popular ?? This movie does not answer , but rather such . I am not a fan of violence . I cant see the point in doing ugly to each other . Prior to out this movie I did not that had a guest spot , otherwise even the opportunity to see Josh in action would not have me into the to sit through multiple of ( in my opinion ) seemingly endless and senseless butchery . I could appreciate the clever visual design and artistic styling of the movie - and lariat is stunning , but  How could you ?",1

Most of my have slept instead of watching it , you can take it instead of sleeping . , i think you really should put vote 0 ( zero ) - it  s the most appropriate for  sideways . What can you say about the cast ? Music ? Screenplay ? I think there must be some rating on the cover about that kind of - one five big  D  on the front . This is no joke , otherwise how can we be from that kind of junk ? I haven  t seen a movie so ugly since   pop - up . come on , we can count to three , come on now , some people even can count to ten . how bad level we can reach till bang the alarm ? STOP THIS",0
"This is the film that i had been waiting for . Rarely there ever been a film where i was out of my seat from the ball attitude of a film . Right from the first second of film I felt i would leave a happy person . The heavy black and white cinematography , the intense colour work , the awesome acting from everyone , every bit of this is flawless in my . Many have said this is against , but the whole time the were on I thought i  t want to mess with them . This is really for the . As they said , the are the law , and you  t want to cross them ; especially . All the are tough and forceful . going on a relentless massacre for a woman he is the best tragic love story i have every seen in film . But all the are tragic love in one way . A thought about the violence in Sin City . If this was in colour , the violence would have been so much more disturbing . Though this is a violent movie , it is very ; so the impact is down that your not always the violence . In all , this is  s best work . This film will never date and be as strong in 20 to 50 time .",1
"This film is wonderfully original and quirky . It is about , and struggling with the of modern life . All the appear lost and confused and life to happen to them rather than their taking initiative . All the seem to have coincidental that plot development . The interplay between and is in a warm manner without being sentimental . Innocence is neither lost or . The innocent appear only to be confused by the happening around them . This film to ask the question : What is the meaning of life ? And : We don  t have the idea .",1
"This is a wonderful movie . I can  t recommend it highly enough . You don  t have to be a fan of Peter Pan to enjoy it either . It  s just a great story with terrific period costume thrown in and a wonderful theme as well . It is certainly appropriate for some younger as there is no sex , no violence and lots of neat J . M .  s staged and inside his Imagination . It also with the issue of death in a very mature way without being maudlin at all and without , religious or otherwise -- and also without talking down to ( the have recently lost their father when the movie )",1
"This is such a great movie because it  s not about just boxing . It  s a father - daughter love story . You have an old trainer who  t have anybody - not even his . Then you have a the nobody who  s  t have any one either . You get so into this movie that you don  t feel like your watching a movie -- its all real . But not even the movie buff in the world  t have seen the ending coming . The boxing in the movie is great , but it  s that ending that you realize this  t like all the other -- it  s more , because it you rethink your and but at the same time  t tell you what to think .",1
"The Crow : Wicked Prayer boldly out of the box , and the series into a completely different direction , much fresh air to the series . By far , this is the best sequel . Story : Ex - con Jimmy and his Lily , are picked by Crash and his gang to be used in a ritual to make the Devil himself . Little does know , Jimmy is raised from the dead by the crow to seek revenge and stop the evil ceremony . Plagued with anger from his past , and grieving the loss of his love , Jimmy out to make the wrong right . The film several sub - , a feud between the and the White Men , and villain back . A different story , and I it . : Lance did a fantastic job with the severely limited budget that he had . The mood , , and setting was wonderful . There are some truly of scenery . My only complaint is how well lit everything was . great style , and I look forward to seeing some of his future work . I can only imagine what this guy could do with a decent budget . Acting : Here is where the movie . Furlong ( Jimmy ) the part of Jimmy well . There is a lot of anger in his performance , which I think the character quite well . I really felt for him , and his emotional have a real impact on the viewer . ( Crash ) really stole the show for 3 / 4 of the movie . He a bad guy well , and every line he had . His presence is amazing . However , in the last act , when he becomes Satan , he severely . Someone should have told him to calm down . Tara ( ) did surprisingly well . Usually she  s awful , in this , she  s just not that great . Overall , all the did an excellent job , the worst being . Score : composed an amazing score . The music in this film is my favorite , second only to the first . It you in , and you in the . Violence : The violence is pretty constant . However , it is either off - screen , or for the most part , bloodless . We get some down and dirty , , , light blood , a heart rip , and a somewhat juicy . Profanity / Sexual : The language is used throughout , and it quite vulgar . There is some light sexual content , though on nudity , or anything like that . Substance Abuse : There is a scene in which the get high off of peyote , but it is done in a very stylish way . Overall : The Crow : Wicked Prayer is by far the best of the . It is a rocking good time , with action , emotion , and passion . I really the flick . Worth a look for any fan boy , or someone looking for an action movie with heart . If only the budget  t been so tiny , the film could have totally blown me away . 9 / 10",1
", so i thought this movie was incredible . the plot was a little crazy but it came together well . i don  t understand how people say this is a rip - off ... it from many REAL serial and it into these . tiny would be a pathetic excuse for a as well . if anything ... that re - make this movie off .,, making the whole town part of it and all ... just like this movie is , which came out before the remake . the movie was shot and cheesy for a reason ... to try and replicate the late 70  s early 80  s B - slasher flick , which it did a really good job of . the give you a definite sense of who and what they are . they  re written extremely well . same as the plot , it you guessing a little and a lot really well . there  s some stuff that left out , but that  s why there  s a sequel . so everyone  s to their own , but i just think people dislike this for the wrong . it  s cheesy it  s supposed to be . it  s really up it  s supposed to be . the only way it  s like is that  s it  s are based off of real serial ( mainly gin , which also into writing , but would you say is a rip - off of ?). why do you think they have that murder ride trip that they show ? so you can see the between these and the real . so if you don  t like it , fine ... but if you  re call it a rip - off or hate it  s acting is cheesy ... do some homework before you post stuff for other people to see . and , this movie was in .",1
"Whoever thought of casting Furlong in the lead of a Crow movie should be from the industry . With the on , he like an ugly chick . There  t a person in the world who would buy him as  The Crow  or any other comic book hero . he  s a looking who like he would lose in a fight to one of the , let alone any  bad . In fact , the whole movie is poorly cast . Everyone is awful , the director . The only thing this movie in common with the original is the name . It  s a complete mess , bad script , everything . should be like sports . When you do something stupid , you should be or something . Everyone involved in this waste of film should be and suspended .",0
"I can  t explain why but there to be a lot of hostility surrounding this film , so many people hate it and yet it an 8 . 4 ? It strange that a film many will call a disaster could be ranked so highly . The reason for its is that despite the of some it is actually an amazing film . Technically its perfect , the only problem is in the narrative , which is quite a disappointment to say the least . You spend the whole film trying to figure it , trying to untangle the mystery of his and then when its finally revealed you are left feeling , and . To some it is just too much , it the entire film and so the entire thing will be upon as a failure . However , will overlook the ending , or at least come to with it and still respect its more brilliant side the line between realism and insanity , yes it its , but it also many good . It  s the same with  Sympathy for . Vengeance , and it is in  Lady Vengeance  that I can only hope for a combination of both these two better with none of the . You have to remember that it is a trilogy ; each film the other . You may well hate it but to say it is a bad film is just ignorant , personally I love it and give it a 10 out 10 .",0
"Million Dollar Baby is a boxing movie with a twist . It  s a treat to see three great ( , Swank and Freeman ) all their .

Unfortunately , the numerous in logic and character development completely ruined the film to the point where I actually hoped * all * the would die in the most gruesome and creative way possible . To be fair , there are 2 I : the mock surgery by the Creep , and the final scene when   on the platform .

"The High and the Mighty , the granddaddy of air disaster , often into almost melodrama , but under the direction of the legendary  Wild Bill  Wellman , and by one of  s most bombastic yet exciting ( earning him an ), the film such a level of intensity that it remains constantly entertaining . With heading an ensemble cast ( several - from the past , as well as personal ), it is certainly an essential for any  Duke  film library . Produced by - , and  , eventually , by the family  s ( along with  Hondo ,  !, and  Island in the Sky ), the film was a BIG hit , when , and one of  s better , then even greater stature as it was unseen for a generation . I  always the belief that the family to release the entire quartet of in 2007 , to mark the centennial of Duke  s birth , but two the plan ; first , an unauthorized ,   version of  ! was , with that a version of  Hondo  was also in the works , forcing , then President of , to release authorized of the two , rather than have the market with bad ; second , with  s death , in 2003 , the family the master plan , to release the entire collection on . For whatever reason , seeing  The High and the Mighty  again is a cause to celebrate ! Based on K .  s ( which would inspire  s later novel ,  Airport ), the story around a routine commercial flight between and San , which becomes a life - and - death drama when one engine , just beyond the  Point of No Return . With limited fuel , in weather , the crisis out the best and worst in both and crew . as the - pilot , is quite good , a character older than he actually was ( the role had been written for Spencer , who out , just prior to ); Stack almost his character in  Airplane ! as the no - nonsense pilot who goes ballistic when . For cockpit  , however , the award to go to Wally Brown , as the navigator , with his - out , of his shrewish wife , and WILDLY unruly hair ... While the are all , several are quite good in their , with standout by and Sterling ( both - nominated ), Newton , Kelly , and Fix . While to inject humor into his role , it only works sporadically ( and Ann , as his wife ,  hysterical  so convincingly that you want to STRANGLE her !) Day , third - billed ( and , with , a previous leading lady ), is remarkably unlikable as a rich wife with a  bought  husband ( ); the  mandatory  unbalanced type ; and veteran character actor another  ethnic  portrayal to his long list , as a family man ( with a accent !) A bit of trivia : The young boy on board was by director Wellman  s son ! Almost as fascinating as the story is seeing how much , since the film was ; the plane  s  tail  is by and in a rear compartment ; the sole flight attendant is a  stewardess ; and everyone ( especially in the cockpit ). On a more somber note , there is NO security , and one passenger easily , carrying a gun . It is , sadly , a wiser world , today ... While no one would ever accuse  The High and the Mighty  of being a film classic , it  s role in the  airplane disaster  genre can  t be , and it to be a vastly enjoyable feature . It  s great to have it back !",1

"If you feel there  s something innately frightening about a child who to be for , this film will set you like the giddy ,   who sat a few behind me in the theater . No doubt of The Ring , these probably up the nine - buck ticket price to be to the spectacle of another Samara slithering across the screen , dark matted her corpse - pale face . , the sinister presence of Dark Water , fairly withers in comparison to her fellow wraith . Though she a similar untimely death ( in a water tower as opposed to a well ), sports neither creepy coif nor dermis . In fact , she most closely not Samara , but , the living and breathing daughter of , 9F  s new tenant . So when her gaze on and  Don  t leave me , the effect is heartbreaking rather than shriek - worthy , I  m afraid . The film  s climax , in which a struggling under the bubbly water of her tub , is indeed disturbing , but for the wrong reason . The director clearly intended an epic clash between innocence and unbridled evil , but due to  s lack of a ghostly demeanor , what we see is entirely different -- not a demon but a normal little girl another little girl . Needless to say , such a scene is much more harrowing than any display of fantastical , supernatural violence . Shame on for making us sit through it . The ending  t sit well , either . , seeing no other option , herself , offering to be  s mother  forever  if she will let live . ( Why ? Those she in the glass door pretty substantial -- she should have kept smashing . Apparently being with - colored water is enough to make a grown woman give in . And since when do boss around ?)

Although the say clever almost without a break ( and during the we can enjoy their interesting ), the action never either . There is always a good chance for a bullet , a car or a maniac to appear ; 3 . The of physics are the same as in - the take and make wickedly ; 4 . Blood appear to the where used to be a leg or an arm - just like in  Kill Bill ; 5 . Like in   s List , some are in colour : the red dress of a woman in the opening scene , the yellow face of Yellow Bastard ; 6 . Some never talk but they have other good as shooting or throwing swastika to kill people , or cannibalism ; 7 . The are shot , their arms and are off , they are ran over by car , with hard ... but they stay alive and fight back for a long time before dying ; 8 . All the bad get . Hard ; 9 . There is always night in Sin City ; 10 . It  s hard to find a character in the film who is normal ; 11 . Wood a quiet boy who long and cool and who eats people . Slightly different from of  The Lord of the ... 12 . a cop who to waste the ; 13 . The are pretty . They also use wicked to protect themselves against the who try to waste them ... 14 . Josh from the    Pearl Harbour  and  40 Days and 40 Nights  in this film . And this time he  s a bad guy ; 15 . directed a scene where a man with his throat cut ...

"I just saw this movie last night , and I am totally confused . Did kill his wife because he caught her cheating or did she commit suicide ? If he did kill his wife because she was cheating , am I to believe he a split personality disorder because of the  trauma . Or did he just go  crazy  because he found her dead ? Regardless , the ending still stunk up the room . The whole time I thought just about everybody was part of  s multiple personality disorder . I figured ( one of the multiple ) was the guy making all the bad happen because was a vet post traumatic stress and that   was the . I thought the that the cop left were a symbolic way for to start locking up the extra . I thought that when some of the people ( ) , that was the good work of a psychiatrist ridding of the multiple . I actually thought  t have a daughter , and that she was just another personality that was trying to get him to understand that he was the one with a problem . I figured that had actually his wife because of the stress of the War , made him not see rationally . I think my over thinking of this movie ( as my said I did ) would have made a great movie with a great ending .",1
"Well , what can you say ? You watch this great comedy , and for the first few , you  re sitting there thinking , WHAT THE HELL ???? But then you rewind it and start watching it from the start again , and soon you  re practically splitting your sides with laughter !! It  s the comedy I  seen in - why ? Who !! Is it how every character  s voice a unique ( well , peculiar really ) sound ( napoleon  s deep and manly , kip  s ) ? Or is it just that we can relate so well to these , whether at high - school you were the , or whether you were the popular girl who them and them ? My and I  t stop laughing afterwards , and we would text each other from the movie , and fall on the floor in laughter ! I greatly recommend this movie - you either think its the best comedy you  ever seen , or the most ridiculous piece of crap ever made . You might even watch this movie , and at the end say ,  This is pretty much the worst video ever made . And your Mum might reply ,  well , you can leave . So you say ?  YOU ARE RETARDED !! Gosh !",1
"Once again , the great Machine in a really great film and out a completely worthless remake . The original DARK WATER ( though highly derivative of THE RING ) is creepy and scary and everything a good horror movie should be . In it  s incarnation , however , all the life been out of it and what  s left is dull , dull , dull . I can  t even give it credit for the great cast because it  s so utterly BAD . It  s sad that many people might be turned off to seeking out real horror because a lot of the are out by who just don  t get it . Avoid .",0
"As a fan of horror , and one who  s prepare to watch some of the lesser in the genre , I went to see this not an awful lot . As long as it gave me a few and  t too , I  d be reasonably happy . I was pleasantly to find instead a very enjoyable film that kept my attention throughout . Although it  t be as a desperately original script , it did avoid some of the that have plagued recent such as Wrong Turn . The in question at least had a purpose to being in such a perilous situation . Also , Instead of being off one - by - one by an single , unseen , menace , they were en mass by a group of who stayed mostly in sight afterwards . The were given enough of a background to provide some intrigue , but not so much as to slow the early . But best of all , I the way that the ending with your of horror . After a very enjoyable 90 or so , the bog - standard  one - person - - and - someone - you - thought - was - dead - is - still - alive  ending really made my heart sink . So I was relieved when it cut back to the main character still in the , suffering a mental breakdown and facing certain death . It was refreshing to see such a downbeat ending in a low - budget horror film and one that made me think about it long after I left the cinema . Probably the most positive comment I can make about this film is that there was nothing really wrong with it . There were no plot or that felt unnecessary or inconsistent . It set out to create suspense , shock the audience and make them squirm . And that is exactly what it did for me and most of the people in the cinema with me . And for doing its job so well , I  given it 9 out of 10 . Sure , it  s no Citizen , but it does exactly what it out to do . I  yet to see  Dog , which is by the same director , but definitely will now . If it  s as refreshingly un - and as well - made as  The Descent , then it should be a great night  s entertainment .",0

"Sin City was an awe inspiring cinematic event . Never have I see such an effective meld of story , acting , genre and film in one delicious package . For me there were no stand out as all the cast to melt into their and the dark scenery behind them ...... though saying that and Rosario were excellent ( I stop on ) It is interesting to note that some of the cast who were in the same together actually  t film them together and never met .

I have done two myself and I have to say tried to use performance art in this film as a performance film itself at the expense of the audience and it just did not work for me .",1
"There would not be much of a debate about whether it is a wise proposition to attempt to create a respectable movie from a successful television series . Notwithstanding a handful of (  s , M * A * S * H , Peewee  s Playhouse ( the first one ), The Fugitive ( the first one ), Mission Impossible , and Batman ( the first and last one ), most have fallen by the wayside as so much fluff or really bad stuff . There is something about the small screen to the big that even the most talented of / . Such is the case with . been responsible for a couple of the most endearing of the past ten . Sleepless in and You  Got Mail are down two of the most memorable of their kind to come along in many . In both , combined heart , soul , and a deep sense of character to create ast0nishingly insightful and watch - able . In her present endeavor , however , she somehow the previous successful formula and miserably . Sometimes I just can  t imagine how with such a wealth \u0096 a literal \u0096 of talent can fail . But this one does and does so grandly . The twist is cute . A production within a production was probably a good idea to start with . We follow the - been character of Jack ( Will ) as he an attempt to resuscitate his bombed out movie career by the character of in the famous sit - of the 60  s / 70  s . Ironically , the line in the movie is when Jack the fact that he is , a character that they mid series , and NO ONE . This is unfortunately a bit of unintended of to come . The usually infectious is flat as a pancake in his bid to give this pompous ass some life . Along the same , really up the place as . the  nobody  the Jack be cast opposite his  star , is all wrong . The only thing she does right is the nose twitch , and she does do it well , but she a accent that is nothing short of annoying and for some god forsaken reason all the depth of character she ordinarily for a white - washed and infantile characterization that is dreadfully shallow . Whew ! Needless to say , we don  t care about the in the least . A great part of the charm of the original series was the  star crossed  aspect and the societal allegory the union of  different  of people . None of that is even touched on here , and if it were we  t care anyway . The most disturbing thing of all is that  s style was perfect for this movie . There is so much potential here it literally you sick . Not even the incredible of Mac Laine and the indomitable can salvage this piece of claptrap . The bottom line is , avoid this flick . It might me a good one to find while through the after a few Bud at the end of a long weekend , but even then I doubt it would keep attention for long . It is so sad to waste all the talent associated with . Poor , poor , wherever she is , to have her legacy in such a foul way ; shame on them all . And you all thought I everything !",1
"I read a lot of on million dollar babe and i  t read on bad yet and i hope i  m never going to read one bad on this movie . This movie is probable the best movie of 2004 . Clint did a very good job this movie . If Clint is on stopping or acting in , million dollar babe should not be the last one . All i can say about this movie is the acting of this entertaining movie . The acting in this movie could  be any better except for  s ( Swank ) family , ( ), ( ). Those two  t that great in this movie but it still made a very good movie .",0
"There  s just something too cool about spending two or so just looking at Brad and . Talk about a and Ken couple !!! Whoever had the idea of the two of them together in what a loose and naughty remake of 1989  s Turner / outing in  War of the  must be in the glow of a brilliant idea . The classic  husband and wife repartee  movie is in the house once again . Directed by ,  The Supremacy  ( 2004 ) and   ( 1996 ),  . and . Smith  is a delightful albeit darkly allegory of the modern marriage . Beginning and ending in the therapist  s office , this film comes full circle in its panoramic treatment of married life in the twentieth century . In the beginning , the couple is obviously going through relatively normal relationship growing . been married for six , they seem to be what most married experience ( remember  The Seven Year Itch ?). It quickly becomes apparent that their are far from normal and their  growing  far from traditional . Like most , each of these two is keeping some from the other one . Unlike most , their respective are far more serious than the average  jar theft , or  lust in my heart  type of . They are both secretly hired . Yes , , hit - men / !! They met during a hit , fell in love , and simply showing one another their true colors by slipping into a boring off to work in the morning / home for dinner in the evening routine . Now after six of marriage , they are with each other because they obviously can share so little of their  real  life with their mate . All this for a great dilemma . Don  t misunderstand , this movie is far from perfect , but what it is is entertaining and really pretty to look at . Now , back to the . Both of these   had great in small at the start of their .  s memorable turn in  and  and  s performance in   are the kind of unforgettable little that one  t easily forget and that set one up for success . Both have gone on to become big with bigger . Both are  supposed  to make their make money . Unfortunately they have both had their share of questionable , but that goes with the territory . Both are well established and incontrovertibly talented . It truly one pause to wonder just how well the chemistry so fondly about will gel between these two strong . Well . suffice it to say , the abound . Throughout this movie , these two click on all . In the indomitable style of and , and intellectually and physically spar from beginning to end making for a raucous and undeniably satisfying jaunt through the of their complicated . The plot is relatively simple - with a twist . Their chosen are exposed to one another when they are sent on the same job . Because of the interference of the other  half , they are equally unsuccessful in their assassination attempt and are therefore with the unpleasant job of  taking care of  the renegade intruder in their respective . Of course , it is soon revealed that their nemeses are indeed themselves . In order to not give away a couple of cute little , no more will be revealed here . The important thing is that the movie is two of grand fun . Never taking itself too seriously , this vehicle is a kaleidoscope of enchanting little . Smooth and non - interfering direction combined with seamless and skilled acting make for an enjoyable and entertaining respite from the hustle and bustle of life . To be able to immerse oneself in the altogether more complicated existence of these two the wont for more . The success or failure of this type of movie on the ability of the film to leave the viewer breathless . In that respect they succeed . Rampant with lots of action , , and cool ,  Smith  is engaging entertaining . Bottom line , the chemistry is there , the action is there , and fine direction is there . As in his previous , is able to carry the through the action without sacrificing depth of character in any way . This is as much as testament to the acting ability of his as to his directorial prowess , but the amalgamation of the two for a very likable film . If you haven  t seen it yet , go see it .",1
"Gong Fu / Kung Fu Hustle is a comedy action movie made out of different like western , martial and slapstick and mixed together in an amusing mix . are , are . It on a simple film and a twist on it . That  s where all the fun comes from here . And from the many reference to other . The action are great as they are by Woo - ping from The Matrix .

"So how do you go about making a movie that , in enough detail to please everyone , the effects of of of influence , the modern day influence of arms from to various , the influence of the UN , United , civil war and what them , . . - and all of it in a time period that people will be willing to sit through ? I think the dealt with in this movie are far more complicated in their history and than people know and some of the criticism is outrageous . I  m waiting for the  UN is a Horse on our shore  s  to start . A UN Propagand film - are you serious ? and as for the accuracy the of this movie did what of other movie have done in the depiction of complicated , they used composite and the time line to make the movie flow . there  t one or two - there were a dozen or more and he had to know what to bribe each of them with to get and protection - but it would have been too complicated to try to depict all of them .

"In honor of its recent release to , I have chosen Million Dollar Baby to review . Never have I had so many ask me about a single film ,  Josh , is it good ? Should I buy it ? Is it worth it ? After telling them how great it is , I usually tell them that I it back in when I was walking out of the theater and said to my dad ,  That  s win best picture . ( He smartly agreed with his great prophet son , so maybe not great , but a proved prophet by that statement ) Clint and as , the spiritually lost and hard nosed boxing manager of many successful men . Swank , who won best actress for her portrayal of , through poverty and a trashy family to finally get to manage and train her . Morgan Freeman also his much as , which he also took home an for best supporting actor . As did with Man , Clint a contender from the of a metaphorical hell in order to for the ultimate dream becoming world champion in professional boxing . In a special twist , it is the  s division of boxing , instead of the over - used men  s division . The boxing ring works as a sanctuary for the character  s , keeping them from an outside world that to bring them nothing but bad news ( I don  t think Freeman  s character leaves the gym once in the film ). Baby  is a film filled with  s Dirty Harry attitude that is meant to cover up a sensitive heart and man . The interaction between the cynical trainer and hard working can be so comical that you sometimes forget you are watching a serious drama . The comic relief along with the tough we must make in life play well in this most deserving winner of the Best Picture of the year for 2004 .",1
"I the dark to this film . It felt to me like a modern , expanded  Twilight Zone  episode and also had of to it . What made me feel this at first was the great film score and then as I watched further it become more apparent to me . I am a huge fan of the Rod  s  Twilight Zone  series and this really had that feeling to it . I would have to say that I have seen similar in plot before ... a man who may or may not be people or around him . I thought to myself while watching , these people better be real ... otherwise I  seen this way too many times . But I think Bale is a great actor and I really his character here . Everything in his physical presence he really went the distance for this role and his acting was top notch . The cinematography was wonderful also , and I suppose that goes back to the Twilight Zone - that I love . Definitely worth seeing .",1

There is a reason that this is a classic story , but the film - obviously chose to ignore it . They left the most basic in and took out many key . After awhile , I lost interest due to being distracted by all of the in this classic tale . If your going to make a movie out of one of the most important of the ancient world , you had better stick to the tale . There  s a reason why  The  is a classic . Learn it !!

"I have to admit that the March of the was a pretty big disappointment . Morgan Freeman  s - language narration is dull and uninspired . The best are those that don  t call attention to the personality of the narrator , but leave you waiting for the to find out  who was that guy ? In this case , though , it was impossible to do other than to recognize Freeman  s voice at every turn . The tone of his narration is too low , his presentation too dull , and the lack of any sense of enthusiasm in his voice was unfortunate in such an otherwise interesting film . The deserved better . Worse than that , though , was the jarring electronic music that Freeman  s narration . At times the sound was so loud that Freeman  s were hard to understand . When you imagine how much better a classical score would have been the music in this film egregiously bad . Some of the photography in the film was marvelous , though is it really something we haven  t seen before ? I  m sorry to be so negative about this March of the . It  s not a really bad film , just disappointing . Or maybe I  m just suffering from emperor penguin overload .",0
"To all of the Crow series , this is by far the worst of the Crow . Although an interesting concept with the open for so much , this movie completely flat . Horrible dialogue , lousy action , and probably one of the worst casting I  ever seen in a movie .  s performance was a little too far over the top , and comes off almost laughable . For of  s performance in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel series , most should be extremely disappointed by this role . Hopper  s role in the film was just plain annoying , and even Tara  s sex appeal  t help this movie . Truthfully , I will say that Furlong  s performance might be the only thing that is worth watching in the film . Although his portrayal of the character was different from any other from the Crow series , Furlong the essence of the crow . With such a large cult following for the series , I believe that many will see the film simply because it is a Crow film . Even for all the die - hard Crow , I suggest that this one be rented before you buy .",0
"This movie is good for those who like rain or . The movie was actually not worth seeing . No real plot , bad acting , bad , and pointless . The apartment setting could have really saved the movie , but it unclear what the us to do - that is - to be stiff , or to see the movie as a ( family ) drama . In addition the whole separation  thingy  only added length to the movie as opposed to the overall plot . Many of the movie were very predictable , with many already during the promotion of the film . In addition , the acting is very unoriginal , as many in the movie could be found in the Ring , Darkness , to name a few .",0

The only saving grace is that we saw it at the price of $ 5 . 50 each but even that was far too much to pay to see this movie . I don  t care one whit about Brad but I do like and I think that both did the best they could with what they had to deal with but this movie is just tiresome . Good premise but it at the end , BIG TIME !!!! I  m that the director , , writer , ..... the .....  t see the slowdown during the last 20 or so . Don  t want to spoil anything so I  say this . Believe me , I  m not one to fall asleep easily . I have to have complete silence and darkness but yet , I damned near fell asleep during that part of the movie !!

"About Clint  s last movie I  d it was something we had seen a million times ; very . I don  t pretend to get inside the story , because I  t tell much of it , but it is , with a simple look , what we  already seen in  Rocky , and maybe in  Karate ; two classic of the genre . But Clint  t dig the classic , he digs the proper ; and the fact of not winning the he won this year with  Mystic River  is intriguing . And  Million Dollar Baby  won them not because of its relation with other , but on its own right . The emotional power this movie and many other , are comparable to the equally good  Mystic River . The thing is how great he is and he with the in white ; simple , over the black screen in both . Anyway ,  Million Dollar Baby  is another movie , and if it late in the radar , it  t matter because knew what he had in his and what it would be , more than anyone . Again he for that excellent would adapt ( the last time , now Haggis ), composed the music and produced his piece . However he is not , and if one  t know what is to see , out about all this in the end . This round , he added an habitual detail in his , that turned down a couple of ago , but now in another nomination : his performance in the movie . Between the darkness and the sow well handled under his lead , I was able to see some that spoke for themselves , and . The pro was also thrilling in the beautifully written , his character , with Scrap ( by Morgan Freeman ). With a lot of knowledge , both men as the they are and as their , who have been giving each other support since always , and know that  s not going to change , so they  re not afraid of honesty . These turn out to be between the film  s best . Clint directed and in top form , without forgetting about the around him . In Swank he saw the love and commitment with acting , getting the best of her , en what is more than a transformation . The transformation is part of the commitment , but the love in knowing how to use it , because : What good does a transformation if it won  t be taken advantage of ? one of the best ensemble works I  seen since ... Well , since  Mystic River , Morgan Freeman his once again , and talking wisely to receive the he should have had over a decade ago for  The Redemption , were he was splendid . The way Clint to escape from the obvious ( a man who directed lots of , which are pretty obvious ), can be seen clearly in all those where you  re waiting something typical and his camera , or his movie  s script ,  t give it to you . In  Rocky , the man trained by himself , and felt of that ; in  Million Dollar Baby , our girl is in desperate need for one only trainer , and besides being of , him . It  s amazing how he her back .",1
"I  d like to first comment on why i chose to give this film 5 / 10 . The only reason why is because its got a different plot from other of this zombie genre , so I give credit for the idea . Other than that , the only other thing i can say about this movie is that there is senseless violence . I don  t understand why there was so much weird gore . There was so much unnecessary stuff that kept the movie at a stand still ; there was probably about 45 of watching eat and kill in really weird ways . In several it people being in normal zombie like ways , but it would then switch to someone who  s belly button piercing is bitten off , someone who torn apart and all his internal everywhere ... and this a lot randomly throughout the movie . This movie is only if you are completely drunk ! One word to sum it up ? Pathetic !!!",0
"Let me begin by growing up that I was a huge Star fan . I was one who was extremely disappointed at the Phantom Menace ( e . g . I it ) and thought was just going through the . With Revenge of the Sith somewhat himself . Visually , the action are stunning . I saw this movie at a Digital in , which is the way you should watch it . , the of a great story in Sith . In the opening sequence into his ( on by ) to kill Count after he him in battle . Basically , the emperor this to see if is the future apprentice that he . You realize that really everything ( the war ) is being by the emperor . Basically , the story around the fact to control the future and that occur around him , rather than them play their natural course ( which is the way ). If anything he is guilty of loving too much , when  s are not suppose to have possessive love or attachment . In his fear of losing his wife he is by the Dark Side into thinking giving into it is the only way he can save her . The  s advice on the other hand ( provided by ) is to let play out . Many do not like the fact that a more pathetic creature in the end , rather than this almighty evil being we thought he was when we first saw Star . However , I think after seeing what , underneath the mask in Empire and Return we should have known that was really his story . A guy who could not control his . However , this is the problem that into . While he can still come out with a great story plot , he really cannot write one . The love in the movie are and badly written . The that made the first three and especially Empire and Star so great are few and far between . The acting in the movie is not bad . The real problem is the writing is so weak any actor would have difficulty many of the off . In addition , there to be no real reason in turning . Yes , he is weary of the  s ( they are him to spy on the emperor , which actually up being ), yes he is tortured by the thought of his wife dying . However , in one scene he is telling Obi Wan how much he him , then himself to destroy the emperor then boom ! he turns to the dark side , there to be no real trigger for him to do so . In addition , I have also found that the pace of the this movie like I and is . Even though the special effects are superior to - the movie to move much . that aside the last 1 / 2 an hour or so of battle between and Obi Wan is brilliant . There is a real emotional battle . with a real hatred that you would expect a Lord too . And FINALLY in the first three you get a real emotion connect , as you see burning up writhing in pain telling Obi Wan that he him . Obi Wan yelling at him telling him that he him like a brother ... before walking away in pity and disgust . Then of course you see the birth of ... Many people had a problem with about his wife , thinking it made him too human . However , remember it is not until of himself from that he truly becomes . Overall this is easily the best of the , but when you watch the first trilogy you realize there is still something missing to this movie . However , it almost , almost up for it by being visually so stunning . 7 / 10 Sincerely ,",1
"... but let  s face it , the Dog is a WAY cooler title . In short , this is the best script put to film , ever . That  s saying a lot , considering the man come up with some pretty cool ( e . g ., , 5th Element ). The bad guy ( Bob ) his version of a human story , and each character in the film his / her own persona . It  s awesome . The like real life , the human interaction like real life , but sadly the action not so real life . The bigger action follow through like a fight by the flick from the  80  s , very reminiscent of early Van - Damme . The bad line up one by one , waiting their turn to be taken out by Li . Alas , this NEVER me with this film , for being Jet Li still the crap beat out of him ( several times ), and the whole fight - by - the - is offset by some really cool camera work . You can feel the energy out each sequence , even the really short . It  s hard for an action flick to do that nowadays . The acting is top - notch , especially in Li  s character . Given the fact that I his performance in  The One  ( just like old times , eh , buddy ? ugh .), it still  t stop me from enjoying the crap that movie . With  the Dog  ( Unleashed  in the ) I got a special treat ... Jet Li off a wonderful performance in being a torn little boy in a grown - up body , trying to accept that he is , in fact a  dog , yet to be human , even before his freedom . The fact is , he is raised like dog by his  uncle , a role that Bob tore into like a rabid animal . I know this term around a lot , but I quite literally mean it when I say , was born for this role , and I thoroughly watching him as much as I watching Li . All in all , this is a fascinating action - drama , which I gave a 9 out of 10 . I would have it at a 10 , if the action  t so by the . Kudos to the film , this is a movie worth .",1
"I  m going to begin by saying that people who say that this is not like the Ring are not completely wrong , but they are not completely right either . This movie PLENTY in common with the Ring -- the water , the ghostly girl , and some other that might be considered as on here . But the thing is that we accept most of the that happen in the Ring . That is not the same here . Most of the that go on in this movie are pointless . I went over the story a few times and tried to tie in certain that stood out a lot . It for a long time and I know why , but these could have told the story much more quickly and it still would have made sense .  Made sense -- I use that term loosely because almost nothing here sense , especially when this . The ghostly girl -- the imaginary friend of the mother  s daughter -- is what this up for me . The story is about a woman : so much trauma throughout her life and she is facing a very difficult situation when the film , and it is almost like the dark water is in on her . Stop it right there . That for a psychological thriller , which is what this REMOTELY is . The movie could have done away with a lot of and been pretty fair . But we will get away from there and go to the good . The atmosphere and music are good , the dark and dank . The and the symbolism are both well - done . And the acting , especially by , is solid and decent . It is too bad that these good could not be incorporated into a better film . This just itself in its own darkness of confusion and pointlessness . And as for the scare factor : it is not scary at all . Most people would probably find it disturbing , but not scary . If you the Ring and / or the Ring 2 ( which was as disappointing as this ), then you will like this and see the clarity through the water =) 4 . 8 / 10",1
"I found it extremely difficult to sit through this  Blockbuster . THere just  t anything there to keep me .  s portrayal of the , , obsessive compulsive , maniac , was just as any of his ... Long , boring , overly dramatic , and up with a really funny voice . During one part of the movie , an airplane he is flying a horrible crash in the middle of a large area . I  never felt happier to see a character dying in a film . And yet ... he ! , a woman whom I admire in , had the most annoying and pointless part in the film . She to be the  fallback  girl for , who he to marry , just because , him down into nothingness , and then him back up because she sorry for him . She sort of a  woman of the evening  feeling about her . You are also not in this movie , pointless nudity , which is to say that we see quite a bit of a naked , who is afraid of the on his clothes 3 / 4 of the way into the film . It was pointless ! All in all , it was difficult to stay in the room while this movie was . It  s ending  t play out , and I just have the feeling that I wasted 2 and a half of my life .",1

"To enjoy this movie you basically have to throw away your sense of reality . I got this for my birthday just a little while ago ; I did plan on seeing it so that worked out nicely . is a washed up oceanographer who and revenge upon a mythical jaguar shark that ate his friend right in front of him . The main idea of the story is to invoke revenge upon the jaguar shark ( i . e . blow it up ). Right in the beginning we  re to , who may or may not be  s son . up taking him under his wing and him a part of Team . Together possible father and possible son hunt the jaguar shark . The over all movie does concentrate on the hunt , even though at some it really  t seem like it . The movie  t laugh out loud funny either . The movie does have a few humorous , but not enough to make it an extremely funny movie . The overall story is good , and at some surprising , even a little dramatic . I recommend it to most people .",0
"I saw the film yesterday night and I can  t stop thinking about it . It is not a film to escape the reality for two , on the contrary this is a film which you in the real life . The are good chosen , almost each nationality living in is . It us how our are affecting us in our and doings , and how we judge our fellow men with our stereotyped . The in the film confront their own and show us that inside of all of us a good one and a bad one , that we  learn  our and that there is always a possibility to change our way of thinking and our . It was frightening to see about the Verisimilitude of the film and how little we trust each other . I can just recommend to see this film and remember that we all are foreigner at almost every point of this world .",0
"and have something going on . As and Hart were to the screwball comedy , as and were to the Broadway musical , and as and were to banter comedy , and should go down in entertainment history as the team that perfected the biographical movie . As an encore to their amazing collaboration in  A Beautiful Mind  the actor / director team a brooding , harrowing , and soulful journey through a slice of the life of boxer Jimmy , an unlikely heavyweight champ of the depression 1930  s . Given the success of  Man  it apparent that this is a franchise in the making . The movie itself is simple . It a relatively short time in the life of boxer and his family and does not rely on an entire lifetime to make its point . No study of childhood psychological baggage here . It is very simply the gritty nature of  s quest , the interplay between him , his wife , his and his always supportive manager , and the oppression of the era that are the recipe that this move a compelling work . Set during a period in our history where the real of the Great Depression are oftentimes either or , no in the inhumanity of that slice of our history . an almost tone to the color , an era of gloom and doom is aptly , throwing the viewer into a realistic reality of calamity . We are even taken on a not so pretty tour of  Ville  in 1930  s Central Park that cannot help but move even the most stalwart of movie . Effectively this as his backdrop , the film so that the last hour is literally as we follow through his final trek toward and into the title fight . The fight themselves are remarkable in their ability to get the audience involved in each . Even with full knowledge of the outcome ,  s journey is exciting and suspenseful . This is great film - making . is quite simply a great actor . His chameleon like ability to  become  is a joy to experience . Together with his character we feel his frustration , his angst , and almost overwhelmingly , his pain , both physically and emotionally . When he to ask for public assistance and is forced to  beg  from boxing fat so as not to break a promise to his little boy that he would never send him away to live in their desperate times , it is almost excruciating to watch . We feel what he , we know what he , and we hurt like he . This is great acting . The supporting cast is great also .  is as ever in her long suffering support of the title character . She the ability to pull us equally into the story and a great role out of a weakly written part . She is truly the great woman behind this man . Equally effective in his role is as  s manger . He is always there for . He almost like a guardian angel in his  never say die  demeanor , and his quest to continue  s career . When he that they are his license , we feel all the pain associated with to break bad news to those we care about . His exuberance during the final fight is contagious . as killer fighter and Paddy as  s friend on the also turn in excellent . As to prove himself a truly great director , to pad his resume  with meaty and heartfelt in the vein of the best movie like , Bogart , and . .  s ability to re - create himself in the context of every character he him in a very small class with a very high caliber of movie actor . just might be the consummate  actor  s  director . His ability to glean stellar out of every actor in his from the walk across to his biggest is nothing short of phenomenal , and certainly no fluke . Over and over again , proved himself .  Man  will take it  s place on his already prestigious resume  as one of his best , and hopefully this will not be the last we see of these two working together .",1
"I get the feeling that people  s of this movie are such that if  t deliver anything short of  Hamlet  they were going to resentfully dig a very deep hole in the ground and toss him in . Personally , I think I finally something about these Star : they are the cinematic equivalent of comic . I don  t mean this as an insult . It  s just that it  s hard for me to take some of the negative I  read seriously - harder to take in fact than  s ridiculous for turning to the dark side , or the much - love between and , or , well , as a character in general . However , as comic book hero - come - villain ? Post it on and I  bid . I really Episode . Perhaps it was the from the original  Star  that crept in towards the end , I don  t know , I just did .

Fortunately , and perhaps somewhat surprisingly , these were kept to a minimum in Episode , while finally cranked up the . Seen as a comic book come to life , it  s just amazing .

"I love Sap . And I love . I  d rather see a  sappy  movie any day , than ANYTHING the entertainment field is offering me  fresh from . There is a reason that been in a terrible slump lately . Maybe by some this movie  t  realistic enough  these days , but maybe that alone is half the appeal . The definition these days of  realistic  usually crude , rude , and jaded . It mostly something I don  t want my to see , and it always something I am not relaxed or comfortable watching , either . If is  unrealistic , then so be it . But for my two , those people in this movie were a lot more  real  than what is generating these days . One thing I saw was a mind set among the that came from a day when meant something , and they all still had a conscience . And they all very much to be better than they really were . And it  t take near as much to remind them that they to work out right . I  d rather see that  sappy  attitude any day .

"A horribly disturbing piece of work with great looking great doing great work . I felt , but the all hit their with precision . Just when the character would be fully in other , an underlying attribute or personality trait or quirk of fate would just shake this world up a bit . A nice change of pace from the regular cutter movie , but then again maybe not . Maybe this movie was just cut from a bigger cutter . Certainly within the of THIS movie the same cutter was used to display the and of life that are often not seen or to be shown in other .",0
"I just want to know exactly who . was trying to appeal to in this movie . Not only is the  sport genre tired , they are geared primarily for most of the time . But with Billy Bob ( who I thought was hilarious in  Bad ), one would guess they are trying to bring in the older . The movie like it split . There is a ton of and adult humor that would definitely NOT appeal to of younger , but many of the just  t funny to me because they were at the younger . The movie is not terrible , but its not good either . It is simply a forgettable movie , which is a shame because I think is a great director and Billy Bob like a natural when it comes to comedic timing .",1
"After all the powerful horror brought us in the last few - whether it be Ring , Grudge or whatever , this be the worst . there are a few scare , maybe just one or two , but this film really does get boring after .. about 20 .

And i  m not a person that  t get in either , but - Jane No one  s hair is probably the thing in this movie . Invest your money in a better movie .",1
"Perfection . The timing of the on and off screen would make you dizzy . The was slow and building to the finale . Whereas you like a rocket from the moment you see after his friend was . The of some of the is the sign of genius . This is now in my top 5 favorite along with the outstanding Big and Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind . It maybe as a comedy but the of the character and the arc they complete does leave you feeling that you know the . off to for his best role since . A true find .....",0
"I am 28 and watched the original series . Honest quote ,  do tonight ... oh i don  t know , why don  t we go see of Garbage ? That  s exactly what i thought about this movie when i read all the . This movie is the next in a long line of classic made to . Not all can capture enough of the original series to make it reliable to the watcher . Take for instance I Spy , , and ( yet to see this one ). I think the actually does it . The only drawback is the modern day setting ( but i think it still works since is 1970  s setting no matter what century we  re in ). Sure the acting was nasty , and the were somewhat over done . But , i am the only one to remember the original show . Bo like a bleach bum surfer , and Luke like a Chips . Both fit the Pop Culture attitude , , and of the time to a tee . This version does the same . The also that would be the  link  and it as the should have . She was used more as eye candy that original Daisy was , and had less speaking than i thought . But at least it  t the of a strong female character that with  2 . The top 3 any fan should ask is : 1 . Is the car true to the original 2 . Are the chase true ... 3 . Are the true ... Well , i think they deliver pretty well on the first 2 . The 3rd , well not so much . Those of you born post 1985 , and the show , check it out before condemning the movie as  WORST MOVIE EVER . True that can  t get over the b / w the original and these , just forget the movie , buy the and remember the good  times .",0
"off to a very bad start . The plot is known in advance : a real witch , almost accidentally , hired to star in a new series based on the old series  . What little drama the plot is how she and then her magical . But the film with  s revealing her little secret to the audience almost immediately ; she a house and her magic to make herself at home . Even though we know in advance that is a witch , from a dramatic and comic point of view , that little secret should be revealed little by little . Just like THE SHOW , this film but one real plot twist and the blow it before the theme music stopped on the . The idea to make a big screen version of   had been bouncing around for over a decade and obviously it through too many -- all of whom must have added their own little . The result is a project that certainly  t short on inspiration , but is woefully short on purpose . What surely as a straightforward remake of the series ( witch mortal and to live the normal life of a suburban housewife ), somehow took a twist into a story about the show . Not an altogether bad idea ; but taken the leap of faith of moving the material from to satire , the don  t run with the idea . If real witchcraft a part of a real show , how would it be used ? To cast a spell so that everyone in the country would watch ? Or not watch ? To make people laugh at every joke , no matter how unfunny the material ? To take control of the network ? But what does do ? She a trained dog come to her during a scene so she can steal a . Oh wow , all the power in the world and she it to upstage her fellow . Other than of passing trivia , little of the original series remains a part of the movie , especially the central concept . On ,  s to renounce witchcraft in order to conform to  s work ethic ; it is , in essence , the story of royalty for the love of a commoner . And yet , it is also the story of a mixed marriage : Dick York  s into a family with a different ethnic background and becomes the target of their bigotry . The of class distinction and racial confrontation had resonance in the turbulent 1960  s . The strength of the  s marriage was measured by  s commitment to sacrifice and  s defiant defense of his class , culture and mortality . Both had something to fight for and to protect . In the movie , instead of being kept apart by  religious  and interfering family , the plot to the usual romantic comedy . Worse , and her would - be ( Will ) have no chemistry ; she  s doing and he  s for the camera like Jerry Lewis . And it is hard to respect any movie that up and and their to barely memorable . The unfulfilled promise of step into  s iconic role as , the ultimate in meddling mother - in - , is particularly galling . And while and do fine to  s Uncle and  s Aunt , their as fictional in the film  s  real  world no sense . The film  t even have the convoluted logic of a supernatural . I suppose the film should be given credit for not going overboard on the special effects , but so little is done with the whole idea of witchcraft that it hardly any role in the actual story . Given a project where flamboyant special effects actually make sense for a change , the inexplicably balk , settling for parlor rather than eye - wizardry . And a film about magic precious little -- in its special effects , its screenplay , its direction or its . Instead of being it de - witched .",1
"Before I saw the first that had out on the net , I  t know about the Sin City graphic at all . But , simply by watching that trailer , my very high right away . I sometimes watched the trailer for fun , simply because it was so good , and so much . The other that were official , even more . I  never so much for a movie since I for Kill Bill . Did it keep its promise ? It did , and more . The visual style was absolutely fantastic , with the movie being completely in black and white with of colour here and there , such as a red dress , the flashing of the police or  s blue . The story were simple and straightforward . Some have the movie shallow , and I suppose it was , but for some reason this is not bad in any way . We  re sent into Sin City for two and we get to see a different world , a world real and unreal ... and it good ! It  s easy getting into this strange parallel universe , where you can find anything . It  s dark and exciting . It  s a place where the men are raw and hard , and the are cool and always beautiful . It  s ago and it  s today . The acting was good . I  t expect anything else with such an impressive list of excellent / . Here are some of them , and what I thought about them : Alba is Nancy , a stripper at the  s bar . Alba is doing a pretty good job , actually . Just about good enough for this role , but not any more than that , in my opinion . is , one of the of Old Town . I don  t think she anything at all in the movie . Hard to say much about the acting , but it like she did her job . is , one of the of the Old Town . I have to admit I was curious to see in such a movie , after seeing her as Rory in . Except for a few weak here and there , she did a great job on the whole . Rosario is , one of the de leader of Old Town . I love the way did this character . love her mischievous smile . Toro is Boy , a no good cop . Toro must be some sort of acting genius . He is one of the outstanding in this movie , he is really , * really * good as Boy , even when is supposed to be dead . is Cardinal . Another small role in this movie . Even so , he  s doing a great job . King is Goldie / , twin and of Old Town . This is , as far as I remember ( and I  m very sure ) the first time I get to see her work . I think that her sensuality is where her hotness and cool intersect . Murphy is , a bar maid at  s . Here is another one who does her job incredibly well . For a while we have Murphy and Toro in the same ; a real treat . Murphy  s facial , , the way she her - just sit back and enjoy . Ace performance by Murphy . is . Great character who his way through Sin City with fury and humour in order to find vengeance on whoever Goldie . does it well . Nick is ./ Yellow Bastard . A who is after Nancy , and after her , he to kill him . I  m not familiar with  s previous works , I believe , but he certainly to play this part well . is , a good cop . I recently saw Die Hard , and I have to say he  t seem to have a terribly wide range as an actor , but then again his usually  t seem to give much room either . For such , the one as , he  s a good choice . Wood is , one of the more terrifying . No for Wood , and it  s not much he needs to do , I guess , except staring without expression , or trying to fight . It may sound like I  m raving about all the , but I hope it  s also clear that in some I can  t say much about the acting , and that in some it  s great , sometimes good and sometimes weak . Anyway , I this movie . Unfortunately it was from the big screen in my city after only a month , and by that time I  seen it only four times . I  just need to get the ... This is an easy 10 / 10 .",1
"I absolutely do not know , why people have put down for this movie , because I thought before going to the theater that I  m wasting 75 behind the ticket , but after watching the movie , I felt so good that I even my friend for free . The movie got a weak story line , but thats made up by some quite mind blowing action , visual effects , and camera workmanship . The movie is very gripping with a steady flow of heavenly music in the background . The is a must buy for anyone who watched this movie . The camera action to be again as should be the visual effects , the plane with slow motion action are simple out of this world ... Josh does a respectable job , so does , although the romance between them is shown somewhat clumsily , Fox does another cameo performance as a comic side kick , making it more enjoyable ... Also , the for this movie is unearthly , it  s so so damn good that it  s hard to explain .. This movie also a part of the dirty cover work of the U . S . Navy and the U . S . , clearly pointing out the corruption involved ... Overall a very well deserving 9 / 10 ...",1

It is a must read , I hope they will make a movie out of it , and will use the same cast . ( Would ruin it otherwise ) That would be a Godsend . It is so from the beginning of  The Notebook , to the end of  The Wedding . This story a inner soul . Should have won all the that year . I have the movie and both of the .

He just to ooze the corruption of a southern aristocrat . And he good in a white suit . Speaking of looking good , is so hot in this movie ! And even though I don  t think the shorts were short enough , I was wrong about her being a bad choice . She brought all the and lustful that Daisy deserved . All in all , very good and I think if you  re not some stuck up purist , you should see this movie .",0
"When I rented the movie I was a horror movie and I was wrong . It was high drama , intense , a thriller , a beautiful love story , a story about life and about change . Visually it was beautiful - some were like a piece of art . I particularly the of the sweeping and dancing on the porch . The music was incredible . I kept over and over just to hear the music . I then went out and bought the . The acting was like more of a stage play then an everyday movie . There was an unexpected twist and the end of the movie that really made it extra special .

For me , the first two Harry Potter  felt  perfect , they felt right . To be frank , they felt like Harry Potter ! I  read the a dozen times each , and from what I read , I had my own vision of what Harry  s world would be like . it amazingly , exactly as I  d it . Alfonso  s was , but he to have an awful lot and tried too hard to get the movie into a  new  style , his style . This , I feel , is why I  m opposed to his version to  s . However , despite all that , the movie is very good ( excellent for the last 30 ). The acting is good , and the movie at a great pace ; you really feel it been a year at . There are a handful of  cringe - worthy  , which really bug me . You  know them when you see them , trust me . Anyway , definitely see this movie and form your own opinion . It  s not all bad , seriously . I just wish had directed it , I have the strange feeling it would of been better and  fitted  in with the first two .( 4 / 5 )",1
"The casting of Colin as was one of the all time in movie casting . He could not even suppress his accent for all his . He so out of place in this role .

I  never had to endure so much boring endless in my life . What did the Director  s Cut add ... more boring . And how about those stupid flash almost the same boring between and his  crazy  mother , another with . I had to pause this movie 3 times and rest before I could go on watching it , it would have some quality by the end . It did not .

"Was it ? Yes . Was it silly ? Yes . Was it filled with mid an late dance music ? Oddly , yes . Did I and my enjoy it ? Most definitely ! In general if is in a movie , I avoid it like the plague . However , in this case , I  m glad the 3 and 5 year old to go . It was an enjoyable way to spend a hot summer afternoon . The special effects were well done , and not overdone . The violence was enough not to upset the . It  s the first time that my 3 year old sat still for an entire movie . It was also the first movie that  t make me want to vomit . Definitely two up ! I would see it again . , Carter still is hot .",1
"Let me first comment on a peculiar phenomenon that my choice of film . I sometimes have this feeling where i  m in the need of easy and fast entertainment like blade 3 or bad 2 , so when i  m about to rent a movie I often prefer these above , for example , Lost in Translation , while at the same time i find these sort of to be  less  than the of more mature . so it took me a while before i decided to rent Lost in Translation and now that i have seen this movie I must say and I must comment on this site , how great this movie really is . This a lot coming from a guy who like , Hero and Scarface over drama . But is this because i don  t like drama or is it because I have the wrong idea of drama . Drama to me , almost always mean people crying every 5 , unwanted and misfit sentiment with a story that 4 out of five times  t interest the biggest titanic fan ( really movie ). If this drama then Lost in Translation is not a drama film . It is the only movie i  ever rented 2 times in one week , and for a movie without any excitement or action this really is a wonderful feat . As is the fact that it left me with both a smile as well as a head full of because it is a movie you don  t quickly forget about . technically it great acting , a plus for Bill subtle but brilliant role , and for great understanding of a character , it a simple but greatly executed , and been expertly directed by . This all it a good movie , but it  s the feeling about the whole movie , that cinematic magic that can  t be in , that it a great movie . Which movie got and which movie  t got this magic all on the person who  s watching it , but I can easily say that you don  t have a clue about film if you say this movie . So no matter which movie genre is preferred by you , take my advice , watch this movie or you will miss out on a great part of ( now already ) film history . psi . I  m Dutch , so there  s my excuse for the odd grammar .",1
"we all love the daisy , but what is up with this cast . start , as Daisy , there is not one thing country about this girl and Daisy was not ! Uncle was probably the one to resemble the original . No offense to Burt , but I never Boss HOg being so tall . That was part of the humor of Boss Hog was his size . Did they even try someone like ?!? , now get this they cast did anyone take a look at her husband ? He Luke Duke to a tee !!!!!! these did not look at the appearance of the old cast . The screen t  s were never present on the !! This made the movie a turn off from the beginning . I give this a HUGE down .",1
"Well , for i haven  t seen much of with Jet Li . But if this film is any inkling about what kind of actor he is , then he IS the best actor from today . Even though it is for the great part of the movie just plain fighting . He a role that , and the movie it self by good story . And with supporting cast , as Morgan Freeman and Bob , this is one of 2005 best . Its got a surface of violence , but a heart of good and acting . This movie might just make grown men cry . For what it portrait in Jet Lis character , is a loss of , an childlike behavior , and lack of knowledge that just reach out into your chest . This is a must see !",1
"I  seen this movie and I want to say that it is a terrific comedy . For those who haven  t seen the movie , I recommend to watch it . I mostly like the , because they are so funny . But the other are funny as well . The subject is interesting , and the graphics are good . The way the are speaking make the movie way more funny and the more you  watched the movie , the more you want to continue watching . From all ,  s voice was the best . When you listen Rock speaking in a movie as a zebra , you will want to see the movie till it  s ended , and then , you feel sorry that it  t last longer . But , that  s it , and we must enjoy what we have so , what are you waiting for ? Go see the movie !",0
"The Director done it again , after the excellent Dog he again shown the how to make a great horror film . The Descent is a very clever film , it up the tension slowly then all hell on the viewer . It is a very jumpy film ! and a good that will have you thinking long after you have left the cinema . It is probably the best horror film I have seen since .... well since Dog ! to have had a bigger budget to work with Descent and he it to very good use , the are very well done without being too . My one small complaint is although the darkness of the underground to up the tension in the film it is however hard to follow some of the action . I had a similar complaint about Alien V Predator but this film is far superior to that one . You may think thats not saying much but I think was very harshly by the , but I do wonder what could do with an Alien film or a Predator movie . got a director for yet ? This man could do the job ! Is it better than Dog ? I  call it a draw . Roll on the next one , a World War movie ? That would be great .",1
"I am at how low the are for this movie . My least favorite movie of all time a higher score ( Blair Witch 2 ). But let me tell you , at no point was I to walk out of the theater - I almost every minute . I am 32 of age and the show when I was a - if you  t like the show , then I certainly  t waste your time with this movie . And if you are going to get upset because this is a sexually , NON - family movie , save your cash . The are a , moonshine - drinking , woman - chasing bunch . I definitely DO consider myself to be a movie snob - I appreciate good , and have become a huge fan of foreign / art . I  m not saying   is in the same as a really good movie - I certainly won  t be the - but don  t be automatically away by the terrible . And for what this is worth - the audience that I the movie with was laughing , clapping , and clearly the film . Happy !",1
"After hearing such great from everybody about this film , I can honestly say this is a film that I believe to have no to it . I watched it numerous and understood it , but it simply is horrible . I cannot fathom how so many people can think this film is a cult classic already . The acting is horrible , the story is weak and although it to be artistic , it does not accomplish it  s goal . It is a pretentious film that no merit . I always look for something good in a movie , but I could not find one good thing about this . It too hard and at everything . Please don  t rent this , it will be a waste of your time and money .",1
"Here is a classic zombie movie , where gore is back in the high seat . I Really this movie , not as good as Dawn or Night , but a big improvement over Day . I dug J . L . s character and basically .... no one else . Everyone in this movie I felt was flat , even Hopper who should have been a delight . The movie felt really short , it could have been a little bit longer , but that is not a complaint . My two main with this film were the ( with J . L . as an exception ) and their learning ability . There is one zombie a big black man who  t just ... or like other zombie  s , but he . They do learn , it  s just like Day of the Dead , you  see zombie  s shooting people with and gasoline to blow up . One character  They  re trying to be like us , like they use to be . They are trying to live again . I found that to be a bit annoying . Another little thing I it the  main  zombie was in the front line but was never shot , it was always the around him that , I found that to be far fetched . What did I like about it , the whole idea that they live in a new world that they built and they try to live in it , even with everywhere . What  s the very first thing you see ? A Zombie ... none of this how did it happen or character introduction , you get from the beginning . There is a lot of blood , yes there is a lot of blood , which was in a Romero film , but there were at least two very neat that I , mostly the throat ripping out through the mouth . I  d say it  s a better zombie edition then the as of late . up Romero , you still have it in ya . Yes , I saw and the two from of the dead . Which was great because my friend and myself were the only in the theater who cheered for them .",1
"After being told time and time again by my female to  watch The Notebook , you  cry much ! I finally did it , alone , in the privacy of my own home , so that if it was too terrible I could deny ever seen it later . It was almost exactly what I it to be . Boy from lower class girl from upper class , by , by chance later , girl to decide between the man she at 17 and her , who the world she   in . Sound familiar ? It should , it  s a plot that  s been worn thin through overuse , and a charming performance by is not enough to give it new life . Sparks , known mostly for for his even greater offender on the sentimental scene , A Walk to Remember , more interested in a tale that due to its predictability and tried - and - true appeal , not its originality or the freshness of dialogue , setting , or character . Despite showing a few impressive , Gosling to break out of the stock underdog role , and his distinctive only during the where he  s pitted against in their frequent , not during the love themselves . The real charm of this movie , for me , was the structure that the story is set against . An old man the story of the two young to an old woman suffering for the last of  s , a routine that we are given to understand every day . This elderly act of love is a thousand times and more convincing than any part of the story he -- though Sparks can  t resist tossing in further cheap sentiment by constant to an  miracle  that will cure his companion  s disease . Technically , the movie is impressive . The and are generally above par , but cannot save the movie from being a typical chick - flick tear jerker . It , certainly , but after watching it I felt the it  s received as  a perfect and enduring love story  was not fully deserved . In a few , it will still have its , but it will be to two in Blockbuster  s that get rented perhaps once a month , by similar that are again declared  beautiful and . The acclaim it  s popularly is , in my opinion , only because the of this film the story before they even the , and were to get exactly what they .",1
"As mediocre as the acting was the movie was all together good . Its a comedic action flick that the   feeling that the are so notorious for . I may not have chosen or for their , but when its all said and done i cant think of anyone else i would have picked . Call me a guy but cant act worth a lick , especially with her phony / real accent , but i  t paying close enough attention to any of that to make an actual judgment . Willie , is gorgeous like always been , the aside from their new age modification were nice . I give this film an 8 only because i cant give it a 7 . something . I  t by anything but it was fun to watch , and i uncontrollably several times . The from other new age cult were also very nice . also remember the show was nothing prolific . Both the movie and show are based on the same equation . Fast Car + Pretty Girl + Funny tight knit + Impossible car crash after impossible car crash = Good  time",0
"This film was a very pleasant surprise . It  s certainly different from every other Jet Li film I  seen . He to play to his - strong , silent and an utter nutter when it comes to a fight . The fight are far more enjoyable than anything I  seen in a great long time , none of the and poorly cut that seem to have almost all recent ( and the wonderful Batman ). This film  t just all slick fight though , it to portray a rather captivating emotional yarn as well . It  s not exactly a perfect or deep portrayal but it works well and is actually quite compelling . This film works and it works well and it is well worth watching .",1
"Dark Water  t necessarily a horror film supernatural . It could simply be the tale of a crazy woman whose mother was crazy , and whose daughter is also crazy . Think about that while you  re watching it . A ghost  t kill in the end , she suicide . Same as her mother did . And her daughter is still talking to an  imaginary friend . They  re , no involved . Another good  parallel theme  film is  s  Total Recall . You never know if ( ) is his virtual spy vacation or really saving from destruction . I found  Dark Water  to be much less subtle about the parallel . to  s state of mental health are made almost constantly throughout the film .",1
"very well done animation short . It was reminiscent of Ralph  s artistry . The was easy to follow . Story line geared towards , but I still found it entertaining and not  childish . I also the music . Zoom Suit is about an alien suit that is found in A crash in 1947 in New , then lost during a Military exercise . Switch to present day and a twelve year old who he  s found a costume . I  d be interested in future by , especially if they were more adult . By that I mean , if the story line is geared for , not . I  m going to look for the comic book as well .",1
"Who the have no humour ? They are just more subtle , and often their wit is easily mistaken for grave earnestness . An example might be the German lady who an general among the of Berlin in 1945 with the :  If only you had stayed out , none of this would have . That must have been a joke , right ? But now , all subtlety set aside , chosen to go all out with an unmistaken farce in  , about the last days of . Be prepared for side - splitting fun : two of suffering from the of their own .  wife cyanide into her five sleeping ( a gem ), a commander hand under his unsuspecting wife  s dinner table while soup is being , and himself ... well , , , and spring to mind as - up , but the cake . What a comedian ! I myself silly . Apart from that ,  s movie is well - and masterly executed . Besides obvious slapstick ( their brains blown out ), the film also more refined , such as the smoking who start out by smoking outside  s bunker in gentle deference to their non - smoking , and end up puffing away right outside his door , as his madness . Here comes the SPOILER : in the end . Definitely worth seeing ! ! If you want more material on German comedy I can recommend chapter of K .  s  Three Men in a Boat , on Professor  s great German comic song .",0
"I know many people have already written this movie off because it stupid or inane . While I  m not trying to defend this movie as some great work of cinematic genius , it is what it is , an entertaining movie . Most people might not want to see it because it  s a movie about by less than quality , or because it is untrue to the original series . If that  s the case , then don  t waste your time or money to see the movie only to gripe about it later . If you  re in the mood for a feel good movie with some alright action , a typical bombshell female role and entertaining , then I  m sure you  enjoy . Liking this movie  t mean your immature , all it if you enjoy a good time with some watching a movie you can laugh at later , unlike the erudite movie - that look down on this kind of genre because it a profound statement of humanity or moral character .",0
"I this movie was great and perhaps that  s why it left me so disappointed . Is there any fun in wasting half an hour with two boring and egoistic about their  poor  ? Bob is sad because he to make a whiskey spot in a foreign country and they are only paying him two million for that ! And the pretty girl .. she nothing to do but to flirt with middle aged men while his husband is working a lot to provide her with everything she . Oh , she tried to be a writer but she unable to write more than two together . And that  s all they do for 90 forgettable . I  m sorry for those who like this film because I found it only for a kind of hyper - sentimental , brainless person . There is NO plot at all , no meaning , nothing . At least he could have left her pregnant to expect a more exciting sequel . It  t surprise me when I in the that such a senseless film was made by a woman . Of course , no one would have given a penny for this terrible movie if it  t by her surname . Boring , depressing , stupid , slow , senseless , irritating . By the way , I dislike in general so I  t expect to find , special effects , or . Go an see some good cinema if you want deep and some meaning at the end , because this is a fraud .",0
"This movie certainly some beautiful scenery and cinematography , but those are the only high in this over - snooze - fest . Lost in Translation is yet another movie victim to deceptive . The for this movie made it look like a comedy with a plot , whereas the real movie is a - paced drama with a very loose plot . Two - faced with their wander around together and do random , at the end of the movie , rather than getting involved romantically , the two simply part ways and go back to their boring . ( I did like the fact that they loyal to their and did not have an affair ). My problem with this movie is that it was all style and no substance . Maybe if this movie had a and more intricate plot , and the would occasionally smile once in a while , or just show some emotion , maybe , I actually would have watching Lost in Translation . I certainly did not enjoy this movie , but if you are fascinated by   , you should give this a try .",1
"Gripping , spellbinding , and are a few of the I use to describe this film . Definitely worth twice the price I to view it . As a lover of action and psychological , this one is a wonderful example of both . I highly recommend this movie to anyone who to have their blood and experience hyperventilation as side effects in their movie . At first , I thought this was going to be all . It off a little slow , but I should have that was only temporary . Once the Chief  s coffee break was over , the movie took off like a rocket and stayed on full until the last 15 . I can  t wait to see what . for us the next time out , because he is definitely getting better with age , experience and creative control .",0
"This movie is so bad , the Cliff  s explaining just how bad it is would be an inch thick . Don  t go see it , don  t rent the . When the commercial for it your , change the channel quickly or risk permanent damage to your mind and the of your and . Yuck . Watch the series if you must . I watched it when I was much younger and admit that nostalgia was the key to my being into catching the new one . 1 . Burt was once A - list talent . Look into his . 2 . Willie Nelson is a legend in the music scene . Look into his music , even if you don  t like country -- I don  t enjoy the genre , but I like his stuff . 3 . is an attractive young woman . 4 . In my opinion , been funny in other . 5 . is that Jackass guy , right ? May the unquiet spirit of forgive them all .",1
"don  t take your to this movie because the only good part about it is half naked . , . the movie itself had an extremely weak plot with some decent car . general lee was looking beautiful and and stifler deliver and performance . Burt will melt your face with his pimp and p . totally unbelievable sideburns . the plot itself  t seem to make much sense just little with Willie nelson to be a walking anti - drug scare advertisement . to end the summary i recommend that you go out to a music store and buy the chariot  s because that is way better than this movie . also , is hot .",0
"This is my biggest sticking point with this movie . Was the subplot ? I know it that could be dangerous and added to the mystery of  s psychoses , but why was  s character crying at the end ? Had he also been saved by  s sacrifice and would now give up this wicked ways ? Or was he crying for his own wickedness ? I know it added another level to this film , and Frank  s advice to burn down the house to be based on moral thereby showing the Frank / relationship to be based on good not evil . But I still feel was a subplot too far . What do you think ?",1
"This movie is seriously boring . Seriously . I know it  s meant to be magical and inspiring and fun . But it  s not . Then again , if you like and , if you don  t mind from the grave , if you have no problem with some wooden trying to act , if you think a story - line can be made out of sticks and if you think  magic  of a fluffy fat dog on stage and a guy dancing with his dog , then by all , go and see it . If you think you will get a Burton dish , you  re wrong . long since lost my vote . Never mind . The young promising actor boy ... all the best to him but I get the - - - already ( lay off of those !). I hope I do not sound bitter . It  s just that I so much more . And it was not . If you are like me and you watched this movie , you will know what I mean ...",0
"This movie although I give it 10 out of 10 it still was just not properly . M . C . as was good only because he his dog flash other than that he just did not act like . Burt as Boss was not that great and good of used some work . They should have shaved his head , lost the beard , and put him in a fat suit . and were terrible as the duke they just did not look the part . Nelson as Uncle was decent enough . as was good , but not great . I am glad that Cooter was in the movie and we even saw and as . That should have been all the law enforcement they had since that was all they had in the original series . All in all the best character in this entire movie was the car The General Lee .",0
"I went in not knowing what to expect ... especially after Cursed ( which was a more entertaining movie the second time around with the gore intact ). Red Eye was one of the most entertaining I have sat through in a really long time . I would even pay to see it when it is actually because I it that much . I have not been to a movie where the crowd was cheering , screaming , and the screen so much . The were terrific ... the plot was interesting , the tension was riveting ... all in all , a great summer movie worth your money ! GO see it !",0
"Saw this movie during the last month at a premiere - and , originally , was not much - discovered some interesting and throughout the movie . Much is being made about the to the 70  s genre of - which I would agree to the overall concept - same kind of as you would see in and the 13th - without the jumpy slice and dice . Other I would add to the mix would be Craven  s  The Serpent and the Rainbow  - with the same mix of voodoo and in that vein . an excellent , thoughtful turn in the movie - and well - through - out . All I can say is take the movie in - without trying to figure out the answer to the puzzle - and let the show wash over you . You will find the story quite satisfying ...

"When I used to think of what made a good movie , I would look at a movie from all : direction , cinematography , , acting , story . The sum of all these make up the whole , and are also what lead me to my opinion of a film ... Then came Lost in Translation . The first time I watched this movie , I felt a strange sense of depression that for a few days , but I  t put my finger on why . I watched it again and again , and felt the same way each time . I thought maybe it was because I have never traveled and would really like to , or that I have the desire to find the perfect woman in a strange world . Whatever the case , I one thing . LOST IN TRANSLATION MADE ME THINK . It made me question my life , its purpose , whether I was happy or not , and what I want do with it . Never a movie touched me in such a way , and for that reason , this is the one of the I have ever seen . That  t mean its the best movie ever made , in fact , I can name many that are technically better than this film , like the one I before . But I cannot name a movie that had more effect on me than Lost in Translation , and that is why I love it and will love it forever . Think of the last movie that really made you think , one that had such a great influence on you that it somehow your life , even for the bit . That , to you , is a great movie ...",1
"Ben been making a lot of noise about how the new film adaptation very little resemblance to the original The of television series . I  m not sure he that he  s inadvertently praising the film in the process , though . Anyway , I saw it this afternoon . is right . It  s basically a and re - telling of the  tale \u0097 the only which remain intact are the and the setting .  s Luke Duke and  s Bo Duke are much more like the good  I  always in the South than and Schneider ever were . They  re careless , a little stupid , and work  blue  through most of the movie . The rest of the cast is a little stiff , although I applaud the for not trying to pick new and force them to re - act the show  s of their respective . The P . of the film is plain mean , where he was just a idiot in the show . Burt  interpretation of the Boss character was likewise much colder and devious than  s character , making him a lot easier to root against . The only real in the new casting were as Daisy Duke ( she  s certainly no Bach ) and Willie Nelson as Uncle , neither of whom fully the warmth and good nature inherent to their . Still , Willie Nelson  s one - ( as out of step with the script as they were ) were often hilarious . Finally , there  s the flag . The Confederate flag . People are this film because of a flag painted on top of a car ! Despite the fact the film the flag  s ugliness on several , often with a self - aware tongue - in - cheek sense of humor , the people who are causing a stink about it will never know .

As I said in the Summary , A Very Good Film but .... the movie had a lot of and they say it is a family movie . The life of is very complicated and I  t want to be one .

"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of is part of the highest caliber in literature . One that not only to every age group ; but with an excellent full of plot and imagination . This book is part of the current most popular book series that possibly ever . It is that the film interpretation of this book would be critically with cleverness and great appeal to all . Unfortunately this is not the case . Harry Potter and the Prisoner of is directed by Alfonso . After the first two were directed by it that were not good enough for the plus - 10 million that he was being . This turned out to be a dreadful mistake on Warner part . Alfonso was definitely the bad choice to head the million dollar production that is  The prisoner of . It is still why was hired for this job with his mere being several low budget , The Little Princess and the very disturbing Y Tu . brought his very unusual of to the mix . He very unusual and a sub - par interpretation that would make writer J . K . ashamed . He  t bring the appropriate seriousness to the film as it often like a joke . The film with Harry Potter ( ) now 13 old , starting his third year at . The world been shaken up , due to the recent escape of Black from the prison of . The significance of Black is that he was the person of leading the dark Lord to Harry  s . It is that he is bent on finishing his task by killing Harry as well . to Harry  s are phantom like . These heartless are sent to guard from Black . With all the stress of these terrifying and the person who gave away his location which lead to their death ; Harry become angry . No longer a helpless child Harry grown up to become a and more powerful person . Harry with his two best ( ) and ( Emma ) to continue the of School . Harry is by the new defense against the dark teach Professor ( ) to learn to defend himself against Black and the treacherous . Harry  t ever seem to catch a break as his only get worse . The movie overall is decent , the acting is surprisingly good for the young and the more experienced , Alan , Smith and all do terrific of their . However after the death of the role of Dumbledore was given to . however does in my opinion an inaccurate portrayal of the Headmaster failing to show the wisdom and care that brought to the screen . Even so his in the book are minimal as he does not affect the film in a big way . The effects in this movie are excellent as the visual effects seem to get better and better . The realism in the broomstick flying and the are phenomenal and the effects team a pat on the back . Overall this movie is worth seeing for any Harry Potter fan , and should appeal for the average person to see it at least once . Unfortunately is like the opportunity to make a great film was by Director Alfonso and it is disappointing to watch and think  what could have been a great movie",0
"This movie was awesome . The was great ... it never dragged . Also , it was hilarious , and the car were a lot of fun . Very much stayed true to the  of  series I , and it  s always a pleasure to see Willie Nelson on screen . I that one of the original cast about the movie being too sexual . Yes , it is sexual , but so was the original ! It was never the  family  show that people are it once was . Also , the cast member who made that comment was later revealed to have for the movie and been turned down , so take what he said with a grain of salt . If you want deep drama , don  t see this movie . But if you want to have a great time and don  t take yourself too seriously , this flick  s for you !",0

The whole gang is here ---- Cooter , Boss , Daisy , Bo , Luke , Uncle , . The were GREAT . The movie was hilarious . What else can I say ? A great movie , great cast and the at the end of the movie when the go up are just as funny as the movie ! You have to stay and watch the !",0
"such Stone , , Colin , , , Plummer and Rosario in the cast ; a great theme ; and a huge budget , I could never expect that   could be a boring movie .

The camera close - up most of the times and countless number of . with a ridiculous accent and I do not know what the intention of such behavior is . The free exploitation of and homosexual clearly the intention of raising a polemic theme to get the of the media and call the attention of the public in general .

A very good horror film , much better than the ring , with a lot of spooky , specially the bed sequence , you  re not forget that , believe me . 8 / 10",1
"Its somewhat difficult to regard this film as a black comedy so to speak since the humor is far too light and abundant , however in it ( very little ) are some rather serious and touching . Steven Chow does a fine job of and to make this hodgepodge of  Looney  humor , added with a touch of and  Matrix  work .

"I thought this movie was excellent . Obviously this is a light summer movie that  t supposed to be like winning or anything but it  s great for a good laugh . If you are looking for an intelligent movie this  t the right one for you . and are the pair I  seen in a long time . They are so believable as Bo and Luke Duke . is pretty good as well . She made an excellent Daisy Duke , I don  t think anyone else could have done better . I haven  t that hard in a long time . I recommend it for sure and I am no doubt going to see this one at least one or two more times !",0
"This movie one element that  s been missing in for quite a while now : FUN . This  t Citizen . This  t Star . This is a sit back , relax , and enjoy some free - spirited excitement . It was refreshing to see how ( ) and Jackass ( ) each worked their comedic . gave us a few Jackass style . gave quite a few Pie sex - related . As for keeping with the style and feel of the original show : not really . BUT the car are exciting and the General Lee incredible . Daisy Duke is amazing ... looking . It was fun seeing the from the show ( , , Cooter , ..) on the big screen . Some older will get a kick out of ( Wonder Woman ), Willie Nelson , and The Bandit himself : Burt . I can  t express how refreshing a fun movie is during a time period of massive right wing oppression and the  media  telling us daily that we could all die tomorrow .",0
"A fine acting job by the / were ruined by the s - l - o - w pace of the movie . It took forever for to happen . At many in the movie you are just watching Bill gaze off into space for what like eternity . No dialogue , no movement . Just nothing . I know this in real life , but in 105 minute movie ; 20 - 30  t be spent on absolutely nothing . Bill , his role brilliantly , to this slow paced feeling . He very little , his do his talking and when he does talk he no affect . The one person who added a little life to the movie was Wright , who turned in a credible role as the friend / neighbor . The bottom line is don  t see the movie if you are tired . The may put you to right to sleep .",0

The script was terrific and the was top notch too . Kudos to Mike Binder !! All people have happen to them ... that  s a fact .

It was very exciting , hilarious , and lots of fun to watch , just like the show .  t be more perfect in this film - she is by far the girl on this universe , and every straight man in the world will love how holy crap oh my god sexy she is . This movie was great , and the at the end cracked everyone up in the theater . There were some that were a little up . There were never that many police in the show for . Secondly , the shower scene at the beginning where Uncle was walking in on Daisy was really corny . I knew she  t going to be naked or actually ; her were round and tight through the shadow through the shower curtain , and they would be hanging down because she  s so sexy , if she was really .

I don  t mind a skinny boss hog or a blonde daisy duke . The in this movie give their own up to date spin of the in county and pull it off very well .

"This movie no plot , it  s just a story about screwed up people in suburbia . There really  t much more to say as far as the plot goes . It  s random , it  s disturbing , it  s stupid , and ultimately it  t make any damn sense and nothing . I haven  t a film like this in quite a long time ! And I think quite possibly this is the worst independent film I have ever seen . I went to the theater knowing nothing about the movie other then the huge array of positive Roger who the film to be smart and original . What was wrong with this movie you may ask ? I don  t even know where to begin ! First off the movie off by not explaining anything . Why are the getting a divorce ? Why do the hate the dad ? No character development at all ! That  s the big problem to start off with . Then they have these sick like the horny child molester and the little sick who dirty to an older woman . I mean who wrote this pile of crap ! Who to make a scene where two little are talking to an older lady in a sex chat talking about you Poop in my butt and I will poop in your butt and we will keep doing it forever . I mean was a sick 6 year old responsible for writing this script . In fact what script was there even one !? I love weird , I love controversial , I love twisted , but this movie is just a piece of garbage ! Who would release something like this ! I mean I have never seen a film that offended me so much not only because of the content but because there is no point at all . Child are A - in this movie ! An older lady talking sexual to a little 6 year old A - ! Why ? Who ! Nothing is ! I do not understand what movie are watching when they watched this film because all I see was crap , a big pile of crap ! No substance , no nothing . This  t how suburbia is , if that  s what its suppose to be , show me where that is happening in the real world , please ! It  s not this is garbage off as an art film . I have nothing at all positive to say about this film ! The writer and director should never ever be to touch a keyboard or typewriter again ! This is the worst pile of crap I have seen in a long time ! Don  t trust the on this one seriously ! They must have been smoking crack or got by the studio to give this movie a positive review ; there is nothing at all good about this film . This movie no point , no morals , no story , and no direction . Nothing ! AVOID AT ALL !  s final rating for the hunk of crap known as Me You and Everyone We Know is a 1 / 10",0

So I rented it and found it to be a very good and entertaining film . was awesome as always and ( at least I think it was him ) made a short appearance too . All in all , it  t a bad movie , although I  t compare it Harry Potter as some people have . I really hope they make a second follow - up movie to it doing four , five , and six . I believe it definitely that . If you want a new kind of movie to see with your or family , I recommend this one . Hope you e",1
"From the camera and cinematography to the inspired score , this is clearly an ode to , and a damn good one at that . Bale a lonely factory worker whose life is slowly unraveling due to lack of sleep . In his state of half waking / half sleep , nightmarish paranoia and a creepy mystery lead our protagonist down a highway to damnation ... or perhaps salvation . There  s lots of clever little to both literary and . of  Memento ,  Fight Club , and Lynch abound , but what this film rise above a simple amalgamation of previous in the genre is the go - for - broke performance from Bale . He literally made himself look like a Holocaust victim for the sake of the art .  If you were any thinner you  t exist , people keep telling him . Physically , emotionally , and mentally , a man by guilt never before been more blazingly on screen .",1
"Obviously the director was more interested in show how empty his life was at 50 . Unfortunately , without some kind of back story , I found it really hard to believe he had Stone , , and hot for him in a 5 - 6 month period when he was 30 . I to see some spark of something that made him attractive to these fabulous ( he  t rich at 30 ), but I  t see it . What exactly did and girl ( and even the flower girl at the cemetery ) see in him at 50 ? I first thought maybe the to Don and Don were supposed to gentle put against a guy that obviously did not fit the bill . But every character did think was quite the stud with a big rep . Maybe that  s the look for 2005 : a , slug in a polyester sweat suit .",0
"I  so much about this  Wonderful , mind blowing masterpiece  . Interestingly enough most of the rave of came via this very which goes against the grain of other . Roger only gave the movie two and a half while many other to film claim this movie is confused and . It should also be that if it  s such a great , thought provoking piece of cinema then why did it miss out on so many at the more prestigious film award ? And don  t say politics , an independent feature like IN THE BEDROOM  t pick up any but that  t stop it being nominated for is by no terrible but it is . Dare I say it  s a case of the new clothes ? That is people are somewhat embarrassed upon seeing this film and not understanding it that they feel they must praise it in order to spare their supposed ignorance . Let me ask you this - What genre of film is this ? Everyone will give a slightly different answer I  m sure and if an audience is undecided about the genre then how can they decide what the ending is about ? And there is a quite serious plot hole involved in the story . a demonic rabbit Frank throughout the movie who him at exactly what moment the world will end . , time may actually exist in scientific reality as may the ending but the central plot does not since the whole movie on Frank or being able to see into the future and no scientist will claim there  s any scientific basis for fortune telling . So you see it  s not really about time travel , it  s about mysticism , predestination and other superstitious jumbo which Kelly is to fool the audience . In effect this movie is one big cheat and most people have to notice this said that Kelly does deserve some credit for making a movie that  s not about car and , this is a movie dealing with teen angst and the dark side of middle small town but Kelly an opportunity to make the most of the potential . I know the film was before the war on terror so there  d be little need to see news on the fall out of the original Gulf war but from a pop culture point of view  t this have been better set in the early 1990s when culture was the rage instead of 1988 ? I mean what music best this movie  s atmosphere ? Echo And The or Nirvana ? In fact if it had have set in the presidential of early 1990s this would have coincidentally tied in with what  s going on in the world today with and getting a mention ! And  t this movie be up in superstitious awe now ? As it it  s nowhere as clever as it it is for the outlined . Perhaps Kelly out on with two , one a high concept science fiction thriller and the other a low concept drama about a mentally ill and decided to merge the two with not too successful . Watching this was the gut feeling I got",1
"of Troy  a very stunning film , which was directed by Kent , is a story which mainly on romance , action , drama and adventure . It was first last 20 , 2003 . This motion picture was actually a re - enactment of a kind of myth . Originally it was taken from the Mythology and it is an exclusive version taken from Homer  s .  A face that a thousand . This is the main essence of the story of Troy . Literally every man , even her brother Pollux , fell in love with her because of her incomparable beauty . But little do they know that being and  daughter , this woman thus wrath to people  s . Thus , a ten year conflict was . Although were also shown during the whole conflict , each man  s desire to have the most beautiful wife on earth still , therefore leading to their own demise . Men their braveness and their loyalty to their land . They fought all the way through just to attain their goal in . But in doing so , their egoism still stood out . For instance , King led his people to Troy thus making him look brave and heroic . But little do his men know about his hidden agenda in getting back not for his brother , , but for his own pleasure and contentment . In overall evaluation , the film in my opinion should be rated 4 out of 5 . The major concept of the story was successfully shown through the dialogue of the . The / were just right for their role in their assigned . However , the cinematography could have been better in of better lighting and more sound effects for the to truly grasp the essence of the film . But generally it is an excellent film that should be watched by everyone who to be and be familiar with Homer  s .",1
"I guess it  s more fun making some than watching them . You get to go on location , eat and drink at the producer  s expense , have a great time . I don  t know if Bill just sitting and staring , but he  s to do it . The , on the other hand ,  t get the money , travel , eat , drink and fun . In fact , we had to pay , which is painful . So we would like something back for our nickle ( hah !). Paying to watch these dish out crap with no intention of entertaining , , or doing anything for the is a joke , on us , the . All this thing did was bore us . Well , they had their fun at our expense . Will there be a consequence ?  t seem like it . They  just go ahead and make another  art film  and the will it to death , and we  go see it and complain again . Why ? Because we  re stupid ? No , because we have more faith in the goodness of human nature than these con have .",0
"This movie was the biggest LET DOWN and WASTE of TIME ever ... It  t even have the same feel as Romero  s . I have been waiting for the movie to come out ever since it was , been a fan of his work . I could not believe the incredibly bad , casting , and overall texture of the film . Even the Remake of DAWN of the DEAD this unholy piece of crap . Although if anyone out there is a fan of  s work then they should surely enjoy this video game form of narrative . The teaser for this flick was better than the whole film .",1
"What can one say of this film ? Any adjective would be an understatement . It is great how this stellar cast together and this story yet their own experience to the mix . The use of imagination is nothing short of genius . It works on all from the ground up . The painted by the are so vivid and captivating that you can  t help but to experience it as if you were there . A classic tale of struggle and opportunity . A whirlwind ride for the whole family . Something for everyone . It  s great to see a timeless treasure , such as this story , finally with the world . I would definitely see this again . There is just so much to absorb . It would take a plethora of paper to do the job . A most uplifting experience .",0

"Last week , our class watched the movie of Troy . The first thing that I was it was a long movie ( 175 ). of Troy was in the year 2003 , to life the famous poem The written by Homer . It was produced by Ted and was directed by Kent . This adventurous / tragic epic the story of the battle between the and the . It the complexity of the and in the story . One of the visible shown in the movie was the difference of the relationship of and between that of Hector  s and .  s and  relationship was more like that of a leader - servant . being the commanding older brother while being the submissive one . On the other hand , Hector  s and  was more of the brotherly type . They each other and even if they  t often show it they worried for the other  s welfare . The distinction of the two was clearly seen in the fight between and .  t care if his brother would be unlike Hector who even his life for the sake of . For , he valued his life more than his brother  s while for Hector he valued his brother  s life more than his own . All in all , the movie was an effective adaptation of the poem . The crew used that are similar to the period when the story was made . They have shown successfully the idea of what it would be like during those times . Also , the were perfect for their . They different such as anger , irritation and empathy from their audience \u0096 a clear sign that they did a good job . They also did a good job in and the movie , only the important were included . The only negative aspect of the movie that I saw was the incomplete portrayal of some of the like . All considered , my final rating for the movie is 4 .",0

Oh GOd , whoever made this movie don  t have a clue on whats going on . , I lived in for 20 , and people don  t even look like that . is a city of like 6 million , with , and subway system . And what the hell was that language , you people , maybe should watch a little bit more from or , they have good on like that . And wait a minute , the great pyramid , even Napoleon to do it , what a bad taste . I realize that making a spoof is funny , they obviously got jealous of thunder so thats the reason for this move . BAD BLOODY TASTE .",0

"of Troy , made in 2003 , was a movie by Kent who also directed the Hallmark novel - turned - into - - series A Wrinkle In Time . It was also produced by Ted , unit production manager of Phone Booth ( 2002 ). The movie was 175 . Our class it from 28 , 2005 until August 2 , 2005 in forty minute sessions . The movie was an adaptation of The by poet , Homer . , daughter of and , was the face that a thousand . She was married to King , but ran away with the enemy , the prince , . intended to get her back but his brother , , had bigger . The ulterior motive of the war was Troy , in actuality . The movie , Pollux  s ,  the madness that in men . , power , wealth and glory these were the actual of the war . In the course of watching the movie , my were . I  t appreciate the . For example , the , who were the driving force of the war , was not shown . , in the text , was cowardly but in the movie , he was this valiant prince who was a better warrior than Hector . Ridiculous ! was not as the atrocious warrior that he should have been but more of a love - struck . the depth . He more like a wrestler rather than a man of divine heritage . Another disappointment was the complete disregard for King begging for the return of his son  s , Hector , cadaver . It was a moving scene but it was completely wasted away by of Troy . Though , Rufus was a very effective , in my opinion . He was as the savage warrior who would do anything , even kill his own progeny , for the sake of glory . I also have to give kudos to of Troy shining light to the other such as , and . In general , the were inconsistent , ineffective and forgettable with the exception of . They the depth and substance . The effects were low budget but understandable considering it  s a - movie unlike the film , Troy ( 2004 ). Sound effects were nothing special . The cinematography was cheesy especially during the fight but was great during the sacrifice of . Altogether , I would give the film 2 out of 5 .",1
"in nationwide on 29 , 2004 . I figured my dad and I would watch it just in time for . It to us that this would be another entertaining thriller , living up to our .  Saw  unleashed something far more on the contrary than what we . Simply , it  s about two men hostage by a madman in a room with a dead body between them . They must find a way out while one of them been given the burden to murder the other . Throughout the film , you understand what the so -  killer  done to other people . He them to play lethal of survival to appreciate life . Not many of them live to tell the tale , so you can understand how mad really is . arise between the two men in the room as they struggle to stay alive and outwit their . You find out that the and the  title character  are far different than ordinary .  s killing are much more unique since he does not in fact do the personally . If you  re open minded enough , you might appreciate the effort that the did to film such a unique picture . Although it  s entirely graphic and maybe unbearable to watch , it you to get an idea of how the in the film felt .  Saw  put so much adrenaline into me , I  t believe that the were able to pull off something like that . This horror / thriller is worth watching and over and over because of its many and . Even today ,  Saw  my blood with fear , my with shock , and my pulse with excitement . Many have this movie for the many the film leaves behind at the end . But that  s why  Saw  is nearly in production . I hope this comment was useful to some of you . I completely recommend watching it ; you won  t be disappointed .

My husband could hardly wait for this , he was such a fan , he his dog , . Would the movie do justice to the book ? Would it stay true to the story ? In my opinion , it not only did both , but enhanced my vision of how the story should be told . The were more real , the scenery incredibly vivid . The only problem I had with the was how strong the of the nasty were . I to go back to the cozy in the Shire . While my husband all three , I found I the first one better than the second .

"of Troy :  s Greed of Troy is a film that the story of Homer  s . Directed by J .

My and I , however , watched it on ( from Universal Home Video ) last week ( 25 \u0096 August 5 , 2005 ) during our classes . The whole film is 175 long . It was about the fate of ,  s bastard , who was the root of the War and the Fall of Troy . The film with a childish feud between the , and who were fighting over  Golden Apple of Discord that was marked For the . advised them to go to the who was said to have a remarkable taste for beauty .

Instead of making peace , triggered the conflict by to Troy making the think that their queen was . This the and then the War . won the ten - year war and was . Troy was and was back , all right , but many innocent were wasted . The war would have ended peacefully if to the Commander - in - Chief , . In the film , she gave herself up but  t surrender . Note the of  - psychic half sister to ,  You gave yourself up but you  t surrender , did you ?!.  t surrender because she  t yield to the or even abandoned her love for . What she did was definitely unacceptable for .  s greed to save Troy . Beyond the fact that the story was well written , the direction was laudable . The director was able to pull out from every actor the right emotion that each to play . Actor Rufus who the evil and lustful so well that he was able to make everyone in our class despise him . The use of computer - graphics ( ) on the was a wise move . It the save money and time in the film . Although I believe that there is more to computer effects , the use of was not that bad . The sound effects  t that bad either . Overall , I give the movie 3 . 75 out of five . It  s not a movie that I will eagerly watch but it  s good enough to see with other about the especially when you  re after a more accurate account of the epic .",1
"Curiously anaemic that works hard to deliver little . There  s definite promise in the early where the young comes across as a with the waitress and you wonder how this particular shade of character will be with all the other still to be painted in . But then . . . there  t any more . The script any notion of complexity and instead into neutral , leaving all concerned to do their best with an acting vehicle that never once off the ground . is too canny a director not to know when  t working out , but there  s real desperation here in the extended aircraft crash sequence , as blatant a case as ever there was of special effects being rushed in to enliven a movie that  s lost its way as well as its pace . Shame . It could , and should , have been so much , much better .",1
"The story about the thin line between greatness and evil dictatorship is told in an excellent way surrounded by great action , drama , , ... Again a masterpiece of a director who what are mend to be . This 3 movie felt as if its duration was about an hour . The fact that most negative refer to the character of that the actor did a great job in a narcissistic stiff - head with great mental power and vision . Kept me thinking for several days and I  m still myself why the movie does not the it . Is it too shocking to see a hero who  s taste and value  s do not comply with archetype of super man ?",0

"In connection with mythology , our class was given the opportunity to view the film , of Troy , last 26 to August 2 , 2005 . of Troy , during the year 2003 , is a movie produced by Ted and directed by Kent . It was based on Homer  s   and its primary focus is  The War , which is one of the in Ancient Literature . The film the story of , the most beautiful woman in the world , being married to in a land . When Prince comes to seek peace with , madly in love with him and him to Troy . Enraged , upon the army to fulfill the oath they once swore : to defy anyone who stole . From thus , the battle for  s love was , the of many great at stake . Although , the story a different plot from the text , people who haven  t read it would be able to grasp the main idea from the movie . I was disappointed by the way the the character of , especially his line :  I stand before High King . was not under anyone , not even the highest of ; he for his own skin and fought for his own glory . Making him faithful to and responsible for no one else was a mistake because it to show there were no other people involved who concerned . I also did not like the reason the made for killing Hector . According to the text , Hector to avenge his best friend  s death \u0096 not to save . Another significant difference was begging for the body of Hector from , which was wrong ; I believe it  s important that , Hector  s father , was the one who for his son  s body from because it that despite all the people , there was still compassion left in the heart of even the most ruthless warrior . What worked particularly well for the film was the focus on  s royal family ; it a lot about  s background , thus giving the audience more information than in the text . I give this movie , a final rating of 4 . The setting , effects and the cinematography was great . It made me feel as if it  s the exact place where the battle . of Troy is a movie that immediately its audience , engraving into their hearts the message it to impart , which is : there will always be people who are ready to fight , whether it be for love of country , love of glory , or simply loving someone .",1
"With more than a touch of  It  s a Wonderful Life  and  , albeit with a decidedly odd twist , Kelly  s debut feature is a clever and thought - provoking piece of - fi .

Add to this bodily carving out each person  s path through life , a mad old lady always her mailbox , , Graham  s classic short story  The , a creepy self - help guru ( by ), and a girl dance troupe , and gel it all together with an 80s score and that famous cover of  Mad World , and you have a recipe for success . But does it work ? From the strange opening premise , as destruction comes to the house in the form of a fallen jet engine , through to the bleak and finale , it  s a valiant try , but for all it  s good , it a little sterile and undeveloped .

"I  m here to say that I  t care if gayness or not . I know enough of history to know that of the culture . I  m here to say the movie was bad . Even Stone knew it as he out for the director  s cut . The narrative and around constantly , all the stay at arms length , the battle are very few and poorly done , and comes off as a tyrant conquering the poor ignorant for their own good while nothing of the of his men . His claim to have everything with his men comes off cold and his to bolster his men  s courage come off as patronizing . It may be just my personal dislike that the are all either boring or stiff , but the cut of the movie is horrid . From  s youth to his teens , to the last battle with ( for all and ) then when you think another gorilla war will take the movie is found dead . True to history , yes , dramatic ? no ! Stone to be around trying to cover this and that with no idea how to edit down the movie to a dramatic core . Even when are unmasked it ahead to their execution . Every time the scene I wonder where we are off too . The past ? present ? future ? of this film need to stop blaming the right for some anti - gay conspiracy . It  s just a bad movie from a guy who can often cross the line between brilliant and awful .",1
"It  t matter who my Father was ; It who I remember He was  ( S .) of Troy is mainly a tragic movie tinted with romance , which was in 2003 . produced a 175 - minute movie , which I eagerly watched in the last week of . The most famous author of this mythological story is Homer . The movie is taken from Homer  s epic ,  The  and this specific part is about a ten year war that was fought by both men and , between the and the because of the most beautiful woman in the world , . The movie in ,  s homeland , and already , lust is in the atmosphere as seen in most male but most especially , in ,  s brother - in - law and the High King of . He was to be the worst villain in the movie because not only did he kill his daughter , , to sail to Troy , bully his little brother and cheat but he also and in front of , the loving husband . Thus , a lot of think that is as evil as can be but I dare to disagree . Even though his daughter to pursue his ambition , it could not be that he for his daughter . The only time you see him sincerely smile is when he with his daughter , when he spent time with her in the garden . Also , before killing her , he a moment to think and  t immediately say yes to the  demand . Then after he his daughter , you see him shaken and unstable for a moment . He also got hurt . Later in the movie , during his conversation with , you can see that in his stone heart , there is still a soft spot for his daughter . Other than a mad man , he was also a father in whom his daughter would feel such happiness and safety in his arms . The acting , sound effects and lighting was praiseworthy although I was not particularly happy with the script because I felt that the romantic were forced into a very tragic movie . In the end , I really the movie , especially the fight and because it made you think . I would rate this movie a nine . I firmly believe it  s worth watching !",0
"a reputation for being a seriously strange film ; but in some ways , it  s undeserved . This is not just to say that it is fundamentally very conventional with the work of the of ; it  s actually far coherent than many science fiction ( for example ,  Open My , or it  s remake ,  Vanilla Sky , which where simply for their   ); or horror like the  Ring  cycle . My guess is that were thrown primarily because of the of genre ; supernatural , are simply not supposed to appear in what is partly a teen movie , and partly a suburban satire . As a straight film ,    t bad : all the sympathetic are unnaturally beautiful , of course , and there are the customary easy at educational ( to a , this recurrent aspect of teen is very strange , can they really be so prevalent to deserve this amount of attention ?); but there  s some nice dark comedy , and the acting and are generally of a high standard . It even to possess a good 1980s ( in my opinion , quite an achievement in itself !). As science fiction , on the other hand , it some resemblance to  s book ,  in a Coma  ( and indeed , much more sense than that book did ). What it  t give us is any indication of why the we see should happen to its hero ; the film may be sensible , but it  s also essentially meaningless . Nonetheless , it  s intelligently made , distinctive , and not really that , providing you leave your at the cinema door .",1

Watching for never less what the story was . then i had the urge to watch . The main picture of frank was like an intense calling to me , so i gave it a what a shot it was ! It is without a doubt the best cinema experience i have ever had . Now let me clear this up , it is not the best film i have ever seen ( pretty close though ) but the best cinema experience . The perfect musical score running through the , giving me at certain of the film . getting this on was good , but seeing this film in cinema just divine . There is probably enough on her telling you how good the film is so let me just say they are right . It is not a film for everyone , some will hate it , some will love it ( like that stupid crap mar - mite ). For some the aspect of this film is so profoundly that i have spent many days explaining it to . But the film is , as it is supposed to be , this is not a clear cut blockbuster , direct line throughout the film , this is supposed to make you think , feel , it will make you use a range of in such a short period of time . Watching this film in the cinema my on and i will never have the same experience as i did with this film . Kelly , you bow to no - one !",1

It  s fun and he perfectly . despite the fine acting all around , one of my favorite of the film was the terrific original jazz by , which was as much a part of the motion picture as the dialogue .",1
"The movie a very   plot that automatically everything that in it to make no sense whatsoever . Sure , you don  t expect a masterpiece story line in a horror movie , but come on , this one like a very bad ghost story you would laugh at by the camp fire . So basically what you have here is a pile of supposedly creepy of worn out of zombie looking , , something that like hair i suppose it was , you have some and sound effects to amplify the level of senselessness . I guess the assumed it would be scary since people are supposed to be what they don  t understand and rationally explain . Well , not here . Yes I admit , some might creep you out on occasion , but it becomes obvious quite quickly that the extremely poor plot is just a cheap excuse to put a bunch creepy in the movie . Nope ,  t work , because what perfectly up creepy , is the creepy story . But I guess we  t have both . I don  t know . Maybe I  m too demanding . Maybe a bit of effort is too much to ask these days . Maybe I  been too much Silent Hill ( because that , although not a movie , is a perfect combination of extremely creepy story and creepy , and the  fear of the unexplained  theory works perfectly there ). Not a good movie . I  give it 3 zombie up .",1

It was good and all but it that in the wake of 9 - 11 for the most part that everyone now is a terrorist and must use that in their to make people come and see them . I don  t get it .

Violence a very big part in  Sin City . There  s stabbing , shooting , , the electric chair , castration , gang - style .. it  s all in there so don  t say i  t warn you .

"This  t going to be a review as such , rather just my towards this film . This will probably help no one , but I feel I have to say something so I can move on to other , better . I can  t deny that this movie is well made . It good , its well ( even if Bullock is too much of a personality and out too much ), and its one of the rare out today that a point of view . But for all the I can  t say I like the film or even admire it on anything other than a technical level . I don  t like being to . I don  t like how it so carefully and artfully put together that it more like a sermon rather than a movie . Sure its premise , simply put , that racism us all , and that some can over come it is true , but by the end of the movie I was left feeling unmoved and the screen  yes , and ? The film to be trying to take a high ground and say that it better than all of us . Somehow I don  t think so . This movie made me feel the same way that a play Spinning into Butter made me feel . Spinning into Butter is by and is in the process of being made into a movie . The play with racism on a small New college campus . The center piece of the play is what is essentially a 20 minute monologue that racism down so narrowly that it up that if you don  t sit next to a person of a different race on a train / subway car , even if its completely empty except for the two of you then you are a racist . Many in the audience were by this . And equal number of the audience were left shaking our in disbelief since the play essentially all are racial . I left the play , as I left the theater showing this movie admiring that they got so much right , but feeling that at the point at which they got on the soap box they lost me and I was never able to fully accept their premise . As well made and on target as the film is , its by the film need to climb onto that soap box . I  m left not wanting to ponder the out for myself , rather I want desperately to ask them  yes , and your point was what ?. Actually my feeling is more a happiness that now that I  seen it , I never have to see it again .",1
"is a supreme talent in horror that should not be , especially by who did just that with Dog and is it with The Descent , both of which have not had US cinema For his second movie he  s decided to stay with horror but this time dropping the fun factor and on pure horror , scare tactics and something he  s proving to excel in , a very strong and realistic script . Something that hit me during the early of the all female climbing group sitting in their cabin chatting , is the realism of their vocabulary and delivery . It  s something that was obvious in Dog as well and it that a talent for this . He who are not widely known but have a knack for a natural style , and then them some of the most natural I  in a long time . It  s very refreshing and very obvious , making it stand apart from many other in and out of this genre . From the outset us in no uncertain that there  s no fun in this film , this is going to be hard , in your face horror . Oh , and expect the to be off tempo and unexpected . No matter how atune you think you are to , shouting out , or just sitting with a grimace on your face , he  hit you just about every time in this movie . It  s scary and very dark . One of the interesting about this movie is how dark it is , they used as many realistic light as they could through the movie . That the head of the pot , , , . Frankly I can  t imagine that they got away with realistic lighting throughout , but you certainly have that feel from beginning to end . The whole movie you the feeling of , darkness and the total loss of any . For the most part you that the team are going in and , but when trouble you loose all sense of direction and depth along with the . Once again the in the movie are superb , not over the top like other horror of the same ilk , but grounded in reality . Again at the creature of the movie and worked out what it would look like and how it would behave based more on science and our real world than folklore and fantasy . What he comes up with is a strangely creature which  t as all powerful as other would have , and is real enough to prey upon your own rather than you to distance yourself from it with the comfort of that very word , fantasy . The goes a long way to providing us with the and on an offbeat tempo . You  be something , and nothing , you  be nothing , and then the audience or . There are more than just in the movie though , there are plenty of , and quite a few  oh my god  , all extremely well , written , and directed onto the screen . As for the talent of the female cast , there  s not much to fault them . They are all so believable in their terror and confusion , but particular attention should be to as the lead , Sam , who you on a fantastic change of character , as does . There  s also the super sexy who some fantastic early on in the movie . - Jane No one also a superb and performance during a few where and were through the audience - that is a nasty man . What I really like about this movie is the reality of it all , there are some belief suspension , but we  re not talking parasitic that grow into forty foot winged , we  re talking something that  t that far from what could actually occur . Then there  s the themselves who speak and behave as you think you just might too , and it  s that part that really me into  s . He  s got a realistic script combined with who deliver realistic . With these in the movie you  re hooked , in , and there  s nothing to distract you from being thrown around with the movie . The ending is another strong part of the movie , it  s also very well , and you  be sitting watching the roll still thinking about the movie , you  even have away and still be thinking about it . You might feel slightly , but I believe that  s because we  re too used to everything handed to us on a plate in , and this is perhaps why  t taken either of  s as yet , because they don  t follow their standard movie template . Looking back on the movie , I  d like it to have had a little bit more - and please excuse the expression - meat on it . Tying something more in with the main character and her state of mind , as well as the opening of the film , and perhaps a tiny little bit more on the ending of the movie would have made it perfect for me . I think it does a superb job in the horror \\ scare , but there was room for a bit more psychological based subplot , perhaps more character interplay .",0
"The Phantom of the Opera is an old tale written by in 1910 . Webber made it truly famous with his musical version , and both to bring the musical to the big screen . The story of a child who beneath the Opera House and grown to become an and angry man whose genius in music and architecture . He the and the owner of the Opera House through a regime of fear , him to collect a tidy wage and have final say over all the . He a young chorus girl join the troupe and to nurture her musical talent from afar . Slowly he in love with her and to reveal himself to her , yet she is in love with another man and as the love so does the anger and hatred . The show is a world renowned musical and with it a mammoth fan base , so the movie of the musical surely a lot to live up to . Yet it took a huge hit instantly when was confirmed and the general opinion was that the movie was going to be seriously hurt . The casting of Butler was another huge unknown that took many by surprise , this actor did not carry such career weight as many and with no singing experience behind him there was a lot of concern over the film . However , watching the movie you can  t help but be taken in through some of the transition effects between the past and present , the comic , some of the excellent , and above all the superb performance by Butler . Without a doubt he is the biggest surprise of the movie . His voice can at times sound raw and harsh , yet this something real to the character of the Phantom , anger and embitterment seem to creep into his voice at key . There  s no doubt that Butler shown the that he can make an excellent Phantom , and he is the actor in the movie . Much like the old , in this film his stage presence is commanding , and his performance utterly believable . Minnie Driver , and Callow provide some excellent support , with Driver showing some excellent comic and character acting . Her take on the poor Opera singer is wonderful , and for many amusing . as is unfortunately not so good . Her role in the movie is weak and merely standing looking confused and for much of the film , weakly to her musical . Where Butler passion and feeling behind his role , to be humming along . is another weak portrayal , and as a conduit for a quick duet early on in the movie and nothing more , it  s hard to see why her role was even included . as also provided a very weak performance , totally by those around him . He more as a meek teenage Royal rather than a Viscount who could woo such a lady and fight for her .  s treatment was strong , but in somewhat . During the duet between and for example , both were in total darkness at times , and the lighting and camera very wrong . There were also quite a few of big with huge that just  t quite come across , the size and grandeur of the set or the moment in some way . This can be seen in the scene between and , to the similar scene between and in Moulin Rouge , it well short and  t carry the same impact . The story is strong though , and for a lot of entertainment . The musical are never out of place , apart from the duet , and they build very well to the conclusion of the movie . However there are a couple of that stick out for me . One is the fact that everyone just stayed at the Opera house and never considered leaving . For some this is very slightly at , as is so bad that no one else would employ her , and Madame was brought up there . Yet I never understood why people just left as did the original owner at the start of the tale . The second issue I had with the story is the speed at which happen . When for , or the Phantom turns on them all , these are quite big , especially in of choice , yet they are handled quite flippantly and the turn on a coin . There with both a need for the to fit the score and the pace of the movie rather than the story being written and then the musical fitted into the story . Still the musical were for the most part good , the story enjoyable and some of the effects , and making for a visually engaging movie .",0
"The film the  s basic and even included the , albeit briefly . There was , however , had an extremely important difference : it was told through the of a lover not a fighter and this so much . A lot of the underwent in order to support the of love , pride and desire , the three great that burn within the hearts of men . A great example would be , a cowardly pretty boy in the but a noble prince in the film for the obvious reason that it would not look good if a queen ran away with a . Speaking of , it was pleasing to note that the in the film were given bigger and , especially that of  s . However , while glory and honor were there , they were by the , which was really annoying . , the hero of the , was to a battle - happy ruffian . In fact all the were as . Thankfully they left alone . He was himself ; a wise and diplomatic leader who would often be the one to calmly come up with effective and with his gift of gab could keep peace . Taken as a whole , the film was quite delightful , a clear window into the culture of the . The actor  s their with vigor and enthusiasm , especially Rufus as , with his half - mad stare , forceful speech and disdainful stance and Fox as with her wide and strained with horror coupled with a royal  s demeanor . The lighting and the of the and the of the like the foreign song during the discovery of the wooden horse added to the mystery and allure of the strange artifact . The straightforward alignment of run smoothly and the prophecy of Troy  s downfall and the banishment of and the abduction of by was a nice touch ; it gave the background of the . The were authentic - looking but sadly the same cannot be said of the animation of the . There was a lot of symbolism in the film like the Troy as the the departure of happy times . The script however is debatable . On one hand it is full of witty but on the other said don  t seem to fit well with the time frame . My final rating of this is a 3 . 5 . It is a great film , perfect for a romantic person but for a fan of the classic tale like myself its best to see it just once and not delve in too deeply or suffer the of disappointment .",0

The trainer not had contact with his daughter in many and his continued pursuit of her is constantly . The movie just us a small piece of why the trainer  s does not have a relationship with his daughter , but this let  s the viewer ponder one of the many it . He his big chance on a girl ... who he would not train because of her sex for . I get the portrayal as this is the relationship with his daughter he never had . The girl  s family is lazy , greedy , self - centered people whose only concern with the girl fighter is how much money can she give them . So two in a pod are with each being quite stubborn . Somehow the relationship . The cautious trainer and fighter take a great ride to the title fight . The end is one of those life searching most of hope never to have to make . Yet a decision the trainer to make ... life or death . I strongly caution this film is not for 17 and under . It is loaded with profane language . I would have rated the film R instead of - 13 and if not for my devise I would not have let my 13 year old watch .",1
"Stealth was a pretty decent movie , but it of something ..... They also the innuendo . A lot of what they said was supposed to be funny but they were just crude . and obnoxious . The  t even go along with the movie , they should have those . But the Stealth fighter were sweet , and the special effect were off the chain . I the movie but it could have been way better . I recommend it for anyone who can handle a few offensive , and intensive , fast pace action . I rate this movie 7 / 10 because it was good ( i it but it could of been way better ) if you are reading this and are debating to go see it with a friend , only go if your a big fan of one of the .",1
"of Troy was in 2003 , a made - for - television movie based on the tragic , produced by and directed by Kent . I watched all the hundred and seventy - five of the film during the latter days of this year , and was left pondering on how the plot on the concept of the evil of excess . This concept is in the of the three : wealth , glory , and love . These were the three men most and though none of these are inherently wicked , in the end we see that these the men who sought them most . Wealth was one of  s ; it was for wealth that he Troy . by this desire , he even his daughter , . What did this lead to ? A brutal death \u0096 he was in vengeance . , on the other hand , was primarily driven by the call of glory . He lived for glory and nothing was to him than triumph . Yet , to what did this bring him ? To Death , as we all know , by an arrow in his heel . Then there was , who was only by love . Love was front and center , love was , and as long as was his , he was alive . Nevertheless , the ten when he had love was ten of war , with pain and suffering all around him . He also in the end . Thus were the of excess . I had many about the movie , especially on the in the of , , Hector , and . Yet , they must be , for when I look at how the plot was and , I find that they are necessary . Overall , the script , cinematography , lighting , effects , , , and the acting were acceptable for a production for television , albeit unmemorable . However , if the movie was unmemorable for me , it is a matter of my taste and \u0096 so I would give it six out of ten .",1
"On the 9th of , our class watching the 2003 film  of Troy . It took us 4 to finish the 175 minute - long film . Ted produced it with a mixture of action , adventure , drama and romance . And based it on Homer  s where it on the life of , by Sienna , and , . It all in Troy , with the birth of and the prophesy of ( Fox ) on the fall of Troy if he . But and when he grew up , he was with his family . In , after of being kept by her , was by her county but was by her own father , so stepped up to claim her . Unhappily married to , went with who took her from to Troy , which triggered the War that for 10 . The war ended with the Fall of Troy when a wooden horse the was brought inside the Troy . The relationship of & as is easily with that of Hector & in the film . Though & have known each other since they were young , it is seen that was degraded and down on by his older brother . Hector & on the other hand , meeting only in the latter part of their , their brotherly love to the extent of dying for each other . In the film , the were able to communicate their to the audience that the audience understand the of the better . Even the fight were made very realistic . The sound effects and setting also give the actual feel of the movie , taking the audience to the exact time and place of the story . The only scene that  t work for me was when the were shown sailing towards Troy . The animation of that scene  t done very well making it seem unrealistic . But aside from that , every aspect of the production was effective in the to the audience . I give it 4 out of 5 !",0
"This movie was but it could be better . If you  read the then you  see how much detail was completely . Like when Harry his Firebolt broomstick at the end . He was supposed to get that in the middle of the movie . They also about three that were somewhat important for the movie . Black was also supposed to infiltrate the castle TWICE . He was supposed to get inside the  dormitory and be standing over with a 12 inch  s knife . But this movie was also better than the last two because in my opinion , the new actor for Albus Dumbledore was better than the last .",1
"Normally , I  m with  s work . Unbreakable was good and was good . Sixth Sense was pretty good too . But The Village just turned out to be a piece of crap . I mean , come on ! How can you have a trailer that good and have something that so bad ? For an M . Night film , this was disappointing . On a note , the plot was creepy and when someone the , the sound effects and whatnot were very scary . And when you only see that little bit of the , they were also scary . However , when you see the full Monte of them , they look like something taken from Power . I half them to grow gigantic and shoot eye at the village . And while the plot was creepy , it was overall weak and in some pointless . All in all : not impressive . 4 10 .",1
"I read a couple , saw the rating and thought this might be a good film . I the original Night of the Living Dead and I  m a Huge zombie flick fan ( also have a lot of respect for Romero ). However , all i can say about this movie is that it was garbage . There is one line in the film that can sum up just how terrible this movie really is : They are about to shoot that have been the city and eating everyone when the Riley them with  Don  t . They  re only looking for a place to go . Same as us . It was all dramatic and quiet like we were supposed to feel touched that he was showing compassion for the . Wow , give me a break . Said had just the last real city on earth ! I could go on forever about wrong with this movie ... ( how can a zombie get and learn when they don  t have a brain ? they have nowhere to store such information . Why did the seem to get less stiff as the movie went on ? They  re still just as dead . Why did they leave the top hatch open in the end when they were so careful to close all other ? Why did you not hear a gunshot to kill that last zombie in the truck ? - , i guess that would have ruined you thinking it was still alive when it came out the door - .... all these would have been fine if all he was trying to make was a terrible B - flick where nothing to be or make sense , but that obviously  t his intent ).

"to watch this one , after being by and i  read but was not amused . I was really with it ( so much that I could not resist to fast - forward , almost never ). I agree that the plot ( and trailer ) an interesting movie to watch . But : no funny at all , flat , the we  re not interesting at all . I could really not care for the boy . I could really not care for his mum . How do you show the effect of drug abuse ? By showing ? see a good , gripping movie about drug abuse ? Try , and you  also laugh your pants off !",0
"If you are a man and were not offended by this movie you are probably gay . Everything wrong with  s towards father  s and men are in the two this movie . Let me explain . Husband of 30 goes missing . Wife he  s a cad .  t report him missing .  t call police .  t even call his office . an affair with the next door neighbor . his into believing her horribly wrong assumption . his reputation by telling everyone she what she people to believe he did to her . She is so self - centered she  t even know if her husband . She her because her trust run so deep she uncontrolled violence towards men . The man  t strike back , which was a joke . The romance with the neighbor is a joke . The woman is so vile , no self - respecting man would go near her . She absolutely nothing . She every male within hearing distant . She is a contradiction . She her to go to college but  t bother them . She is so self - centered , she  t possibly care about her . The worst moment in the film was when she lead her to announce they hate their father . And worse yet , the ( all ) readily this garbage . I guess father  s rank right up there with dog . The second worst moment in the film was after the funeral the witch and her brood are sitting at a picnic table with the witch  s , and they start laughing and smiling all gay and happy , confirming the father was indeed dog . Yes . Not a tear in site for dear old dad , who and was forgotten than they could get our of the funeral attire . The men are dog , the are self - centered , self - righteous , , and the are dumb as . So if that interesting to you , then watch the movie . It pretty much ruined my day and me wonder if my wife and actually care about me . was much better . At least all I have to do to avoid getting eaten is stay out of the water . How do I avoid gender discrimination and bias ?",1
"Aside from the poor science , writing , acting , plot , ., the single most baffling thing in this piece of trash was the burning of . If you  re in a metal box surrounded by fine burn  em . But there was furniture and and that would burn much better then . They would burn hotter , longer , and more efficiently then . So anyways watch this crap if you want to see some nasty fake . That  s about all this film to offer . On a side note though , seeing a fake nature slap him in the face with devastation was nice . And the fake Bush being so insecure and weak willed that he  t make a decision without his explicitly him on the  correct  course made me giggle .",0
"This is the true and inspiring tale of one man who tried to do something when his country into madness and genocide . Don is masterful as our hero and he was deserving of an and not just a nomination . Its is thanks to him and most of the rest of the cast that we have as good a movie as we do . The problem , for me , with Hotel is the casting of Nick as a UN peace keeper . Every time that on screen I  m out of the movie . No longer am I in but on a set and big name are trying to act . Its and it almost the movie since it several after each of his to calm down enough to once again get lost in the story . aside , this is a great movie and should be seen , not only because its a record of what , but also because its a damn good movie .",0
"Don  t waste ya money !!!!!!! Just got back from watching this at Square (\u00a3 11 . 00 ). I  only fallen asleep during 1 movie , well before today , now I  fallen asleep twice , one of the worst I  ever seen in the 25 I  been alive . I really was & felt like for my money back . The movie is really slow & only to have a few of excitement during the whole film , not much of a story either . If ya see a good exciting horror movie I  d advise ya to stay the hell away from this movie . Instead go to B & Q and buy some white paint & watch the paint dry . This is the sort of film that when it comes out on  t even deserve to be a coaster . Big down from me , also my mate thought it was a poor excuse for a movie as well . Don  t waste ya money !!!!!!!",1
"Very impressive on a visual scale . Very grandiose , as go . Not sure why to speak with a bit of an brogue , and the one eye thing is kind of disturbing , though there is another fellow with one eye in the movie , I guess to balance it out . like Count  s wife ! And the , why all the damn ?!!! Sir a bit obese these days . The on  s lover , what  s with that ?!! Troy certainly it in of plot , acting , and overall casting . The young man who young is a good young actor . The are stunning , the battle are epic . Mind you , this is just my personal rant ! Please don  t be offended . IT  S ONLY A MOVIE !!",1
"When i watched this movie i thought straight away after about 2minutes of it that it was very unprofessional and like a amateur , plus the acting is bad I  seen better in , but i  t expect much when there was only $ 130 , 000 in this movie . The movie itself is similar to the Blair witch project , except this film is worse there  s nothing exciting about this movie , its just like watching a home movie of a couple on vacation through most of the movie , i don  t think this movie is worth i also cannot believe it got in and . I recommend you before because in my opinion i think you will be disappointed .",0
"The Grudge is a very disappointing movie . I  m not going to beat around the bush , I  t care for a single thing this film had to offer . Well except for .... well I  m not going to spoil anything for you . The picture is so close in feel and look of  The Ring  that it  s almost laughable , and in the end it  t anything close to as original and terrifying as  The Ring  was . This is just kind of a hunk of fall crap , that it  s and from merely cheap . But the cheap  t what really me about  The Grudge , it  s the fact that they never explain what is going on and more importantly why . The so much time flashing weird circus crap in front of you , that he to add in an actual reason why all the supernatural are happening . There are enough unfinished and unexplained that take place in The Grudge to fill up a 500 page novel . The acting is nothing to shout from the with glee about either . in her performance like she  s a pizza , and the actor who the detective investigating the horror of the Grudge is in desperate need of a career change . Maybe he should try working at instead of acting . The only decent acting we come in counter with during the entire span of the film is from Bill , who  s in the film for only the first two . In conclusion , The Grudge for 96 , but if you ask me it like 96 days . I  never been so anxious in my life to get out of the theater and finish up my homework at home then I was when I went to see The Grudge . Don  t waste your time or money on The Grudge . Time is better spent fluff out of your navel , then going to see  s latest travesty .

The film way too hard to be deep and to portray loneliness . It never . It short in so many ways and up being dull and boring . Additionally , the were terribly miscast .

"is a political film . When a plane into a building it is not a random act of god , but there to be other at work , the reason the film is set in the 1980  s is that  s when bush came to power , and the end of the world was set in motion .  vote  not bush ( with hindsight ) The world been brain washed by ,  s dad was also falling into hypnotic in front of the , is the supper hero who been chosen by Frank to create a revolution and set right , by the Grame Green book the .

It  s the story about how technology more and more part of the warfare in world , for good and bad .

Also , it would have been neat to see that there were fighting with against this . The battle of against the with their was pretty good .

And though I thoroughly Land of the Dead , I can  t honestly tell y  all that it  s his best work . This is the first time that Romero worked with a big studio , Universal , instead of independently , and it . Though Land of the Dead all the Romero and gore , it is a movie . It is not his best work . I  t even consider it his second best work , but I still it , as it is the only Romero film to be in during my lifetime , and it may stay that way . He may never make a fifth  Dead  movie , because no one was really sure he was going to make a fourth one until last year . If the movie is still anywhere near you , I do recommend seeing it , but I personally cannot wait for a  Director  s Cut  . I hope one comes soon . Stay !",1
"Not a bad work . The special effects are thrilling , and the action intense , but the acting is crap . And the fact that two of the ( will not list what species ) are in the same scene was dumb . It  s not very Alien versus Predator , if two of the ( will not list what species ) die back - to - back . I did like the idea of a pyramid in , but to have it under the ice , and the movie to long to pick up . Sure there  s a snippet or two here and there of a Predator ship , but other wise , no extraterrestrial action until later on . The plot is mediocre and full of , and , as , the acting is poor , and when coupled with your aunt  s constant about what this person or that person should be doing , you  got yourself a platter of man - speak that will drive you insane . If you know of someone who won  t shut up during a movie about the and their , do not watch this movie with that person . On a positive note , as I have already said , the fight are really cool , and the and look much better than they used to . The movie also really nifty camera that make for cool . And of course , the last battle between Predator and Alien potentially the action shot ever ( but I  let you see for yourself ). So , in short , decent with good special effects but poor acting . 6 10 .",1
"s of Troy , in 2003 as a three - hour , is one of the many of modern man to relive the classic of Homer , which , in contrast to his tragedy The , remains indomitable and unshakable even by time itself . The movie does come close , however , to set its own mythological reference of the mystery behind the Fall of Troy as it the plot , and important making it a laudable interpretation . to its strength of a realistic account of the epic , the movie its feel the poignant connection with its tragic and equally timeless . The character of a subtle but effective of her nature and personality , more than stripping off of her , as awaken her capacity to make more mature and accept their corresponding , a process most can easily empathize with . The movie also in the three ascendant of men as it shape in  s mad obsession for greater wealth in conquering Troy ,  drive for glory in battle , and  and  desire ( and possibly love ) for . The production  s technical aspect added to the story  s overall appeal to the audience , an entertaining progression with its cleverly written script and well - thought out plot . But as most other of matching the genius of Homer  s writing with the magic of technology and the brilliance of cinematic , the movie still not sailed enough to bring to life the grandeur of Troy . It remains an incisive interpretation with its foundation rooted only on the dusty that remain the only a vague remembrance of the city  s lost magnificence and splendor .",1

"( watched in )  s ( writer of  Million Dollar Baby ) debut ,  Crash  is an attempt to be a thought - provoking film about racism .

( 1967 ) Quite a few condemn the plot for its total lack of common sense credulity \u2013 in a city of - million population , L . A ., the two dozen keep bumping into one another as if this were a small rural town . Personally , I do not mind the coincidence , serendipity and all that , looking from the angle of these being necessary theatrical to get the ensemble story . Really is the superficial treatment of the , as well as . to show two sides of every human being and there  s nothing wrong with that . But take an example in  s character , a racist cop who that are the cause of everything bad . So far so good .

"... I think that maybe I have seen too many in this vein and style , or I have been privy to too much in the realm of dark , violent , and intriguing noir , but there  s just something about Sin City that  t quite make it a masterpiece , at least for me . I  t dare tell you to not see the film , especially if you  re in its target area ( if you look at the , the primary 10  s are given by those under the age of 18 , or 18 - 29 , mostly ), and for ( his number of practically him as one ), he here a different style that out pretty well in today  s muck of . What can be , I think , is with Frank Miller , who is more of the brain , brawn  s , and of Sin City as writer / - director of the film , and originator of the comic this film is practically copied and pasted by . I have read a couple of the Sin City , and I have no doubt that Miller is a gifted artist . But as a storyteller , he  s hit or miss for me . Not that I am unaware of what goes into these noir - there  s the consummate anti - ( , big tough with a heart ), the strong , and the twisted , corrupt . Yet even in the best of Sin City there  s something , well , too expectable . Not to say the don  t do what they can or there  s not enough juice in it . But at times I felt , through Miller , was so faithful to the original text ( he it a  translation  as opposed to an adaptation ), some of the real interesting were left behind . There is something in / Miller that of talent and strength , but also total dependence on in the genre ( s ). There is no question that the content in the film is rather graphic and in the violence ( the ripping off of various body - , blood sometimes red or b & w or yellow ), and on the visceral level I it the brutality of the . Take Wood  s character , , whom he with perfect stone - cold , calm insanity . He is likely the most violent character in the film ( is violent , though mostly by defense ), even if we don  t see him these violent . him and ( , also one of the of the film ) are well shot , but somehow I felt a kind of by - the - quality as well . It  s strange to say it , and many will not feel the same way ( many have on the film  s brazen originality , which I do and don  t see ), there is something about the film that so much ( and maybe too hard ) to be easily . , in keeping with a very similar storytelling style of his friend , is confident , but because it  s a familiar style , it  t make the last segment - That Yellow Bastard - as exciting / unpredictable as it might have been as the last segment . The Big Fat Kill , which Clive and - Toro  s ( I preferred the later  s performance , in his one - tone voice  t as effective as - Toro ) should have been last and made for a more effective ending .

This is one of the best in the film , and something about  s direction - even within the of Miller  s writing - a little above ( some of )  s work . I  more on the subsequent repeat - which do reveal there  s more to take in than at first is apparent - that Sin City is , more often than not , a good success of style over substance - the film should  received an nomination for visual effects , and even cinematography , as it is of a highly professional quality . and Miller , in being so in love with the technology and look of the film at their disposal , at times miss what are in the , what they can do with the story . Aside from some , the in the film are less than great , trying to sound too much like how one would picture it .

"Is it REALLY worth it ? - A movie review and to the of Troy , a 175 minute long Action / Drama movie , directed by Kent and in 2003 , is yet another depiction of one of the classic Literature , The Homer  s told upon the point of view of ( ), the King of and  s husband .

But of course there other behind this war particularly  s thirst power and the desire to obtain everything . It was by in the movie  War is waged by , but it is human who pay the price . . It is indeed true as seen in the movie , that some point war is the result of the selfish of a nation  s ruler and his to obtain them . But in reality it is not the ruler who the of his . It  s those under rule who does . were because of  desire to get back and so did  s desire to gain more power through conquering the only nation independent from his rule . Their selfish led to the flooding of Troy  s streets with blood . Is it really worth it ? These ? I think not .

Doing so  t hurt anyone . It would actually help . The movie in general , would be a 4 for me . The did well on their from the . Although there were a depiction of some from the text and from the movie , such as and , the effect was still great . The cinematography was also excellent . It really the essence of the making the story line be more like the text itself .

"I seem to be in the minority here , but I thought this film was a complete disappointment when to  Dog . have given an overview of the plot , which I won  t repeat , and the film does have a few spectacular . However , I never felt that  engaged  with any of the , and as such found it difficult to care that much as the body count grew . Maybe this is partly a bloke thing - since the cast is virtually all , and character development does not seem to have high on the priority list , I found it difficult to get that concerned with the fate of any particular actor . The special effects are , but by now my mind was wondering about all the logical in the plot , and the premise of the situation the have to confront . There  s also the problem of the set - although I guess the intention was to recreate the claustrophobia of the of the , in practice I felt that after a while this just gave the film a one - dimensional appearance . Although there are frequent to other during the film , and I guess spotting them all would be vaguely amusing , in order to play that card this would need to be a better film . I was looking forward to seeing it , but it  s one of those in my opinion will soon be buried without trace , which is disappointing .",1

"I was so disgusted by this film , I felt to warn off . This film no story , plot or hint of purpose . The film after the standard  be scary  movie , which by now every film watcher become accustomed . So we can ignore the beginning completely . We are soon to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to all that you have just wasted your hard and would be better off watching static . ( Unless you have seen white noise - ) Acting is a DISGRACE and all of them should return to the pantomime from where they came . said that , even the best in the world would struggle to make this film remotely watch able . Their poor merely contribute to the disaster . Senseless violence and what I can only assume is the written word of yet another up  eccentric  writer , who probably himself to be an artist , in a film which will test your patience . It was not until my fellow watcher turned to me and said ,  We have been watching this for 45  did I that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag . Clearly something was missing and unfortunately it  t the audience . Rather than suggest what the film is missing , let me tell you what it : Dumb Blonde ( surprise surprise ), , bad - monster - guy - thing , about 2 of which is over , days , , ... and .

There was action , happy ending , comedy and it was really great ! The were a little less fantastic then you would see in Star or Harry Potter , but the story line was great . I can  t really say anything bad about the movie . It could have had a little more action and a little less easy , but in general it was great . It also a little boring at times , and the plot is a little obvious and sometimes some of the need a little more of a role , but otherwise I would definitely see this movie again !!!",1
"One of the most disappointing I  seen in recent , especially given the critical , its academy award for best picture , and the quality cast . On the plus side : it is a technically well - made film with good acting , as one would expect from the people involved . It also does a nice job ( mostly in the first half of the film ) of the boxing gym as a microcosm in which a diverse group of people at very different in their struggle with the of boxing for individual . It  s too bad this  t the main focus of the film . On the negative side : ( WARNING : ahead !) This is what is sometimes to as a  kill the kitten movie . It an innocent and almost too good to be true character that the audience will care about and root for ( the kitten ), and then something terrible happen to that character ( the kitten hit by a car ). The audience is of course deeply by the tragedy , which the illusion of powerful drama when it is really just cheap , generic manipulation . In this case , the Swank character is a beautiful , plucky , brave , generous , determined young woman from an background who not a single fault ( even her teeth are movie star perfect despite her family genetics , poor and boxing career ). So , the screen play something really bad and really unfair happen to her to evoke  kill the kitten  . Unfortunately , not only is the tragic turn in the movie manipulative , it  s also highly illogical . While the incident in a public sporting event significant enough to have a large audience and to be , and a felonious act by an at least marginally famous athlete , there is no media follow up to the event , and no holding the perpetrator legally or financially responsible for the . Then , the seriously injured victim is sent to 2 different medical in which she never any for the psychological trauma she  s going through , and is in a medically inappropriate bed ( I know whereof I speak ) that in terrible and unnecessary pressure that add to her . Finally , to evoke even more visceral , the movie to on what it apparently to be  acceptable  . The protagonist  s family are as disgusting and stereotypical of  white trash : ignorant , lazy , selfish , irresponsible , dishonest , parasitical people with West . Personally , I found this depiction offensive and reprehensible . There  s also the depiction of a completely ineffectual priest who us that religion is useless and irrelevant in times of tragedy and ethical . This to be an implicit justification for the  shocking  ending which I found too to be controversial . Apparently , mine is a minority opinion , but I  met a number of other people who share it . Here  s for better .",1

"I  t think it was possible to be more unimpressed with House Of Wax . I stand corrected ! First of all people don  t go and see a horror movie only to see people getting , cause you can see that in any other movie , but rather to get ( that  s right )!! I saw House Of Wax at 2 am and all I could think about was how much until it ended ... everything in this movie was predictable . There where no ! This movie  t create more than 5 of suspense ! This can at most be as a thriller ... If you want a horror movie try The Ring because even if you  seen it before it  s a lot better than seeing this for the first time ! The whole concept of a house being built 100 % out of wax is pretty dumb and not to mention that it  s not really that scary ... From the moment they say the house is really made of wax I am sure you can guess what  s going to happen to it ... Totally predictable !! Frankly , I  m that House Of Wax got such a high rating cause I  seen better get worse and i don  t know why this one got a 5 ! What a waste of time !",1
"The Village  is a perfect example of why it  s dangerous to - market a movie . While being handled like a thriller , the audience would have been much better informed about what it actually is if it were handled more as a human interest piece .  The Village  becomes much more interesting when watching it as a character study than a horror / suspense movie . focus on a movie can only take you so far , though . There  s still the matter of the plot - does it work ? The answer is yes and no . It works when you consider the movie a warning against being by fear - I once that M . Night ( henceforth ) had post 9 / 11 in mind when writing the film . In that light , one the purposely fear as a control mechanism and the movie becomes a fairly clever commentary on our times . It  t work when you question the plot to much . It  s not easy to try to make sense of the and of the . Superficial are all one can get . The final confrontation with a  creature  at the end  t quite work out as well as it should . For a movie that works best on a psychological level , the action involved . I tend to see it as a built in bathroom break and usually don  t watch it through . The actor  s of their are hit and miss . I don  t know if it was a purposeful choice of , but portrayal of the don  t ring as true as the younger generation . Given the final of the movie , maybe the were meant to sound rather with their speech . Regardless , the work of the older generation ( with a special mention of Hurt ) largely comes off as rather wooden and uncomfortable . The acting greatly with the younger . It is mostly the work of the perfectly cast and Phoenix that make the movie bearable at all , although smaller such as  s and  s definitely add to the film . In my experience , it  s general consensus that and  s together that are the best in the film . Overall , I think  s achievement in this movie is in atmosphere and a visually appealing style . I think it  s time he working on with other people - he needs someone to tell him when something  t work .",1

"Went into D . C . on to see Broken at the Landmark there . It was such an excellent movie . Bill his role of Don flawlessly . Stone was pretty damn good for the short time she was in the film . And they both actually off of each other pretty well . The movie was totally a movie though . I think a lot of people were worried that he was going   with this movie . But all are put to rest after seeing the movie , it is a film all the way . Everything about it ; the story , , humor , cinematography , , music , and are all . I love it . I am sure some people who see it , might find the a bit slow . As my put it ,  It  s paced like a film . But that is high praise coming from her . All of  s are paced a bit slow though . They  t about the big in life that most center around . They are usually about the small , that most of us don  t even bother thinking about . I think that his a bit more realism than most though . And that is part of these reason I love his . Below - This movie is also much more about the journey than it is about the destination . I love how the ending is left very open to interpretation . The one he met could be his son , but probably not . Or his son could still be out there somewhere , anywhere . He could be any that Don on the street . Or he may not have a son at all , the letter could be a Hoax , done by a couple different people . The evidence is put forth for a couple , but a definite answer is never given . We never know for sure . But it also  t matter , the movie  t about who or where his son is . It is about him looking back at his life , and seeing what was , what could have been , and what is .

"who expect an epic display of world conquest will be extremely disappointed in Stone  s , which exactly two fairly brief battle in its three hour running time . The film is not about conquest ; it is an attempt to create a character study of one of history  s most self - contradictory and enigmatic . The emphasis , however , should be on the word  attempt . in three basic ways : in its cast , in its refusal to meet certain character head - on , and in a directorial decision that easily among the most serious in recent memory . the Great was a charismatic , self - contradictory , and enigmatic leader who led and inspired the army the world had seen up to that point . He was a battle - tested killing machine by age sixteen , King of by twenty , conqueror of the known world by thirty \u0097 and above all one of the great military of his or any other age . Colin the character as a weak - minded , emotionally distraught entity , going through the entire film with a series of facial that would lead to believe he is desperate need of a dose of . It is completely impossible to accept him in the role . Although and give acceptable if not particularly memorable as King and Queen , the are equally impossible .  s for all the world like a hooker afflicted by an addiction ; it is impossible to perceive him as  s military whip . Bosch  s could be an ancient - world version of after a particularly thick night , albeit with better cleavage . As for Queen , history that she was an unattractive minor tribal princess that found annoying but whom he married in order to secure military aid from her father . The role , however , is considerably , and while Rosario it all she the part like something out of bondage skin flick . During the film  s theatrical release some that was as a homosexual . Unfortunately , you cannot offer a psychological portrait of without his general indifference to and him in bed with at least two men : the general and the eunuch and sex slave . That is who was ; that was what the ancient world was like . But instead of meeting this issue head - on , the film to  indicate  the through a series of longing , the occasional caress , and some of the most embarrassingly bad dialogue ever written for the screen . The resulting read like something off a television soap opera that been halfway into the first season . For the sexually insecure , there is a issue that some eight of this footage ; although I went with the unedited version , and although the in question are very badly done , I cannot imagine the deletion of these largely cringe - the film to any significant degree \u0097 largely because virtually everything about the film is no less awkward . The script is at best mediocre and the story line so incoherent that is to provide constant narration \u0097 something that the effect of telling us what rather than us to see it happen . But by far the failing of the script and story line is Stone  s decision to present a chunk of the story , such as it is , out of sequence . In essence , the first half hour of the film the tri - fold conflict between King , Queen , and the young and up to a major confrontation . At this point the film suddenly eight ahead to the invasion of , and the jump does not read as intentional but as an outrageous , unexpected , and disastrous flaw in the film . Approximately two later the film this  lost time  in the form of a \u0097 but by this point of the have been lost and we  all figured out the anyway . Stone is a master of parallel story and time . One need look no further than to see his skill . It is astonishing , utterly astonishing , that he could do no better than this and , not being able to do better , did not find a better way entirely . When all is said and done , is as an out - of - control weakling , his psychological are hilariously pat at best , and it is utterly impossible to imagine that this person could command such a large force , much less lead it to a single victory , much less conquer the known world . Clearly Stone was to reach a new height in epic cinema , but the had a word for ill - advised ambition on a god - like arrogance : . It was a sin they was never left unpunished , and in this instance the punishment is a career - crippling , if not entirely career - killing , film . As noted , there are several , a director  s cut that approximately fifteen , eight of them dealing with  s sexuality . include on the making of the film and on composer , who scored it , as well as an amazingly beside - the - point commentary by director Stone and historian Robin Lane Fox .

"I . Maybe it  s just me . Maybe it  s just the way my brain is built . Possibly there  s a fear neuron in there that just  t fire up when it  s supposed to , because I  t find this movie in the least bit thrilling . It was fun , don  t get me wrong . Plus the game of  spot the blatantly obvious social commentary  was delightful in its own way . However it just excitement . The  - -  factor it to have it settle in my mind afterwards and consider the of being a survivor in such a world and what one would have to do to maintain heartbeat . I always thought horror was about the fear of the unknown . The terror of what might happen next , just around the corner . What beyond the closed door . Real horror with your mind . imagination can create the most frightening of all , something no could ever visualize on screen . It leaves one wondering whether they would possess the to survive in the same situation ?. The climax can lift you or leave you thinking all is lost . This will sound heretical to many zombie movie , but I the recent remake of Dawn Of The Dead more than this film . I  m not the remake with the original because I  not seen the original , nor the other two . I  m it purely on the basis of which universe I found the more frightening to spend a 2 hour visit in . The of the the Green shopping mall were actually rather laughable . These don  t just walk , they shuffle , slowly . It to me like the just sat where they were until the were within 3 of them then chose to scream & attempt an escape . I mean really ? Where  s the challenge here ? They only from one end of the mall . I  t see any sort of battle plan flanking in order to obtain maximum kill . It  s been stated my many huge Romero that don  t run like they did in the Dawn remake , but which one was more frightening ? The who could sight you then chase you down with the intent single minded purpose of ripping your throat out with its teeth ? Or the you can ride your motorcycle in around while it it  s in the air grunting ? I  m sorry , but the that I might not outrun my pursuer and knowing what lay in store for me , that  s terrifying . In fact , those who about  the running  are strangely quiet in their criticism of  the thinking ? Wonder why ? Is Romero the only guy in the world to reimagine or evolve the zombie genre ? The Dawn remake far less gore than this film . But it far better use of darkness & . Of tight , it  s sense of claustrophobia . For the Dawn their whole world is now in the shopping mall . Outside , for all they know , there is nothing . They are the last of the they know , an island outpost in an ocean of the walking dead . That  s scary . That  s far more terrifying . No one to be the last left alive . This film gore galore , but it  s the sort that you slightly wince rather than want to throw the of your stomach onto the head of the person sitting in front of you . It  s  FUN  gore , if it can be in that sense I suppose . Gore itself not the terror . It just to separate the from their previous humanity for the audience more so . Without the desire to consume flesh all they are are just with no sense of hope or need . The most frightening people in this world of ours are the who look just like us . The most normal looking people in the world . In that sense Hoppers character was more frightening than any of the undead . In fact , in this film , it was hard to choose which were worse , the Living or the Dead ? One little question ? Does eating the living supply the Dead with the necessary , energy & calorie intake to continue on ? If not , then one might assume that eventually the dead , given that they are dead , would continue until presumably they would not be in a state to consume , let alone chase , anyone and would therefore be in a sense their own eradication plan . I  only ever seen this possibility assumed once in the film 28 Days Later ( a film I consider a almost complete plot / steal of The Day Of The . Think about it ). One would then assume that given this movie place a considerable amount of time after the original outbreak , that without a steady and almost continual supply of food the zombie population would be practically extinct 10 later , or considerably anyway . This film made no mention of the fact the had growing market or were even the to supplement their during the long between arm - . Like I stated , it was a fun film . But the last scene at the boat wharf in Dawn and watching the video camera to record was more depressing / fear than anything in this movie . What I will do now is watch the original Dawn on so I can more fairly compare the remake . That should really enlighten me as to whether Romero the genius he been so with .",1
"If you saw the for this movie and what you saw , don  t be too excited . The hilarious  Mad black woman  in about 20 % of the movie ( in which she is hilarious !). However , the movie is NOTHING like the preview . It is mostly a love story about a woman whose rich husband on her and her out of her house . I was so disappointed that I my night turned into a diary of a chubby 30 year - old . We rented this movie and  Cursed  on the same night . We would  gotten more enjoyment out of getting our from head to toe than from watching this 4 of garbage ! Do not rent either one of these !! If you do , don  t tell me that I  t warn you ! If you want a scary movie , watch  Dawn of the Dead .",1
"Thirteen  is like a coin , floating through space with both sides simultaneously visible . It  s the most dangerous film I have ever seen . It a very real and disturbing aspect of teenage life and it realistically and frighteningly while showing us that there are still , positive - all without flinching , not even once . This movie will scare the , but will educate the few willing to accept and understand what it is trying to say . Make no mistake ; this film an  R  rating for a reason . will undoubtedly forbid their from seeing  Thirteen , and I don  t blame them . Whilst I  m only 19 and just finished high school ( not to mention a guy ), I found this movie to be a very thought provoking , as well as reminiscent of my own middle school . I  seen a number of people come close to or destroy their because of involvement with and peer pressure and all that jazz . No doubt , this film will bring up of another movie about on the edge , which was , inconsequently titled   ( 1995 ). Middle school is indeed dark , dangerous , and seductive and so it  s no wonder that it is so alluring to , particularly young who are at a crossroads in their . In  Thirteen , directed by , ( Wood ) is on a daily basis by of the ideal middle school . She she out with in the smart classes , but it  s not enough . But we see are more complicated than that , as her home life  t much better : her brother Mason ( ) is  in  on the cool crowd ( which may provide the catalyst for her ) and her mother Mel ( Holly ) and live - in ( ) are both desperately holding onto AA for their dear while Mel  s also running a hair salon out of her kitchen . in on the  cool  stuff all the are into at school . She a purse to earn acceptance into the popular clique of as well as the friendship of ( Reed , who also - wrote the script with director ). soon smoking , drinking , stays out late , doing cocaine , out with older , and pierced . Before long , taken up residence with and Mel and then really start to get out of control . I have no idea why have to the extreme they have in recent , in that they are rapidly becoming rife with the crass materialism , futility , and utter bull **** that  s common in an adult world , which is clearly unfit for . And ,  Thirteen  us that it  s the young who are paying the most dearly . At first , Mel is warm to and  s friendship , eager to please them both and made a friend , but she it odd , however , that to never want to go home . Soon , Mel is aware there  s a lot more to , as she to have a strong , negative influence on  s behavior and the two are causing trouble at the house and elsewhere . Elsewhere being school , as  s begin to slip in all her classes and pretty soon she  s skipping them completely to out with . But their troublesome friendship more closely something in the dark corner of and , at least on a degree of latent bisexuality . Of course and  t , but it  t long before they  re lying in bed next to each other , cooing about how much they love one another . It  s really frightening stuff , at least to me , and the jerky , hand - camera are able to effectively capture the chaos of  s new world . This is a dark , brave film that  s definitely hard to stomach , especially since this is coming from a guy . This may be the only review written to mention  Thirteen ,  Menace Society  ( 1993 ) and  Better Luck Tomorrow  ( 2002 ) in the same sentence , but I make these because all three have something in common when their subject matter , which is often in the most brutal and honest fashion : this subject matter is on - edge youth . 9 / 10",0
"Don  t let the fool you . This movie is atrocious and it absolutely nothing to do with  s sexuality . His sexuality ( by many , I happen to believe he was homosexual ) is one of the very few about this movie which is well - written . The battle are few and far between . The we do get ( and ) are haphazardly put together at best . The rest of the film to rest on the bizarre concept that is only conquering the world to escape his mother . ( and why is she cast as ??), normally the bright spot in any film ,  t help the picture . She been given the direction to use some sort of anachronistic   accent that would do better in a Hammer movie than in this piece . as if he to leave the film as soon as possible and the only real genuine emotion I felt during the film was pity for him . The blonde wigged Colin is far worse . He to jump back and forth from a caricature to an absurdity with great ease and lightning speed . Even could not save this film . I give it a 3 because , after ancient history for most of my life , the computer of and are one of the few to be had in this film .",1
"is the most plodding , uneventful historical epic I have ever on . Directed by Stone , he the life of a major historical figure , the Great , into a mess of a film , teaching us nothing of the man , not to mention his great . It had been public knowledge that the Great had been a pet project of Stone  s for a long time , but after the it  s hard to believe that Stone gave much thought to who this person really was . The film from scene to scene , first on  s tempestuous with both his mother and father , moving on to his victory against a superior force at , his Eastward , eventually to , finally his return to the city of and his undoing . Yet , as much as the above description to suggest that Stone  s life , in the end I don  t really feel as if I know much of anything about or those around him .  s narrative is revealed via a voice - over by  s associate ( ) many after  s death , the tales of  s . He of  s early life with his mother , ( ), and his father , King ( ), who are at each other  s , although the film is never clear why . to manhood , in the guise of Colin , and to have a contentious relationship with his father , and to start one with his mother , until his father , and out on a quest to bring those that he are responsible to justice . This to the battle with the , and then on to conquer what is the known world , while at the same time , civilization to the world . It is said that when a long movie is good , you never notice . Well ,  t one of those . to go on forever , scene after scene , with little or nothing interesting to offer the audience . to want to tell us the life story of the man , but frankly , he stays undeveloped . Yes , the film lip service to  s desire to educate the world and bring civilization to those as , but these are just . scene after scene where argue with each other , which like drama , except that these  t really saying anything . The dialogue is just pouring out because they need to . The say nothing of value . There is a lot of attention to  s bisexuality , specifically his attraction to ( ), his companion , but there is no interest to be from this relationship , or any other . There is no sense of chemistry or love , and later when a wife in the form of ( Rosario ) she as just window - dressing ; again , there is no development of the relationship . In any historical epic , you usually expect some epic battle , any while there are some in , they are woefully inept . With no real interest in the , the battle just go through the , providing no excitement or energy to the film at all . The second half of the film mostly on  s trip east , but the supporting are all undeveloped , with little or no personality , who are all interchangeable . When the men rise up in mutiny , and some  s are and , but their mean nothing to us . There is some lip service payed to  s relationship to his father and mother , but it all up to nothing , really . There is no sense of why either at any time , as they are both rather unappealing , and all to do whine and complain about both at different times , making look like a , not a powerful ruler . The film also over major in his life , skipping major and lightly covering a major misstep when his through the desert in one scene . One the impression that Stone to cram so much into one film that he over many that should prove instrumental to  s life . When all is said and done , is a major failure , and an enormously disappointing film . There was a great deal of interesting material here , but it is all wasted on a bloated epic that to be pointless .",1
"This is the one movie out of about 20 that I have on that I  m really not what to say about . The idea of the movie ( once you  seen the end ) is so unrealistic but interesting . It obviously could never happen , and being that it  s not a star movie , it just  t quite work . I  m sure that someone else other than the blind girl would  out of the eventually and that it was not the 19th century ( other than the town council , or whatever they were ). One satisfying scene is seeing the one actor fall to his death in the . I do feel badly that he a mentally handicapped individual in the movie , I just don  t like him in real life ( he was in  The Jacket . What the heck is his name ?). Oh well , I  m sure I  think of it later . Anyway , this movie is alright , but a bit disappointing . Oh yeah , It  s !!",1
"Over There a shot at being a good show . Really . But at the time it  s and badly at that . It  s unfortunate . They have badly , and rather unbelievable . The we have in our Army are trained a lot more than what they portray them . The military adviser to the show probably  t know as much as he should . I also wish the show would stay away from the politics . A little to cause tension between the  t really bother me , but , the guy what at a roadblock me . In the military , you really don  t ask such . They don  t need to shove the fact that war sometimes innocent people , but they were given clear warning to stop , and other than Li 4 , we really haven  t had many of killing for fun . On the plus side , the show is tense , your really not sure what could happen at any moment . The story line may be linear , but the action is unpredictable . A main character could be from the show at any time , and that may cause some really good television . Hard to watch at times because of it  s potential to disturb you even . The same goes for the scene with the guy  s lady back home banging another guy within a week of his leaving . It  s sad but it . A buddy of mine left for and within a month , I saw his screwing around with some dude at the mall . A sad story , but it . Overall , this show could become more , and may , but it  s off to a so - so start and needs to pick it up a little before it lost .",1
"A Woman  s worth  The famous of Homer caught millions of heart with its story that many have of making their own .  of Troy  is one of the successful , being able to illustrate accurately the in the written text . The movie was produced by and Ted , which was on 2003 . The movie mixed adventure and action with romance and of course drama . of Troy  was based of course on Homer  s that about the infamous  war  that was by a cursed woman , cursed for being more beautiful than anyone . The long before intended conquering of Troy was on by the elopement of beautiful with , who was said to be the cursed prince of Troy . This instantly and of course his High King brother and their allies to carry on with their oath and wage a war with Troy . Troy was the city in the world and it was said that their gate was made of gold , meaning it was indestructible . For ten long the favor of the and of Mount between the two , making each one inconsistent of winning . However , the wise thought of building a gigantic horse that will hold the inside until they are within the of Troy . The  Horse  brought about the burning of Troy . Most of the / in the movie did justice to their although there are some who still need to work on their craft . I Rufus  s ( ) performance in the movie for the reason that I saw in his face even without his hatred and his determination to hold the world in his . I saw in his the pride and greed that within a man almost less than evil . His performance really caught my attention , and I him just as much as I him . And that made it more daring to watch the movie . I admired  s character in the movie rather than in the text . In the movie it that was more than just  a face that a thousand . She more character in the movie , more of a person rather than just some object of men  s . I the part when through the hall naked and before doing so , telling , her sister ,  They can look all they want , but they  never see me . It a lot about a person  s character . me that she was a strong and admirable woman , a fighter . The movie was fairly accurate with the text . However there are that the story plot of the movie from the text . This however , is inevitable knowing of course that the will always be in a different angle from Homer  s because everyone their own opinion and the ability to reason with it . I think the acting was of most of the / are worthy of an nomination . The script was good ; we were all in love and at the same time depressed by the end of the movie . The and the director did a great job making a 10 - year war possible in an almost 3 - hour movie . And I would have preferred a different cinematography and animation , more realistic perhaps . Nevertheless , I thought the movie was good ; pride and honor as well as a woman  s worth with  s character .",0
"You  d think this film was another if you  d attention to some of the when it came out . Troy is a modern - day epic loosely based on the poem of Homer written ago . We see what when young prince ( Bloom ) and away with another king  s wife and her back to the heavily city of record . All the of align and attack the city with everything they  got . The result is one hell of an entertaining film . I am not well versed in ancient history or mythology . Apparently this film greatly from Homer  s poem , but since I am only vaguely familiar with the story , that was not a problem for me . Much of the mythology surrounding the story was to make it look like a historically plausible picture . We are left with a story about who pray to , but are very much mortal . The film large cast made up of great ( O  , Cox , Bean ) and people who are just nice to look at ( , Bloom , ). The script some cheesy , but most of the give as much dignity as they can to them . Apparently this film was a very negative experience for O  who was reportedly so unhappy with director , that he to see the final product . That  s unfortunate , since O  the film  s best performance . Brad a brooding and vengeful . His acting  t quite right for this part , but any in the audience are sure to be by his physique . It took him nearly six to attain those , and the are impressive for any man his age . The battle are brutal and exciting . There are some in this film that can whip some butt . Eric and Brad have a fun , but too brief one on one match at one point . The large - scale archery effect is getting a little old . We  already seen it in , Gladiator , and the Lord of the , so the spectacle  t as awesome this time . Most of the effects are computer , but look good enough . The film is a little long , but it won  t cause you to daydream . The film had ridiculously high budget ($ 185 , 000 , 000 ), and it to make that money back in . and over the may yet make it a profitable venture . Heck , even about broken even after all these of being on the market for home ownership . If you  re looking for an exciting story with tremendous production , then Troy is right for you . I consider it to be a superior film to Gladiator , and that one snuck away with an . 9 of 10 . The Hound spoken .",1
"This one was of my favorite of 2004 , and I felt to write a review . First off , the acting is top notch by all the and normally I  m not a big fan . This was one of the only I have seen her in where I  t feel like I was watching play herself . Law , Portman and Clive all are superb as well . The direction by Mike is awesome . I see a lot of people seem to think that the message of this movie is  don  t fall in love , you  only get hurt  or calling the movie amoral . I think this movie actually a very moral message . The message is that if you mistake lust or passion for love , you are going to have a really bad relationship . And that is a message this society needs to hear . The problem of falling in lust and thinking you are in love is rampant in our society . This movie is a warning about what can happen when you make that mistake . As for the people that have said that it never like any of the care for each other , and deem that as bad acting . Well guess what , none of the character care for each other . No one in the movie anyone else . The only person in this movie that probably even comes close to loving someone is Portman  s character ; I think she may actually have other than lust for Law  s character . Everyone else in the movie is just after their current . However , I will say this . Definitely not a movie I would bring my mother to see . There is no sex in the movie , just a lot of talk about it . Very graphic talk about it . If you can  t handle graphic language , especially language graphic sexual , then this is NOT the movie for you .",1
"I love  s style - there are very few today who approach film - making in such a unique way ( maybe ). This movie was incredible . I like and he in his role as a retired computer businessman ? who is well - retired and he a son from a lover 20 . If you have a Short - Attention - Span than this movie and are not for you . The the character development and the silence - as - script approach that is pure . As he each of his in turn to surreptitiously detect his sons  mother ( and the writer of the letter that his quest ), he who are the same as he and at the same time very different . His journey more about all concerned than it and he does not know which way to turn , so he turns in all . I highly recommend this and hope it a distribution .",1
"There are many fine in  Requiem for a Dream , rapidly and done repetitiously in a way that a point explicitly within a few ( whereas most would take the more conventional , straight exposition route ); however , some of these whiz by to the point where they lack clarity . For instance , there is a scene early in the film where Harry ( with a accent ) and Tyrone Love ( in a non - comedic role ) are shown hanging around a closed carnival booth after dark -- we see pull something from behind ( and also what appear to be garbage ) and then rip open clear plastic of cocaine or heroin while car blare over the . Maybe I  m not astute enough to realize what is going on ( are they stealing and selling car to help finance Silver  s ( ) break into the garment business ? what ?), but that to my overall impression of  Requiem for a Dream : the of the plot are consistently choppy , but ultimately irrelevant . Like the drug - culture it at first to , then thunderously ,  Requiem  is more about the propulsive of addiction than a straightforward narrative -- in essence , any narrative that is an outgrowth of the  , and in the end , are wrapped up in a bleak , downbeat way ( really the only possible conclusion that can be ). - writer / director ( who cut his teeth on the stylish but showy black - and - white psychodrama  Pi ) every stylistic device imaginable to convey the effects of addiction ( of drug use are by of heroin works , rolling , and excited in the ); anyone who had even a passing infatuation with illegal will be at the accuracy with which this is --  s decision to speed up or slow down film , use a fisheye lens , , or even show of heat rising from a closed refrigerator , successfully the viewer in a manner as gripping as a drug .

"this restrained can only be made by an experienced , a guy who what he to say and how to say it and  t have to worry about everyone with witty banter or fancy camera .

The big fuss is that like ,  s an experienced craftsman , who that true talent in how much you give to your supporting , not in how much spotlight you take . Movie acting is all in the and subtle body language , not in bombast . but mostly it  s in being able to listen to your fellow . It  s , that a visual medium so much on quiet , but it  s what separates the great from the over - . Let  s hope that a subtle movie like this one massive media attention , as that would be missing its point . And what , many may ask , is the point of Broken . At the screening I many were confused , disappointed by the ending . Indeed , if there is one niggling detail that separates this film from perfection , it is the ending . Of course , intentionally weave into their , because they believe only God is perfect , my point being that the theme of this film is that in a quest for meaning , sometimes we learn there is no answer or that the answer is complex . In this case , to be saying that meaning is already present , but you might only glean it if you are prepared .  s character , Don ( with a  T ), only went on the road trip at his  s urging , and clearly felt the whole thing was nonsense .

Perry knew that the leading lady  s character was going to get on most black  s -- yet I am sure he the impact intended before moving her into the  get even  mode .

I love the number of close up in the middle of the action that let you know that Brad and did a lot of their . This movie was much better than I and I recommend it for all to see .

"Stealth is one of those Summer whose music is loud , its are even , and its of  I HAVE NO REAL STORY ! are the . But what else do you expect from Rob , the director who brought us The Fast and the Furious and ? If you dare answer ,  suspense and - esquire storytelling , then you truly deserve any in the face that you receive today . So we  established that it  s best not to expect much substance from a Rob film , but how does Stealth stack up against the other two I just ? This may alarm some of you , but it  s the of the three . I know that statement is probably enough to send most of you screaming for the , and so be it . If you don  t like outlandish action then you probably  t be considering this one in the first place . But what if you happen to be a fan ? Well , let  s explore the issue a little further . The movie does have a few going for it . , there  s ! That  s one very good thing . And then there are the special effects . We get lots of flying around really fast , blowing up , and it all really spiffy keen . So that  s two . Let  s see , what else ? . . Bikini . , that  s about it . Oh , and the might like Josh . If that like enough to warrant $ 8 + of your hard - money then knock yourself out . But what  s the moral of this story ? Beyond the eye candy , there just  t much here . Seriously , without . and the special effects , what is there ? A compelling , gripping story ? * snicker * Yeah , good one . Come on , it  s another computer - - weaponry - gone - wrong story , and as such it  t offer much new to the genre . There are a couple of surprising , but they  re not handled in such a way as to generate any real shock value . One of my main with the movie is that too much time is spent in the air . I  m sorry , but I can watch fly around and blow stuff up for only so long before I start to get . You  got in your movie - why make her wear a huge flight suit and helmet for so much of the running time ?? And would it have hurt to have a little character development ? The are so that it made me wonder why they even tried at all . I can  t quite place my finger on it , but there  s just something about the interaction of all the that too forced . None of them really . The dialogue is of such quality that you get the feeling that everybody is just trying a little too hard to reel off a pithy one - liner . is the worst culprit . At least he  t have to worry about making extra shelf space next to his this year . He back to his unfunny The Show days and the one - he on us are bigger than those dropping from his jet . He  s supposed to be suave , ya see , saying stuff like ,  I fly . You like to go fast ? . ha . ha . Give me a minute ... hold up ... side won  t stop hurting ... ah , I can breathe again . Hey man , you forgot ,  I fly , and I  just ask - is there an airport nearby or is that my heart taking off ? His character is more appropriate for an episode of Blind Date than an elite flight program . And I really don  t expect a lot of believable action from a film , but  t we be given something just a tad more conceivable than being shot at by a well - trained North army and barely being by a bullet ? Yet we  re supposed to believe she her gun up from behind some rubble , firing , and out a few ? . At this point I to lose focus on the  story  and centered all my energy on admiring .  s lovely figure . The movie also a few romantic , but they  re mostly restrained . What this is they give Josh some 2 - day beard growth and make him and reluctantly ogle each other . It  s a little cheesy at times , but at least it  t overdone . I know I  had more negative to say about the movie than positive , but it  s not * horrible *. It  s just not all that great . It  s one of those that to our most visceral . There are some who only ask for beautiful people , loud music , and impressive effects . If you can accept that along with the weak story , awkward of humor , and lack of character development then you may get the entertainment you  re seeking .",0

"Garden State is excellent . It  s funny in a mature kind of way . The scene with the dog in the doctor  s office is classic . It  s not distasteful , just very funny because it could happen to anybody . Sam up the screen from the very beginning with her silly giggle while the dog is trying to take care of business on  s leg . Clever , for instance Sam   she thought was retarded ... She  s great ! Genuinely a very well written story , script along with an excellent cast for today  s . Kudos , you have a lot of talent that I hope you far in the film industry . is just a normal guy but  t too sure about himself , as he  s pretty aware of his surroundings . Portman is a gem and she is as adorable as ever . Peter is always calm , cool & collected . Or just always stoned ? Garden State is definitely one of my . I hope to see more of on the big screen .",1
"I never watch cause it ruined Four And A Funeral for me way back ...;-) I actually close my and put my into my whenever there  s  Trailer - Alert  - except the I know I won  t go and see anyway ... So , after I was a bit out of Night ... though I Sixth Sense and Unbreakable . I would never even consider his  horror  or  frightening  in any way - but that goes for all of King for me as well .... it  s just about life , and how people react in - , VERY unusual , but metaphorical - .... So , I  t see The Village till I was at the rental and the guy behind the counter said  You have two , you can take one more for the price of two ... so I - ah , yes , I to see that , Phoenix is in it again , hope it  s not too much like or too moody and boring ... I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASANTLY !!! It me from the first shot , first ... Come ON , we are all grown here , I can  t be by in the ...;-))) I watched fantastic low - key and true to life , speaking like from an Dickens  novel ( though much at times ), every single one so intense , so real - it was just amazing ! What a fantastic ride that was ! What a sweet love story , that on ( one - way of course ...;-)) and - back , yet full - frontal in your face as the for the quest . is pure genius ! I love every actor in this movie , and I mean every single one ! This is a movie for people who like a good story ( any kind of story , but yes , this here a  love - one ..), true - to - life , a great but unobtrusive . Watched it again right after . Will buy the . Glad to see from the that I am not alone in my opinion ..!!",1
"I was rather about the of this movie . All I knew about it was what I have seen watching the trailer . Nevertheless we went to see it since the were rather weak . I was a bit disappointed in the beginning when everything to be about racism and I could not understand . I thought whats the big point ? So that dude is black and that chick is white .. Come on , get along . Don  t be such . But as the movie went on and I stopped wondering how it is possible that a bunch of people on meeting each other again and again in such a big city as and that the movie is something like an analogy and that it really  t matter if the are plausible , I to compare that film to  Beauty  in my mind . I guess it was necessary to show development in that in reality probably would take . After that I was very happy we went to see that movie . The message ( s ) of this film should be pretty obvious , so nothing to say about that . Personally I really  s acting and finally I saw Bullock in a role that I . But the rest of the very well also . Don . Altogether , a film very worth watching . I  m not from , but maybe it is even more worth watching if you are . Who .",0
"seen the trailer for this film , I  t have to see it at the cinema if it  t for some very positive here in the . It  t the most original film and the ending , while good ,  t gob - smacking . But it is very well shot and some strong acting in it . is particularly good as the inquisitive nurse . Her character generally  t need to be told twice and I the way her thought logical . I felt like she was doing what I  d have done in her . I  never been to the Southern , but the and felt very atmospheric . I  m sure to from those it a bit hackneyed , but to a viewer it felt mysterious and brooding . Overall , a very enjoyable was to spend an hour and a half . See it in the cinema , as I feel that the and atmosphere could be lost on a small screen in a living room .",1
"The Crow Wicked Prayer is a very different movie than the other three . Personally , since I that this movie was a , I thought it was be more closer to the first two and that Salvation would be a totally different Crow movie . I was wrong ; The Crow Salvation is probably even closer to the original two than The Crow Wicked Prayer . I watched it once , and I am going to finally buy it . Surprisingly enough , this movie had quite a bit of originality with the whole fact it more with the after life and with not just life and death , but Heaven And Hell . Highly unfortunate , and Tara were quite disappointing . I don  t really like that much , and I STRONGLY his performance in it . Furlong made an AWESOME Crow in my opinion , even though he did need to lose a little bit of weight as Jimmy , but the blackness made him look more built . was absolutely beautiful in this movie and her performance was pretty decent . As for the secondary ; eh , who about them . Not a whole lot to say about ; he a better native than he does a dude in all his other . The only real let are the acting and some of the cast . More of an Amateur cast than anything . I REALLY like this movie but I am not going to recommend this movie to people because its more of a movie you watch on your own risk .",0
"My son and I the movie but to see MORE of the and less of the other . The main ( , , , ) suffer from  a deplorable excess of personality . They were so stereotypical and overdone , as if the were afraid that they  t convey enough attitude to make the easy to identify . The egotistical  king of the , his fun - loving zebra , the  Big is beautiful  hippo and the hypochondriac giraffe . They were annoying rather than clever . Despite this , we the ... in particular . We could watch all day . WE WANT MORE AND MORE ! Leave the other in the background and give the the spotlight ! MORE ! It  s still a cute movie and perfect for to watch .",1
"I hope , they ( ) will never ever put a finger on Terry  s work . Or did they already ???? Oh , ! After this remark I can add a few : 1 . should not have been a romantic character at all 2 . The people ( ) should have been pointed to why the is sitting on a gazelle with a broken back or why does he a crab . 3 . Ford Prefect is  only  O . K 4 . I wish they could make with two separate so that we could see his facial expression of both at the same time . 5 . should have had more 6 . I wish D . N . A was still alive :( 7 . I am grateful that the movie was not any worse as I could not bear it . 8 . Thanks for reading this comment :)",0
"Downfall is a great film . It the last few days of , he turned into a crazy old beast ( not that he was the of beforehand ). He now no longer what to the and his regime is falling apart as he ridiculous military that are to fail . ,  s Minister of Propaganda , is by an scary looking man , he very angular .

"I call this the  Passion of the Anti -  because there are , although strained , in how this movie effect me . This movie is about a character from history that is than history . become a symbol of evil , and certainly I am not the first person to place as the ultimate anti - . But this is the surface of this movie . Underneath , this movie is about the German people . The ability of one man to take advantage of the post - trauma of a culture and manipulate it until the of compassion and inhumanity become blurred . Conformity and hypocrisy were not the only of the German people . I have always been unable to create a scenario in which I could see how anyone could justify  s world as a good thing . Even with the fear of the power of the party , the end of war should have given those with fear of the government should have been . But this portrayal a very real world . There were those in  s inner circle who were fanatical , but that was not true of everyone . What we do see is a culture who in its last days to grasp onto any hope -- hope to keep out the , hope to keep the national pride that brought them from the ashes of a great depression , and the hope that the continued blind faith they gave to the   would take them through . It was amazing that even in the last of  s life the power he . Even in his seemingly  normal  life those to him him . In his  work life , would bicker and plead with their leader on the last to end the insanity , but never once an order , even when it was to submit themselves to be shot . Just like  the Passion , there is a message there that is important to us as . It is a warning about the tragedy of man and our ability to give our free will up in exchange for group think . It is also a message that evil is only the face of the movement , and that the people behind the mask are just like you and me . The fact that anyone the potential to be evil . Even worse , that we can all delude ourselves that the horror within can easily be confused for passion , loyalty , and good . It is a hard movie to watch , because it is so well done that it is easy to look past the iconic mustache , and and look at a people much like ourselves and think  There but by the grace of God go I .",1
"seen the Burton version of  s biography , I for the  Director  s Cut  / release to see what the film did . On the plus side : and . was an alcoholic , and did dig ( Keeping real in the house of an alcoholic is not a good idea . It just . -- Will Cuppy ). ( Possible spoiler ) That  t seem to age could underscore her potential  supernatural  reputation , as in the film . On the minus side : historic detail . Not only did we learn little of  s military strategy ( rather than seeming to know exactly what he was doing , we just see him as impulsive and headstrong ). Further , prior to his battle with , was in by , but had up all night roaring defiance at the to unnerve them . But that also exhausted his own men , leaving them to go into battle sleep - .

"This film , which apparently is the conclusion to The ... of the dead  series , is so unbelievably bad that really don  t fit it . I the premier at the international Film festival , and had the   of sitting next to a woman who obviously never EVER seen a horror film before . She at the thing and kept her over her . which would be acceptable , if this was a horror film . But its not , its once again a massive crap failure of the studio system taking what could have been a great idea and making a crap film . start at , In the not too distant future ... , so have been around for a now , . You think that people would know that they were dangerous and therefore wear some kind of body , but nope . This is the fundamental thing that this movie stupid . The people wonder around in jeans and a shirt and complain when they get bitten !! come on ! Oh and the end is a real cracker display of ignorance ! The crew of the zombie mashing truck use to distract so they can take food and such from ... In the end they decide to go to Canada and proceed to fire off all the ... wait ,  t Canada directly connected to the ? so  t there not be in Canada ? NICE ONE don  t even have time to go to work on the script and the acting , though someone should be shot for it . So in conclusion : See this movie if A : You love blood B : You can not think for yourself c : your is a retard and real easy",1
"Overall I found this movie quite enjoyable . The script was fun , obviously at a younger age group , but was able to hold the attention of as well with some witty . The were quite well done , if there were some that were a little over the top as the movie . Some of the way certain were was very interesting and at times , I found , quite hilarious . ( by the reaction of a 5 year old beside me , I would say that I am not the only one ). Overall this movie is worth a look for some light , good quality family entertainment .",1
"The first time I saw this flick , I came out of the cinema with the same disappointment I felt after seeing Menace for the first time . But on the second , I I had gone in to it with my too high . Why , after the last two that I think are basically Universally accepted as ? Watch Sith with no , as millions did with Hope all those ago , and you  love it as I now do . Of course it its unforgivable , such as the now infamous  !, which like a spoof from the , and plot bigger than  s neck , but who ? I expect the   will be for the anyway . It its big dramatic that match any of those from the original trilogy , e . g fighting the Emperor , telling about the Sith , Mace being , Obi Wan ( if a little shorter than ), the purge , becoming ( except   of course ); and it its nice little such as R2 setting two battle on fire , nearly being shot and dropping his cane , The Emperor grinning sadistically as to come to with  s apparent death - just before going  ! It also does something unusual for a directed film , it time in emotional for you to feel those , rather than quickly cutting away . For example , where alone , torn between doing what he  s been told , or from in order to save . To put it simply , is it good ? Yes . Is it bad ? .",0
"There really  t a plot . It just the every day life of loser Dynamite . He  s by most people at school and goes around telling tall tales about hunting and his hot in . He the new guy , Pedro , who is pretty much a loser like him . They both talk in the this monotone , sleepy sounding voice . There  s a goofy outsider girl who with them . Pedro for class president and the highlight of the film is saving Pedro by a skit before the . The dance is a hit and totally unexpected because it  s actually good . The movie also  s brother , Kip , and Uncle . Each are themselves . Kip mainly stays on the computer and Uncle is a salesman who still of the big football game in high school . he he was good but I think we know he . He even money on a  time machine . The movie was sort of funny and it was amusing . a lot of stupid and it like he either or his a lot . He a down syndrome child . He  s just plain weird . FINAL VERDICT : It  t as good as I thought it would be . It was amusing and had a few . So , I  d only recommend it if you are looking for something unusual and not a slap stick comedy .",0
"Their low is one big fake . They got marriage because of love , but everything else is a fake . They are both special working for a different agency . They lay themselves as long as they do not meet in the same mission on the opposite . In my opinion the movie very good start but poor end . Actually I  t quite understand the end . The when they are still running away from the . we don  t know what at the end . what Producer to say is that all their love and life is based on running and fighting . The film itself pretty fast , with Bond  s style .",0
"Wonder why only with really heavy star cast are able to do well as far as this genre is concerned . Just the name of Ford would have been able to secure a rating of 8 + for this movie , which unfortunately is not the case . Its a nice and unpredictable movie needing viewer  s constant attention . The pace is good . Is refreshing not to see any stereotyped cast . The are evenly by the three main , which is also a welcome change . The action are not so , so one can enjoy them . The movie did not try to establish any chemistry between the male and female lead and justifiable looking at the pace of the flick . Overall , the movie .",1
"There is nothing I can say that  t been said a million times over , considering there are now over 90 of of  . However , since I lost three of life watching this , I feel to add my two . I am a lover of film , both bad and good . I had the bad of this film , but was curious to see this based on the  bisexual  controversy , not to mention it being helmed by . Stone .... how bad could it be ? I think a precedent been set in the bad movie pantheon . And not bad movie as in  , but bad movie as in  The Postman . My are the same as the I have read .... 1 . The casting agent should never be to cast another movie EVER . as Colin  s mother and with the adult ... who  s bright idea was it to cast two of the same age as parent and child ? The last time we saw this was in 1974  s  Earthquake , when tried to pass as Ava  s father . This was so much worse . The and on .  s face did not work . 2 . Colin  s horrendously bad bleached blonde mullet wig , was also a fan of bad 80  s hair metal ?? is too tame a word for his hair do , it should have also had top billing . His character would have more at home with a   or  Skid Row  sleeveless T - shirt on than the little leather he kept sporting . 3 .  s hilarious accent made me wonder how many it took for the crew to stop cracking up when they the .... everyone I watched it with and at every word she spoke . I blame this not on , but on Stone  s lack of common sense when her . 4 . The oft sex scene with and Rosario ... if is ever   in later life , this is certainly the scene that will be shown to humiliate him . Was he channeling a lion ? An alley cat in heat ? It to be seen to be . 5 . While I give . Stone a lot of credit for the bisexual aspect to the story , the were uninspired . had more make up on than most of the , and like he was ready to go to a Mode concert circa 1982 , hair and all . I would have preferred one roll in the hay scene with and rather than the of them staring at each other over and over and over . Also , why did the  gay  men all look like ? 6 . A movie about with no actual in the cast ? There were so many from all , I got confused and thought perhaps this was the . Why not hire a credible cast to AT LEAST fill in the supporting . A historical figure with an , how did . Stone ever sell this to the studio ? 7 . The battle , what there ? While it certainly the gore quotient , who when you can  t tell who is doing what to who ? And why not have some discussion as to the involved in winning the , is that too much to ask ? 8 . Was it really necessary to make the male child wear lipstick ? 9 . The music , a new low . It was all spectacle music , and did not follow the plot in the least . Very generic and sweeping and lots of , I can  t tell you how many times the group I watched this with rolled their and how bad the music was . 10 .  s war helmet , what was that all about ? It was gold and to have additional room to allow his mullet to breathe , it was out of a bad 50  s - fi movie . It  s a punch in the gut to realize many of these all made millions of to be in this movie . I gave it two for Colin  s nude scene , which unfortunately is the only good thing I got from the film . I would have preferred to see those five and just get the rest of my life back that I lost to this movie .",1
"It  s an  emotional manipulation for  type of film , with boring direction and cardboard . Nice by the though , some great , but nothing outside the  Hallmark King Prison  feel of the entire movie .

My recommendation : Skip this , and go see again .",0
"Creep is a rather gory horror movie which a movie like The Horror look like a - cartoon . like this usually end up in a straight - to - release because of that . But it some visual style , waste little ( it is at least short ) and some reasonable storytelling : The way the last train , how she the whole world behind the tube , the way is . The horror are made with remarkable little visualization or sound effects but rather with direct action . A knife is , somebody an operation and we see just ( some of ) that . It to say to the horror public that if you want to see some horrific , we will show you some as a punishment for your curiosity . ( Take a look at  s horror movie , much better than this , by the way ). The movie the setting inherent to the tube to set some atmosphere but when are present long - distant are used . ( It even fun of these when the night porter he can  t see a thing because of the long - distant shot of his camera , and then he ). Creep also many to other . The nail - scene to Se7en , The from , like an ugly and mean from The Lord of the , from / Run Run does a lot of running , . There are many plot in the story and it is also rather unbelievable that her friend Guy to rape her . And the story could do with some more . But wait : The dog comes out remarkable clean , and the two on the platform in the last scene are not shown . Could they have been the two male ending up dead in her dream ?",1
"Well , I love action , and I love , plain beautiful . The a little , u know whats happen way before it does in the team . A black guy , a beautiful girl and a white guy . U know who  s die , who will be close to death and live and who will be the hero . The only show the first half of the movie . Sort of I , Robot type of middle . The last 10 are actually sort of funny . The action and special effects are incredible . The in air are well made . A few factual but nothing huge . The acting was not bad , it was actually pretty good , could have been better but it was good . I just want to reiterate the fact that is beautiful . All in all , it  s a good movie , I would recommend it in because u wont get the feel on a couch !!",1
"From what I of Million Dollar Baby , I came into it with great . After seeing it , I can honestly say that I was pretty disappointed and thought the movie was just plain average . Don  t get me wrong , it  s a decent story and it does turn pretty quickly , but there are . The first problem is that it off way way too slow . We literally see come back and forth to the gym with no progression of the plot . The boxing are , but I more of them . MAJOR SPOILER The turn was probably the most shocking thing about the movie and kept me from falling asleep . Yes , it was a little touching , but too sentimental at the very least . Plus the death of was very grim and maybe a little unrealistic . See this film but don  t come into it with great .",0
", for , this movie is NOT scary worth my life . No , no scary , only a soft child  s voice . The story is basically the same as the Ring only there are ZERO . At least in the ring I in the beginning closet seen but thats about it . There  s nothing to connect to the real world about the movie to scare you . The movie is more suspense then anything , and there  t much suspense ! Half the movie they are on whether or not to get the apartment . Nothing scary , they are just looking at the apartment . The only thing that is decent about the movie is the end . Most of the don  t connect . And once again , I would like to say that this movie !! As in , there is nothing in it . For most of the time I was waiting for it to start . In the end I was thinking it just .",0
"I only saw the last bit of the movie . I thought it was . The story was one of those typical Channel super hero . There is a villain and some that get and a little boy comes to save them ( main character ) and blah blah blah . Special effects could have been since most of the movie is about flying ! Acting was nothing spectacular but the main ladies were sort of cute . I was still though . I the movie to be horrible beyond . But I was happily proved wrong ! It  s most definitely NOT an movie unless you are taking your . It  t boring , I  say that , but it  t anything for the . Don  t expect much , but don  t expect nothing either !!",0

All music in the movie are terribly funny ! The best song is  I miss you and Harbour !  Montage  is also very funny ! It  s great that the German version the in because otherwise it would make no sense I think ! And I will never forget the  scene ! I  watched it several times and every time i lay on the ground laughing ! The  and Ken  like sex scene is funny in different ! The look , the and the fact that in no movie with real this would have in the United ! :) What I din  t understand was the self sequence ! Does Parker and Stone like him or not !? I remember one of them talking in  Bowling for Columbine !? Maybe it  s sarcastic ... The oral sex scene between and is a little bit weird ! : X And it  s a bit to hard for my opinion to show Kim as a roach ... It  s one of the I  seen in my whole life !

"I just bought this film today to go along with the other two Crow I own . I was skeptical at first , but aside from the obvious over - use of the used in the other  To make right  ., and the of how those were put into the film , I would say overall the film ranked a good 8 out of 10 in my book . The Crow : City of , in my opinion was worse than Wicked Prayer in my opinion , but I still have a love for them all . I read one statement here about not the funds for . But if you will notice , in each film the visual transformation into The Crow and it  s of face - painting differ from one another . in the Lee classic , in , and whatever was used in . And the on each of the were different as well . In fact each movie is different from the other , with a common thread , but different story line . If anyone or this , be sure to look at the making of the film , and all the   before watching the film to get a good idea of what the director , crew , and were thinking while making this movie . Oddly , this series of rate far better with me than re - we are getting of classic television and of the past . The Crow series a universal message , and although it is a series film , is not a re - make of a film from yesteryear which I loathe . Look at it this way , if was just a remake of the Lee classic Crow film , no one would watch it . The to make different from the in the Crow series , and I believe , and feel , they accomplished their goal . Sure it a couple hokey , but I only deduct 2 in my rating scheme from making this one a classic . Not bad ... not bad at all .",1

"This is one of those rare that completely drew me in , implicitly forcing me to accept all the ground it laid out . It was such an EXPERIENCE that to break it down into separate ( plot , characterization , cinematography ) would be a travesty . However ! As this is a review and not , in principle , a mere recommendation , I  make some effort to explain about the movie . As this is a movie from -- and thereby subject to all of you  t find in a -- there are some that may be a bit shocking . For one thing , there  s the mature content : primarily , the shocker here is in exploring that would likely be taboo for any , and an absolute death sentence in of finding studio . Perhaps more importantly , this is a movie that -- if not -- an active viewer . High - budget , riding on the of , tend to provide rather explicit -- that is , they fill in any potential with some type of explanation . It may simply be a viewpoint on how a  good film  is , but this trend is not present in : logical are made , and it  s your job to keep up with them . I personally the change a lot : it  s refreshing for a film to require something from its once in a while . Again , as with many , this should be as a cohesive whole , and from that standpoint , I can say that it  s an absolutely essential choice for any strong - people considering it .",0

As bad as this movie is ( a 10 - year - old who for 12 on a rock - and - rolling prop plane , and an immigrant who is like a child ) there  s something to love about it .

This is the first time I can actually say I Like , I like him A lot . His acting in this movie , alongside , was superb . I remember when I saw this in the theater , I was fighting with my . I ran out of the theater and her . That is the impact this movie can have . I do , however , recommend watching this at least twice before making a judgment on it . The first time you can be very confused , and almost lost at certain . The reward is finally understanding the plot . Some wonderful music really the mood as well . Beck a very important role in this movie , when is breaking down as the rain down . Do yourself a favor and give this movie a chance , or for some a second chance .",0

The end of the movie made me cheer as I realize that Napoleon does have his days where he Pedro defeat the candidate for student body president , not to mention that his cousin the girl he and his mean Uncle the crap out of him . I revealed the ending , but does Napoleon ever get a girl ? You have to find out for yourself .",1

The audience can see right through them yet get by the computer . Open Water is an example of a brilliant film with only the essential animation , on old fashioned film . The acting is believable and the cinematography is transcendent of most other recent . There is not a great reliance on computer animation in this film , despite this they are very realistic .

"We had been watching of Troy during our for the last two . This approximately 3 - hour movie is an action / adventure film based on the by Homer and it was in the year 2003 . It was produced by Ted , together with Kern , the - producer and the executive producer . The story is about the ten - year war between the and the during the ancient times . It basically around the of the different like who , Hector , his brother , , the king who for power and ,  s brother who told the story from his viewpoint and who also dearly . For me , the presentation of The in this film was remarkable because most of the plot was true to the text . But even though they  character into an important factor in the story , I think it worked for the film because this made like me feel the burden and must be when they the of a whole city just for their love . On the other hand , I  t like the way they because they reduced his character into a mere blood - thirsty creature who was with war , when in fact , he was a major character in the original epic and there was more to him than just killing people . Among the , the one part that was very remarkable for me was when the film us that was not pure evil . I saw his side through his daughter , , whom he dearly , just like how would love their only . But when he the one person he sincerely to offer her as sacrifice , I felt that nothing could ever stop him from reaching his goal since he had to pay a very high and precious price for his . Through this , I understood why he was unstoppable in conquering Troy . As an over all rating , I give the movie a 4 out of 5 . Although some  t properly , the cinematography , sound effects , and the lighting were spectacular . The script was all right and it was well by the . I think that the movie was effective because as I was the film , I felt the and that each character underwent .

"Truly shocking sequel , and not in the way it should be . is ( Hardly likely to forget that character name in a hurry ; doubt I  ever any movie character to by name as many times as is evident in The Ring Two ), mother to ( Though it more like to me ) , that creepy little boy from the first film which ended with him watching * that * video , if I recall accurately . Well the two of them have home and  s landed an easy job with a local newspaper as opposed to the big heavy city rag she was formerly with . They have abandoned their old as a result of the evil Samara and hope they have her and can move on . However , when a local homicide particularly of a who with some kind of  face , on the scene to find that it Samara  s back and up to her old again . The rest of the movie all 3 of them in a kind of head to head with Samara possessing and threatening to stay around for good . , that would be a fair synopsis . Now for the the review : .....* *..... This is bad . Really , really , really bad . Now I  tell you why . What  The Ring  got right was that it was pretty faithful to the original movie which was such a smash hit in the first place . By not messing too much with the previous formula and   the story to the usual popcorn extent , the remake was reasonably effective as a psychological chiller . The problem with the sequel is it * nothing * to do with the original franchise ; it  s an all new side - branch story . While in itself there  s nothing wrong with this as it , it becomes an issue when it with , for example , ridiculously background music , and comedic , some intentional , some not so . The Ring Two taken a great premise and turned it into an average Yank horror . There  s nothing new here , apart from one singularly smart scene which works well ( And it  s not scary , merely impressive ), and the great strength of the whole Ring  empire  is the sheer originality of it . Ring was simply stunningly seminal horror , Ring 2 a lot of the original magic with some shiny , Ring 0 was a great tale , and the remake to translate a lot of the from all 3 into a pretty decent and workable film for the western market . This crude effort any of the punch of * any * of the other 4 . There are no good , boringly slow direction , overly dark cinematography , and pointless from Sissy , Cole and . The Ring Two was a real disappointment , albeit a predictable one . Uninspired from the off , it  t even look like the could be with it , lamely their like they were on half pay that day . Avoid .",1
". & . Smith . When I sat ready to watch this , my first thought was to continue with an open mind . As it is , when watching an action adventure film , you must slide into that state of mind . Taking a film like this seriously would only result in a travesty . In my opinion if the , and intended to make a family feature which you could sit through with a smile they . First of all i did enjoy the cast . Each character was believable as who they were meant to be . I know that strange and as ; but it worked for entertainment . Their was chemistry between them , and it they being on screen together . And that always between two leading . Some may have it a little far . For example when they are fighting , it a little out of control but still the fun element with going too far . The action are nice and balanced , and in the end it becomes what it was meant to be ; An action film , which excitement , , and a rich plot to keep an audience for a little under two . All in all , a fun film that kept me . 78 / 100",0

"One feature which the original trilogy of Star was it  s economy . They were all made on relatively low - and , in episode four  s case , a short space of time .

"of Troy is an epic adventure story produced by Ted and directed by Kent . This three - hour film was last 2003 and as we all know , Homer  s  The  inspired this film . The after the at Troy and about how the were by the at war and how the met their bitter downfall . of Troy on the other hand further or how the war , the cause behind it and the life of the even before the war . The film basically is about who this god - like beauty that a man it hard to resist . She  s deeply in love with and away with him although as her husband . This to go to war and being his self - centered brother this to attain his own goal , which is to capture the city of Troy . For , men are fighting for the love of the most beautiful woman . It comes to an end with , and the rest getting due to their egoistic attitude , impulsiveness and immaturity . Leaving and alive , no choice but to follow him back . Unlike the plot of Homer  s  The , of Troy the normal one that with an introduction and with a resolution . It  t start after the Troy but it with the  reason  why the were in Troy . They why ended up with , then , . The theme would probably one  s pride and desire to attain or achieve something . All of the desire in one point or another , like when desired and decided to take her . Another example is  s desire for the city of Troy that he even used his brother for this desire , and another is  desire for glory and bloodshed . As you have one  s desire him his doom or downfall . It all comes down to pride when it comes to downfall , for example , was so that he can bring the horse inside , and so because of his pride were able to enter Troy .  s so blinded by his pride and evil that he only of what  s good for himself , the only thing that him less evil is he still the feeling of regret .

I believe that he was not given justice for all he did in the film was shout .   immortality  was not on the film ; he just to be a typical power - hungry warrior who  s searching for fight . In the film , had to shout about , like how bloodthirsty he is , and . It only that  was not given justice for one had to reveal his character verbally . The who in the film were great and really convincing . I believe that they really the  true to the . They were able to connect their corresponding to themselves that them to reveal such convincing and to us . So convincing that it came to a point where some  hate  the character . Sound effects , , and other effects were effective because it  t overpower any scene but instead it it or the mood at a given scene . The slow motion every time the and  work  and the smoke effect was really convincing , combined with the  sleepy music , these really bring the otherworldly effect to the scene . I also want to praise the director , producer , and all the staff for coming up with such great movie . Although it  s an epic , he and the staff made it really interesting for the of our time . They were able to present the story and well and were able to maximize the potential of the , effects and story itself . In a scale of 1 to 5 , 5 being the highest , my rating would be 4 . I believe that they gave justice the although some of the like really  t work for me . They were able to show what really clearly and were able to let the understand this epic easily . The story itself is somehow inaccurate because it  t show the part where they threw off the wall and the killing of to soon . But overall the story is great , something you can watch over and over again , a story that will kind of link us to the past for we can see how people each other , customs , . . 15 Ana T .

"I doubt if on the day in 1994 when Nirvana front man , , ended his life with a shotgun to the head , anyone saw his soul rise toward heaven , as Van Sant in  Last Days , his recent foray into the interpretation of cultural phenomena that he also featured in Elephant . As I watched the last days of out  rock and roll  Blake ( ), patterned after , I felt Van Sant once again the ennui and misdirection of unusual people to be famous as he did for the high school in Elephant . Determinism : From the opening sequence where he is by a waterfall to the final heaven - bound image , I never thought Blake could do anything to liberate his spirit other than commit suicide , a state of being in rock and roll all too common , especially for those addicted to heroin . At any rate , Van Sant is not interested in providing rationale or template , just in showing of psychic turmoil that are inscrutable , such as did for in Apocalypse Now or for in . It is not always fun to sit through the numerous long of Blake doing almost nothing but common such as making macaroni and cheese . Yet if Van Sant us to know why life is not worth living for this lost soul , then he by showing how isolated and mundane Blake  s life actually was at the end . If Van Sant to show that great genius great , he by showing the artist  s flawed human nature trying to deal with fame . The big old house where the band is is an apt metaphor for the ragged , , useless band that can  t even talk straight . In fact , there is little , which is usually or so terse as to be negligible .

Secondly , the release of the film been regularly and is now available on region 3 before it even made it onto cinema . These are usually that the quality of the film is less than certain . Thankfully , I need not have worried . I have no problem in saying that this is easily Jet  s language film . It is also possibly his best modern day role , the of Hong ;  My Father is a Hero  and  High Risk . I still feel that Jet  s have been in period such as  Once Upon a Time in China  and  Sai  and this is likely to remain the case . However , here it that he can not only still produce a fine , grounded , physical performance , but he can actually hold his own on a purely dramatic level . As a story , the Dog is more interesting than first . I fully the plot line of being a trained bodyguard , literally kept like a dog on a leash since childhood to be a transparent excuse to put fight into a film . This is obviously partly true , but , whilst exploring the for  s pseudo - imprisonment and his obvious trouble re - socially , we get to see the emotional of Jet  s personality shine in a way so annoyingly restricted in his more recent . Jet is an awesome physical performer , but there is so much more to his overall screen charisma that make him an international star . It is probably true to say that most people who intend to see Li  s are as interested in the action as they are in the . In this area , I have to admit to being slightly disappointed . My were clearly sky - high after hearing that Woo - ping would be working with Jet again after almost a decade . Woo - ping is responsible for Li  s hour with  Fist of Legend  so perhaps my were a little unrealistic , however , the here are not up to the same standard . I have often felt that although Hong can do great work on Western , without the time their Eastern , and the quality of the stunt they often pale in comparison . The same is true here , as although the choreography is neat , and the very able , nothing to the fearlessness , sublime fluidity and speed with which the Hong from the last 20 are capable . Nevertheless , the action on show is brutal , bloody and often balletic . Jet  s next feature is likely to be a production with Jet the legendary Gap . Hopefully , he will return to Hong permanently , as with the Dog I believe he as high a note as he is likely to with the upon him by Western . At least now he can return in the knowledge that he easily been the most successful Hong export with a much higher quality level of output than even the of or Chow Fat . I heartily recommend the Dog ( or Unleashed depending on your location ) to almost everyone \u0096 even those who are not of martial art or Jet Li in particular , as this is a production that could stand on its own as a purely dramatic exercise . It is not without its , as some may feel it is a touch melodramatic or even a little too short , however , it is still a touching film which to show everything Jet to offer from his likable , shy persona to his impressive physical grace .",1
"The Life Aquatic with the tale of a - like figure whose best days are behind him , doing one more perhaps pointless voyage before calling it a day . For me any film with Bill is usually going to be good because if for no reason other than that he can make an average film work . , , , Jeff and are also thrown into the mix and by most this film a pretty good cast . I see this film as being the sort of film that works on many subliminal , there  s a lot to chew on and it  s the sort of film that leaves an impression ( on me at least ). The Life Aquatic with a fairly unique story , a lot , in an unpredictable fashion and goes out on a high note probably more through luck than anything else . I quite the film although the only thing I  t get while watching was why deliberately fake - looking were used , but it went with the air of the film in general . I  m to see a lot of people have adversely to the film but I expect that  s a result of people that they  be seeing a regular comedy and have those unfulfilled . This film works on more of a personal level , on the level of between people and what point they  re at in life . This is the best new release I  seen in a while so don  t expect a film for and enjoy the film .",0
"When a series to present itself as hard - bitten and realistic , it needs to pass a certain test . I  Blue  and the original  Law & Order  for their gritty realism .

"Rob Zombie made it known that he was the grisly horror of the with this unsettling rehash of bloody murder . You have to be familiar with that period to understand the style he  s here . Mostly , Zombie to rebel against conventionality and innovation in this film . Standard storytelling to go out the window at regular and an mood over . It  t always work and comes across as slapdash , uncertain . I  m beginning to think the really were the best period for certain , mostly horror , - fi and . I used to think I felt this way because that  s when I first to see in earnest , but now I  m not so sure . Many , Zombie , have the same opinion , regardless . This obviously , more than anything , the original Massacre film from 1974 , the plot ( group of traveling young people stumble across the most depraved family in the state ). , very active in of the early , usually in the role of a villain , to good form here as . , who a local horror show and in clown make - up . The strange & perverse family here , which Black ( also in her prime during the ), indulge in pointless sadism with their - at least the family in ( 74 ) had a rationale , cannibalism . The film to follow  s pattern through to the end , as a final female victim hellish , unbelievable concerning the revelation of  . Satan , a local legend which turns out to be true ( I think - unless she  s ). You don  t really follow a plot by this point , but just absorb the nightmarish Zombie at you , to be digested later . I would  rated this higher if it  t so blatantly copied the classic ( 74 ).",0

"I went into this film with the prediction that this would prove Jet Li to have some true acting skill .

Not quite as many as he usually might , his portrayal of was truly touching . The other -- Freeman , , -- are the real dramatic talent , yet Li his own quite well . Li  s unique brand of martial combat in film never been better in his . First , this is simply the most vicious that he ever been .

Yes , this movie a surprise ending but you  be able to guess it a long time before it , this movie is that pathetically predictable . For an R - rated horror movie , Hide and Seek is not very violent or shocking , honestly this movie should have been rated - 13 . It  s also horrible to see such great ( , Fanning , .) being wasted in this movie . One more comment , the male in this movie are creepy , most of them all make about little ( Fanning ) saying ,  She  s such a beautiful little girl  , all the while a perverse grin on their . I was half - one of those to offer her candy . This is a below average horror movie ; don  t watch it , you  d just be wasting your time .",1

The camera never moving too . Nearly every shot in this flick the camera is , tilting , or on a crane , or on a steady cam . The only time the camera around all over the place is when our hero faints - which he does with monotonous regularity . For all the effort that went into this film ( and technically it is very impressive ) I doubt if I will remember a single frame of it in a time . There  t a single arresting image , line , or bit of business in the whole 7 . A mechanical , soulless bit of movie making which no imaginative input from the viewer .",1

The redemption of the film is that it is saved by a few great an Newton and the guy and the Guy ( if you  seen the film you  know who i mean ), these alone drag this film up above ordinary and make it worth seeing . The one thing that does slightly annoy me with this is that it so obviously a lot to magnolia whi9ch is a much better ensemble piece than this is and yet a lot less recognition , if you enjoy this then you  be blown away by the sheer power of magnolia , which by the way Cruise deserved some kind of award for ! To , while this is undoubtedly a good film , it is inferior to other ensemble ( Magnolia , Nights and Pulp Fiction to name a few ) this is still a worthy watch , but seen Magnolia can only leave a sour taste in your mouth for the under appreciation that film received to this . 7 / 10",0

"First of all , if this is an accurate depiction of life in LA , the movie compellingly me glad I don  t live there ! Fantastic , acting , writing , film , and storytelling ! Don is really becoming an acting juggernaut ! One of Bullock  s better of acting too . The tension in quite a few is nearly unbearable . A few from the over all experience for me , however . The opening premise does not seem to ring true . Although LA is different from some other big , in that direct contact between people is much more limited , the net effect in of hostility and crime is not all that different than New York or . The problem is more with big in general than with LA air and in particular . The other problem was with the  s irrational treatment of the locksmith . He to speak well enough in all the other to be able to understand what the locksmith is telling him , but he as if he  t know the difference between a broken lock and a broken door .

None of this was made very clear , although this  s crucial scene itself was an absolute corker , no doubt ! A must see for 2005 !",0
"I don  t personally know the of this movie , but they  t be my , not , not from tonight on , since I  seen this horrifically bad horror . No , because I just feel they to tease the spectator , take the out of them . Simply not fair . Yes , of course he who goes see an horror film to be ; sure as hell he . But politely . Intelligently . You simply cannot ground all the horror in with sudden and , sudden , sudden whatever . I can as well come to you and shout in your ear and probably scare you , if you  t thinking of me . And this film  t just ( try to ) scare in a stupid way ; it  s also stupid , too . In the plot , in the , in the to introduce the . I can understand that some just need a very basic plot to introduce amazing and entertaining ... but besides some little pale scary , there really was nothing amazingly beautiful to see or follow . It  s beautiful , one of the cave divers as soon as she the bottom . Perhaps the scene was really beautiful ( an hidden cave with a rich vegetation ), but not even once the director chose to show us some of that beauty . of any beauty , this movie , very bad , is just and plain an ugly movie , which surely you , but not more than a long series of loud and you could hear in your room .",1
"I saw the for this and thought it would be so lame , but I was desperate to take my five year - old to a movie so there we went . It was great . It heavily from other like  The  and the Harry Potter , but at the same time did not do the total  formula  with the that I based on the . If you don  t go to the to see this one , it is a definite for rental ( should be out by knowing ). For all you who think Kelly is a , there is a quick scene in the first few that will make it worth the price of a ticket . really would have from better and lighting but luckily he  t get much screen time .",1

There to be no real differentiation between the  good  and the  bad  as everyone in the movie is somewhat psychotic and completely lost in their particular illusion . Very interesting handling of how life probably to the spiritually enlightened . I probably won  t write as even at this length , I am not able to submit as I don  t have the minimum number of .

"Within the hierarchy of bad is your standard mundane crap , then below that is your steaming crap which is only by the category of vile steaming crap . The only thing that saved  Broken  from exceeding vile steaming crap was about 5 of totally gratuitous nudity . It was one of those where I seriously considered with the people in line to buy so I could talk someone out of seeing this . This is officially the film that Bill into the Woody genre of welcome . Had the film been as bad as  Lost In Translation  it would have at least been an interesting failure , but here it the level of vile of  The Razor  s Edge  and in surpassing it . is an extremely boring director . If the film , which felt like it was two , but was only a little over an hour and a half , was down to remove all of the car driving , the staring into the camera , the plane and airport , it  s actual narrative content would not have to much more than 15 . Bill , I think it  s time you took up golf full time . . .",0
"The first time I saw this movie I thought I had wasted 2 . of my life . Then I saw it again and I was cracking up . It is a stupid movie and it should be celebrated for it  s lack of intelligence . It  s in the category ... a movie about nothing . It does have an awesome and a great dance scene . Watch it the third time and you  be hooked . Th are hilarious . I especially Kip and his funny lisp . His the hip chick ( who  t be opposite to him ) La - - , is also a hit . I really think there should be a sequel though to explain himself . Where did he come from ? Where are his ? Just give some background to the story . A movie about as a would be hilarious .",1

You may find it partly disturbing , finding it hard to believe , but unfortunately most of it is based on true behavior . Although some of the movie was exaggerated , it still stays on the of real . I just saw this movie once and fell in love with the ; Reed and Even Wood . Holly also did a very good job the role of  s mother . You might get the feeling that Mel ( Holly )  t being a good mother to and her off the hook to easily . But at a certain point , you want your  s to trust you , and you will go to drastic to do so . Be sure to watch this movie . It really what today teens are like .",1

"The movie Troy some entertaining and Eric does a nice job of Hector , but don  t mistake this for anything close or faithful to the original story . As noted in the trivia / section for this movie , a number of die in the movie that survive in the poem ( at least until later times ), much of the equipment and battle are wrong , and the core of the character is totally wrong . In the is vain , powerful , , and given to of anger and intense jealousy and hurt . The movie to show this by him fly into a rage when his war prize is taken by . is supposedly upset by this because he some kind of deep feeling for her . In the poem , it is quite clear that he attached no particular importance to her other then as a prize he won in battle . He is enraged when she is taken not because he her , but because it is a loss of face in front of the men to be by a king he is unworthy of the title . There is no love interest plot line ( unless you want to suggest a homosexual one between and ). I understand that the writer / director had to condense a lot of material , but a lot of these just don  t make sense . The is not a poem about war . Otherwise , it  t start the narrative nine into a ten year siege that we also don  t see the end of . It  s about human passion and emotion and becoming more human , as well as telling an entertaining story of conquest and battle . It was the action movie blockbuster of its time but still had 1000 % more heart and humanity then the adaptation . Whoever wrote this movie may have read the poem , but they clearly  t understand it . Some nice acting , but a poor job of the story to the big screen .",0

You may be standing in your local supermarket and the man standing next to you could be the welterweight champion of the world . You  t even know . That is the beauty of boxing .

"There been a lot of talk that  Broken  is  s most commercially accessible film to date . One can almost hear muttering something reactionary like  commercial ? That  s just a label . It  s a label that some might associate with  selling out . But selling out does not apply to . He still complete control of his work and is still the only who his own . If  Broken  does break into the , it is nothing overly deliberate . familiar that seem intimate in their tone . He with old while still leaving his open to interpretation .  Broken  is a travelogue and like most , the story is more concerned with the journey but not so much about the destination . Bill Don , a man who we know little about . We know he  s single and we know he  s had some flame  s in the past . The last one just out on him . When Don an anonymous letter from one of these old , he that he a twenty year old son who might be looking for him . Don this is a joke but the advice from a friend to unfold the mystery by down his past . He somewhere to a generic place , a car and his investigation . Each ex an individual personality but most of them share something similar . They are content and have on from the past . One of the ex  s we meet works in real estate and it would be a good idea for her to get into the water business because  one day in the near future it will be more valuable then oil . The atmosphere is awkward and rather then care whether this woman is responsible for the anonymous letter , we just feel like getting out of there . The film  s journey is absurd in many ways because we are never sure what the real point is . What is Don going to do if he does find his son ? This where Bill  s credit as an actor through . We see from his small facial that he is empty , and sad . There is a sense of longing as if life took a wrong turn somewhere and it is only now that he is realizing it . The ending of  Broken  is what really the film special . Don  t expect too much or too little . Just see it . Its inspiring , hopeful and better then any other movie this year . The film also a great by musician , . And we see in the that the film to Jean . Jean made a phenomenal film in the 1960  s titled ,  The Mother and The Whore . He had an influence on and likewise both had an influence on .",1
"This is a fine movie with some wonderful within it . However , it  t have enough of those wonderful to fully flesh it out . It  s a good thing they had those though , because they saved the movie for me . Bill is indeed wonderful and a true pleasure to watch . The few that him to go deep within this character were amazing . He deserved more of those . It  s great to see in true form . She her part wonderfully , as does the always likable . All in all , the movie is a nice attempt at being a brilliant movie . But it  s   are too far between . The ending which should have been a moment , was a miss for me . It  s worth seeing though .",0

And his motivation for turning to the dark side ? He dreamt his wife was going to die , so what  s the first thing he does as ? Try to kill his wife , naturally . This is just so idiotic . And the rip off scene was ludicrous , I mean his life was saved , he got a brilliant new outfit to wear and then he out a Principal Skinner  ! he should have  ! I could go on and on ( and probably have a bit ), I suppose I enjoy disliking this movie . And when I watch the 3 original I will wonder what made turn to the dark side , it certainly  t happen the way told it . The only winner is C3PO , he got his memory erased .",1
"From the maker of Dog this film a lot of the same . A group of twenty something like to live life on the edge . Following from a tragedy after a previous outing they embark on a pot holing expedition . Instead of visiting an easy cave they embark on a trip to an uncharted cave that conveniently a track to the entrance . For me the film is at its best in the first half that really the ( few ) and ( many ) of pot holing . I tried it several ago and found it a thoroughly horrible experience . I was therefore squirming at several of the early . Once the cave a few unexpected the film into normal territory as the desperately try to find the open air . If you like your horror to have lots of blood you  love this one . It  s never dull and well worth a if you ever think about going pot holing .",0

He was great and really nice to look at . I his voice better than the Phantom , by Butler , but all 3 leading were super . I have the music from the stage production over the , but never seen it on stage . The music was the best element in the film , but artistically and cinematographically great too . It was a feast for the , and heart . The now  The Sound of Music  for 1st place in my list .",0
"I can  t say I  m a fan . However , this collaboration with Bill brought the best out of both of them . Bill is just amazing anyway . His acting the viewer in to his world . The saying  less is more  . with the same idea and silence to act in this film . The mood the stark film quality and story give all the room to breath . Every scene is an evolution into unfolding feeling . Basically , this film written for  s acting style . Yet  s character is at first with almost totally non - vulnerability you want him to open up . But all the time you see of him doing just that and then you even appreciate his stuck - ness . All the other are wonderful as well . I have seen Stone  s acting as someone trying to hard , but people , she was just crazy and alive in her role in this film . She my mind .  s performance is just perfect . What a woman . All in all I must give this film 2 up and my big are it as well . Funny , thoughtful and very entertaining . Bravo .",1
"** SPOILER AT PLOT PATTERN ** With like fight club setting the bar for this type of plot twist thriller , I don  t think this film it . I  m an enormous Bale fan and a major fan of this sort of film , that feasible for normal people to become the most shadow of themselves . Throughout the movie , there is an obvious and pending plot twist as you watch rip himself apart but the director made us wait too long . The plot twist is powerful but not worth the period of boredom , since its quite obvious what is and is not real , watching the that completely imagines becomes tedious . It  s definitely worth a watch for of Bale and the genre . The plot twist is enlightening and agreeable but its the sort of movie you  want to take a break in the middle of .",1
"With  Dark Water , I  m convinced that there a fundamental difference between Japan and the US as to what a narrative . True , this is an remake of the hit . It furthermore a bit of a tenuous position to decry foreign of horror as a native of a country responsible for nearly a dozen about a homicidal hockey goalie . But , along with the two  Ring  and  The Grudge ,  Dark Water  to be a deliberate test of how much silliness we  tolerate in a film . Based on the overall box office of these so far , the current answer to be somewhere in the neighborhood of  quite a lot . The of  Dark Water  will be familiar to anyone who  s seen any of the previous of boo . There  s an ornery ghoul , a daughter with a worrisome  imaginary  friend , and plenty of frightening moisture . Perhaps the notable absence of any or within which these operate is the very thing that interpret as . To me , though , the water of a washing machine turning black , for example , is not inherently chilling . Odd , perhaps . An annoying inconvenience , certainly . But any to the contrary , I  m unlikely to spend much time worrying that it could in fact be an indication of an unruly underage aqua - phantom in the apartment above me ; a demon that can not only follow my daughter to school , but can wreak havoc with property as well by otherworldly wet on my unsuspecting ceiling . A movie with no central conceit nothing at stake for us . The of  Dark Water  have no impact ; they occur because they can , not because they must . Indeed , for someone who most of the film by what she are plumbing , and dealing with her daughter  s rocky adaptation to her new school , is surprisingly ready to make an abrupt leap into the supernatural by the film  s climax .  Dark Water  is like a feature - length trailer ; full of enticing and creepy imagery that you hope will be fleshed out in the film . The horror invasion no of , and I  m still waiting .",1

The only reason for his presence in the movie is that he is considered to be handsome or what . Yet , there is one good thing in this film : the director could choose a good partner for M . M .: .

"i this movie a lot . i thought all the principle did a great job . Russel was of course great as always . he came off as a great super hero and a good dad as well . was pretty funny as coach boomer . the thing that really me was the character arc of warren peace . in the beginning you think that he night be a villain but he turns out to be a good guy . more of a anti hero type . the  save the citizen scene was also quite good . the audience i saw it with . i love super hero so to me it was refreshing an adolescent spin on this genre . i also was amazed at how many different they came up with . so over all this was a really cool movie .",1
"Here is a question . The movie is set in a high school , what are the that you will see someone locked in a locker ? There are two , one is hot and on is your friend . Of course , I knew which one he will end up with , but I did not not know it will happen that quickly and that trivially . Do you generally feel an incredible suspense when a movie character is trying to cut a wire in order to prevent some type of a disaster and does not really now which wire to cut ? If yes you may actually enjoy this movie . Maybe school cafeteria , in which the main character to sit at a table with cool and not at the table with his , break your heart ? Then go and watch this movie . It is just plain flat . You can pretty much predict what next . The main character is a whose are , but he any , or I should say , does not know his . In like that , you know right away that he should discover some of those eventually , but usually one should expect some sort of struggle , some twist , or other surprise that would give him those . In  Sky High  it is simply banal - he just them . Well ... I am sorry , to be exact I should say ( not without an irony ) that he actually does have to fight to get them . Worst part is there is almost absolutely no humor other that you hear in a typical  s comedy . The only thing close to being funny was the  s father remark about the guy with six arms . I was to see so many praising this rather mediocre picture . I can suggest one simple game you can play when reading the of the people who gave this movie 9 or 10 . Can you tell which are truly sincere and which are written by ? Which do you think are written by professional ? I usually give mediocre a mediocre vote , but I gave 1 to this one since it is really the top of mediocrity .",0

Last year was a golden year because there were two brilliant , Napoleon Dynamite and Garden state . Both of them had exceptional un - orthodox , brilliant comedy and unforgettable . I could watch over and over again . Garden state is a movie any self respecting 20 something person should see , and for the rest of you , if you like irony and sarcasm with no comic book this is the place to go . It  s so refreshing to see a young film maker use his own un orthodox script . This movie is not made like the average formulaic script and because of that it clearly most that are made .",1

I mean a one million dollar budget for a horror film made in , usually trouble . Damn me if it  t one of the best horror / I  ever seen . Take out average acting and this movie is sensational . That camera flash scene is so clever I wish I had thought of it . I can understand why so many people out , as early on this movie is pretty horrific . However I believe the movie is worth it , and if you are one of those people always about , remember that this movie was directed , written and in by two very talented young .

"This movie was interesting . Firstly for 20 it is hard to even watch Bale without feeling ill . Losing 28 must have like a good idea at the time , but surely one visit to the mirror and the man he was in trouble . After getting over that sick feeling your watching someone about to die , I really to evaluate the movie . It very arty , with an almost blue tinge to it . It me of Fight Club , Memento and Requiem for a dream at times . There was a melancholy underneath everything that Bale did . I sat by the movie , but in the back of my mind I kept thinking sure it  s a beautiful movie to watch , and sure Bale is brilliant as always , but is it really a special movie . I was unsure for most of the last half hour , until the end came , and then I  d known I had just seen a very special movie . It was unoriginal in an original way , and I  m so glad I saw it .",1

Probably not for everyone but it  s only an hour and half , just take chance you  laugh a few times for sure then you can complain how bad it was later . Bob and Pollack , priceless ! Enjoy it for the . Enjoy it for the ( is that a word ). Enjoy it for what it is , don  t read into it and next time you  re around a bunch of comic  s listen and relate .

"After reading the 5 and loving them , listening to the original radio series and loving it and seeing the old - series and , well , liking that a bit ( there  s something about low - budget ), along comes the movie .

Right off the bat it butchering the dry wit of the book by the scene where in front of the , and then goes downhill from there . It that the decided to cut a lot of from the book to save time , yet ADD completely new stuff that nothing to do with anything . As an example : I can  t recall ever reading about being by the for , thereby forcing the rest of the crew to come save her . Nope . I wonder where the hell that came from . Yet another : And I surely don  t recall ever hearing about getting one of his cut off in order get the to - where Deep Though apparently to ( for some odd reason ). And deep thought as well . Ah yes . Now I wonder which page all this is on . And it just goes on and on and on with this complete disregard for the and the excellent humor within , an easily digested movie with and so thin you get paper from them .

"As a movie , i  t much . You get the idea of how mediocre the director is when u see only the preview of  The transporter ... and the few other the fellow made . The reason i watched the movie was for Jet li , who as usual made a good performance in action .( but still have to work on acting ..) and Thanks to Morgan Freeman , who brought his quality to such oh so poor movie . This is sad to say , but although studied film making in , this man sadly cannot tell a story , and Unleashed is full of inconsistency and awkwardness .( I wish i could advise him to return to school ) About  s credit on writing , there  s no much quality about it neither .

"( watched in ) Based on the life of heavyweight champion ( ), Man is a semi - fictional tale told in simple , good old fashion narrative form , a story on courage and human dignity in face of adversity . After a brief opening scene of at the height of fame and fortune , the movie no time is plunging him right into the during the Depression era , when , suffering from a broken hand , he can hardly bring in enough to feed his family , working as a longshoreman . Director does not shy away from taking us very slowly , in this 2 - and - a - half - hour movie , through the most desperate of and Mae ( ) . The second half of the movie is on  s miraculous comeback ,  from the to for the heavyweight championship title within a year  thereby becoming the inspiration for people losing all hope during the depression . One could look at this movie as a period piece , against the backdrop of the Depression era ( and many have it to  ). Man however can be without any period reference . Poverty is universal . Not wanting to part with one  s family is universal . Courage and human dignity are universal . With so many pugilistic that have gone on before ( even had  ) you would really wonder what could do to make his finale memorable . Well , he did it by going all out , all the . In addition to what is happening in the ring , we see  s in a basement cell listening to the radio broadcast of the match , against their mother  s explicit prohibition ( but soon by and , and a mother ). We also see  s around the radio in as well as in church , and in the latter case the priest shadow - boxing at the critical , completely absorbed in the match . These cross have a multiplier effect ( pardon an economic term ) on what we see happening in the ring , pushing the audience to one emotional height after another , in a gloriously uplifting finale . But the fight is actually over at around the middle of the movie . When so low as to go , cap - in - hand , to the plush club where his former have to beg for nineteen so that his do not have to be sent away to live with , he ironically the pinnacle of his dignity . The movie clearly this , as we see after this scene a man in , confident , truly cheerful but gentle and loving as ever . He already won the fight . is not among my male but this all - goodness persona he adopted for this movie is truly likable . Inimitable solid support and good chemistry with . Better still is the spark between and his manager . The relationship is somewhat similar to ( but not entirely alike ) that between Clint and Morgan Freeman  s in  Million Dollar Baby , a professional relationship forming the basis of genuine friendship . If I were a betting man , I would put my money of getting at least a best supporting nomination for this year  s , if not winning it .",1

"The film is a mess -- again .  Cursed  on so many and this suit . In our jaded times , we as audience will not succumb to the B - grade horror which could make a poor movie digestible twenty ago . Not today though . There is no direction in a mud puddle . We see no force driving the movie to its foregone conclusion . We  re not all on the same page people . I am talking about a screenplay that too much time and which simply  t there . Unbelievable acting , fake looking F / X and a general feeling of boredom permeate the film . And as for Murphy , he did a poor job in Batman and that performance here . Frankly , I don  t get the attraction to have for him . None the less , a thrill movie should have some good . And I wonder how quickly this film was made , after it was Foster would be making .",0

"After seeing the trailer to this film back in March , I was eagerly the entire production . But you what they say about watching what you wish for . Horror Craven ( the man behind such modern as  The Last House on the Left ,  Swamp Thing ,  Nightmare On Elm Street  and  Scream , among many ) to do away with his usual blend of blood - dripping , headless , and focus instead on making a psychological thriller . He should have stuck to what he does best , as he  s no . In fact , he  s not even a De Palma . Plot ( Wedding ,  Mean ,  The Hot Chick ) as a hotel executive traveling from to after the death of her ( unseen ) grandmother . Forced to take the late night ( red eye ) flight because of bad weather , she the charming and - handsome ( get it ?!), by Murphy ( Scarecrow in  Batman ), who a drink and ( conveniently ) an airplane seat with her . While these two make goo - goo at one another , for the Director of Homeland Security ( see how topical it is ), to be taken care of in her absence . All is going well with this budding relationship , until take a rather nasty turn and very life is in danger , as well as her father , Joe ( Cox ,  ,  ,  ,  The Supremacy ). Forced to commit a heinous act or lose her dad , several ways to extricate herself from the situation , scribbling a note inside a . ( more topical ) book and writing a soapy note on the aircraft  s bathroom mirror . Unfortunately , her adversary is much and her at every turn . While the jet is in flight , the suspense and we are to some real ( most of which come by trying to figure out what  s going to happen next ). But , like any other flight from to , the plane to land - and when this one does , the plot comes tumbling down with it . Next time , . Craven should base the premise on a flight from , say , to New . Yes , , when the story sea level it becomes nothing more than a goofy series of  Home Alone  and revenge , with the helpless turning into a tigress , while her father a great deal of time lying on the floor . Worst of all , the adversary - so clever and dangerous on the airplane , becomes the single most inept bad guy in film history once he  s on the ground . Political intrigue , assassination , , gun , and other various of violence cannot hide the fact that this is Craven  effort in quite a few .",0
"While gone after the and the campaign in World War over and over again , ad , little been produced the Pacific or the of and who perished there . In fact , only a handful of motion have touched on the subject over the last two , namely Steven  s  Empire of the Sun , Malik  s  The Thin Red Line , and the Cage bomb ,  . The best film in this genre was probably 1957  s  Bridge On The River , which won for Lean and , among , but that was almost 50 ago . Now ( ,  , the series  Tilt ) shed some light on a little - known rescue attempt in the waning days of the conflict in the .  The Great Raid  is a fine little film , smart , patriotic and fairly historically accurate .

Nice composition between , prison camp and the capital of Manilla , where civilian nurse ( ,  Gladiator ,  One Hour Photo ) is working with the underground resistance . This is no  Saving Private , and the acting sometimes leaves a bit to be desired , but the strength of the story , the fact it was inspired by true , and the historical importance of the film , make this one a must - see , even for casual of the genre . It will not make much money , but it was very important that it was made .",1
"Napoleon Dynamite  is , in all , a very funny movie . However , it cinematic construction and composition . Many in the film stray from the story and do not affect the outcome either way , they are simply unnecessary . Even though the movie made very little sense to me , I still found myself coming back for more , watching it several times in one week . As stated in the summary , the film is more like a short film collection . It the story is rolling along nicely and then right in the middle of it we get a short scene that is irrelevant to the movie . It  s monotonous and repetitive . But , it  s hilarious at the same time . I can  t really say why I think this movie is so funny , but once you see it you  understand .",1
"Before getting hold of this film , I read some of the about it on the Movie . I was especially keen to see it because of the fact that it was . There are so few being made these days that I just had to see it . With a score of about 5 out of 10 , it was clear to me that this film was not going to be as good as I had thought it would be initially . I think the opening us to the and their quite well . The central character is . She goes to Cross to catch the last train , but asleep on the platform and it . She wakes up in the empty underground - alone . She up to the station entrance , to get home another method of transport in the early of the morning . Unfortunately , the station is completely locked up and she cannot get out . Suddenly , she a train coming and down the and onto it . The fact that this train is completely empty  t deter her ! As she on , we see a quick blur as someone else onto it as well . The train comes to a sudden stop in the tunnel and the go out . some and goes to investigate . A mysterious figure , who turns out to be someone from  s past - Guy - to rape the girl . As he her , the train are open and Guy is dragged underneath the train and himself . For the rest of the film , the monster thing is after . The people she along the way are all by the monster . Like with all , the monster and to tell her tale . She out of the underground and onto the platform , covered in black muck and holding her dead homeless friend  s dog . As she there , relieved , the platform to fill up with early morning . But although she is happy , she becomes as she towards to the ... I  m guessing there is going to be a follow - up to this film . What disappointed me about this film is the fact that the only underground station they used was used too much . It would have been great if they would have used a second or third as for a way out of the underground .",1
"Very atmospheric , fairly well with only a couple of , Hurt was fantastic , the twist was pretty simple to spot but well executed . Also , to the reviewer that about the lack of ... well , the    t really there as the couple were still alive . If it had been of past however , would have made more sense . Finally , there was the obligatory scene with the heroine taking a shower . I  t but my did :)",0
"Watching the movie is a guilty pleasure like coming upon a car wreck , you can  t turn away ! It the horror , blood and gore aspect without being cheesy . It does borrow from early slasher with a touch here and there of the morality play ( do a bad deed get ) but even that some unexpected . There was more fun in just enjoying the emotional acting than to spend the energy to identify the culprit . The mix of more well known like Glover and Potter secondary and relative in lead was refreshing . Any movie where I catch myself talking out loud to it and exclaiming random got the reaction from my psyche I look for in a film . Worth watching and talking to to see if you both came to the same regarding the ending . If you watch late at night be prepared to stay up after for an hour or so to clear your mind or if you enjoy go directly to sleep , we all have . The mind can dismiss the evil and horror of what is questionable in it  s possibility of occurrence . It is much harder to see the evil that men hold in the hearts and act on and say it  t happen . Highly recommend to those who enjoy being taken to the edge , but watch with someone !",1
"The song it all ,  This is a house built on sin . This movie a somewhat  Massacre  quality to it . But make no mistake , it is an original idea . A group of young are exploring the fascinating little found in rural and come across this clown fellow with a little gas station / horror ride . After learning the legend of . Satan , they decide to pursue . They come across this rather eccentric family of fun loving , and all hell loose . The of this  House of 1000  have their own little that make you fall in love with them , even if they are murdering , he he . Baby this youthful giggle as she in her inhumanity towards her house . She also does an excellent Betty impression , though she  t look like her . The long haired artistic rebel his insane paranoid outlook as he and his mind to do his work . Wait  till you see his art , you  love it . The mother is hospitable but a bit too flirtatious to call a lady . This movie is one wickedly humorous horror film done on a pretty low budget , though not nearly as low as many . I highly recommend this for those who are fascinated by the nature of evil , for this movie certainly it well . Definitely a 9 out of 10 . I look forward to Zombie  s next production .",1
"I call it one of the worst ever because I expect more from a movie with big . I don  t go to see massacre so when a movie this bad under the radar I feel it is my duty to warn people . This is one of those with no likable . I don  t mean the are bad people , I  d have no problem with that , I often root for . I mean they are unlikable . All four of the in this movie are pathetic . They sleep with each other in fashion , meaning are never established . Falling in love place off - screen , though unannounced in time , all we see is fighting . The in logic are amazing , meaning these do not act like normal people , they act like people . All of the the find themselves in are fantastical and not grounded in any kind of reality . I  t watch the whole thing because there was a scene were the two meet and one crying when in real life they would have beaten the crap out of each other . yeah this is one of those where the female lead can  t decide with one of the men she and the two men are both too dumb to drop her like a sack of potatoes , go share a few at a bar and sleep with ANYONE ELSE . ( See  and ) That  t be so bad if the movie gave us any reason to like  s character . I mean , some manage to make you believe that this woman could actually be worth all this trouble , but this is not one of those . Plus Portman is around to be the poor little girl neither guy really but who they both sleep with when they can  t sleep with the other . P . S . Portman is the only one doing any good acting . Please Heed my warning , I really to destroy the copy of this movie that I rented , but I that there are lots of other out there and that one copy  t save anyone the horror of this movie .",1

"Visually this film is delicious from the outset , the black and white are reminiscent of the in  Moulin Rouge , but the actual are quite frankly poor . I am fully aware this is a musical adaptation and some of the were truly such as the roof scene with the Phantom in the , surrounded by , or , he the similarity in some of the , but he to himself as the  Angel of the Night . There were two clear cut  toilet  in this film , where you could leave the cinema , go to the loo , come back in and the film  t on . I appreciate the use of tone and melody to put a point across but at the finale when are rushing and  the choice  she to sing her in Soprano instead of the realistic split second decision that the Phantom is pressing for . The were just stupidly slow moving in and more like a fool than an enchanting young lady , in . The phantom himself almost to shape the into the desired melody but sometimes it felt like they were searching for rather than into song because it should be - more of a case of doing it for the sake of it , and the  Devil Child  circus scene is just ridiculous , as if they  d allow for to be brought up in such a place ! I haven  t seen the musical and have no desire to . And if the Phantom lived in the dungeon for so many - where did he obtain his clothes ? How did he learn to speak with such grammatical correctness , where did he learn to write music and what is he ? The whole thing is just absolutely ridiculous - and as for the  night in shining  he  s more of a wet lettuce than anything to be with . If the Phantom  t just an unfortunate social outcast , then this lad would be cream - ! His voice is so monotonous and yawnful that I  t help but laugh . It  s no wonder is so  weak willed  I would be too just to have a little bit of excitement rather than the  i want to go wherever you go - that  s all i ask ... that  s all you ask ?! Right . One good thing about the singing was that all the ( well , more than you normally can hear in a musical ) could be , well done , but let  s face it , the plot  t exactly hard to follow is it now ? Minnie Driver was the only bright spark in this film and even she was remarkably annoying . The two of the were actually superb in their , and one particular scene was absolutely perfect ( The scene where the Phantom given them all so many , explaining different of his plan ). Furthermore , what would the Phantom need \u00a3 20 , 000 a month for ? And , how can he possibly survive down there ? We  seen that his  t even dare venture down into the dungeon so I highly doubt she made regular to see him . I hate being so pedantic , but the these , and the  t good enough to avoid them . It  s not so  magical  or   or  well shot  to rule out these everyday ! And make of it what you like , but if I  sat through this movie and the first thing I think of is  how does the phantom survive and his monetary  then it for itself ! It  s not all bad . It  s averagely good , worth a watch if you  got a couple of to waste .",1

The peculiar cinematic genius here , of course , and what this film a must - see , is in exactly how and present this phenomenon . The massive , compelling centerpiece of this film is the single , vivid night of our protagonist who , in the most literal sense possible , down his fading of . Thankfully , we have a director who is masterful at cinematic flow of the quirky , so that the convoluted arrangement of , and various are strung together in a complex tapestry that does not quite overwhelm our . We can accept this theatrical style put to new use in a truthful dream logic . For instance , us directly from the trauma at and to reflective conversation in a neighbor  s apartment , in a seamless flow ( the only seam possibly being a door frame , but it  s more of an incidental passage marker ); immediacy to his confusion over that fresh experience , visually within a somber dialogue . And that was just to prepare us for the spectacular night journey to come , been by the series of turning off in the bookstore . An atypical journey , instead of unfolding , they are folding back in on themselves . A multitude of in reverse is a very unique form of storytelling . One more point . It must be a great time to be an actor who to be involved in these of . The of I  m talking about are where a main character , as narrator and guide , take us down a certain path in the story . But then ( typically within the climax of the third act ) it is revealed that this path was unreliable from the start , fantasy , or deception . And so we as the audience have to reach back and reinterpret all the and of at least some of the we think we have come to know . ( Think of the Usual , where in the final series of we are several possible , and so we have to construct several possible out of a single actor ). So the in Eternal Sunshine get to act within at least two possible at the same time , always the that will be later , in a way to convince us of we are not really supposed to be convinced of . Of course its fun to be by sudden in the story , but the real treat is in the acting that is open to interpretation . I have no problem with this being a recent in  edgy  , because it of interaction from the audience . It is one more way for a film to effectively reach out and mingle with our spotted .",1
"*** This comment definitely !!!*** de  s recent movie  Hide and Seek  is , as another commentator stated , a  watchable  movie . Although it is decently made , its failure to become a box office success was due to its script which was rather . The plot line that the central character of the movie turned out to be the real villain is nothing new . Probably it was first used by in her novel  Murder of Roger  approximately eighty ago . Even with the further twist that this central character / villain himself probably did not remember the due to memory suppression , the plot line is still nothing new . Rod and used this kind of plot line ago . ( Some may recall a 1963 Twilight Zone episode  The New Exhibit  in which the central character by Martin Balsam kept on killing and killing but did not remember any of his due to his memory suppression . He blamed the on supernatural by his wax .) Because of this hackneyed plot , the so - surprise ending of this movie was not much of a surprise . The only unexpected thing about the ending of the movie which is worth is the fact that the the to think that this movie was a horror movie in which an apparition was behind all the horrible in the household . The of the movie liberally from the movie  Dark Water  to make the movie look like a horror movie . For example , just like in the movie  Dark Water , 1 ) household of one parent and one child , 2 ) initially revealed himself only to the child and 3 ) to be associated with water , especially to the bathtub . At the beginning of  Hide and Seek , many of horror and similar assumed this movie to be a horror movie , similar to  Dark Water . To the surprise of some of the , the movie turned out to be a suspense movie in which none of the horrible in the movie was supernatural . They were all the of the dual personality of the insane central character by de . Although de did an admirable job the mentally ill psychologist , his acting was not good enough to save this rather script .  Hide and Seek  was merely watchable , but not very unique .",1
"While not a horrible movie ,  Skeleton Key  with its lack of a substantial plot and failure to use its setting to create a spooky atmosphere . The story felt like a rehash of the Reed - film  Burnt , except a lot more predictable . It  s always bad to have the audience out ahead of the protagonist but in the case of this film , the big twist is apparent roughly fifteen into the movie -- and is catch up for the rest of the running time . Hurt is utterly wasted in the role of a stroke victim -- which the question , why cast him ?  t there any wonderful older stage who could have it just as well ? Why put a star in a silent part ?",0
"De is brilliant as usual . Hard to fault him . However it is slightly annoying that whomever wrote this screenplay a big chunk of homage to King . Instead of the Overlook Hotel we have a house on the lake in a very deserted part of the country . Instead of the black chef being by the boy the shining who then comes , we have the little girl the Psychiatrist who comes from a distance but to arrive ( from far away suggesting a continuity error ) in a very short time ( by the time passing in the movie ). Other major are when at the he  s been keeping all this time ( he that they have never actually left the ) and them empty - I  t have been if it had read  All work and no play ... The final chase scene is once again similar to The Shining when he the room door with he knife in his hand . Finally the many he to a dance hall which not like 2004 New Year but more like something from the 1920  s is more than just a bit similar to what is going on in the Overlook  s Gold room ( which oddly enough is also New Year !) It  s The Shining with the removed . Great movie , but really why so blatantly copied from another movie ?",1
"As I watched this movie I felt like I was watching a dozen similar which were haphazardly put together for the sake of a few . The film was not only a sorry remake of the classic film Guess Who  s Coming to Dinner , but was entirely too similar to other Meet the and of other pop which cheaply recycle the old and tired and the introduction of a significant other to uneasy by an all too eager boy / or . Guess Who was a sorry attempt by some to fill in and to sell of . Nothing more . I am tired of movie out the same tired and unoriginal such as Guess Who . Where is the creativity and originality ?",1

As soon as guy said  I  m play me some when i get back home  it was painfully clear he was loosing a leg .

"I almost cried !!!! What have they done to  s masterpiece ?!?!?! I have to confess to being against the idea of a remake of this one since I have seen the original Ring and remake The Ring and was unimpressed with the remake . The whole film was a lot more blatant than it should have been in my opinion , everything was out , there was hardly any tension or chill built up in direct contrast with the original . I had with the use of the bag and coat . The bag and coat were that I had serious with also . In  s stunning masterpiece , a lot is made of the little red bag and it  s reappearance and the fact that the little girl a distinctive yellow mack is well used in the style of Don  t Look Now . One scene in particular where is going up to the roof and the door is open just a crack and you see the in her yellow mack walk past the door . It  s really good . In the remake , both and are seen wearing a red coat and no big deal is made of it . My big problem , as you may have , is the ending (  t it always ). In the version , goes up to the roof and the water tower , she out what and then , after the spookiness of something / someone punching through the tank , goes into the flat to find out on the floor of the bathroom floor . She her up and her to the lift , which get stuck , then there is the tension building moment as the door of her flat open , to see appear , but it  s . Then , a decomposed child , and almost . that there is no point struggling and that the only way to save is to look after . She her and her she is her mother and she at to stay back . Then the lift close and is crying , looking through the window , back for a moment then at . The lift goes up and the music . up the and in the lift shaft . She can  t see anything so she on the floor . Next thing the lift open and is covered in water . It is a truly beautiful and moving scene . You sit there looking at poor little lying in the pool of water , soaked through , sobbing for her mother and your heart just . Remake , in the bath and then is on the phone . She a little girl in a hooded dressing gown walk past here and it  s . She to read her a story and then in the bath . She basically and then goes into the bathroom and to drown . When into the bathroom she to bargain with  what do you want ? . Then she to take her and leave alone . Then you see  s body being carried out , blatantly dead , as opposed to the original where just . The very final scene in the original is 10 later when is in the area where she used to live as she is going to visit a friend . She she can  t remember being at kindergarten , and she herself walking back to her old apartment . There she her mother and they chat , she that no - one told her that her mother was living here and if she can come and live with her . that she is sorry that can  t come and live with her . You then see in the background , behind and when turns around , and both disappear . then  my mother was here all this time , protecting me . It  s a beautiful ending . In the remake , 3 later and her mother to her in the lift . It just  t work . There you go , end of tirade . See them for yourself .",1
"This is one of those that was so over - rated when it was first it is not even funny . It is very interesting to note that even though this film so many Academy , you don  t see it on any critic  s top ten list and it  s not even in this site  s top 250 ! How could this be , you ask ? The answer is that this is a classic example of people over to the greatness of a film before really looking deeply into it . This is not even a remotely accurate portrayal of that during the Titanic  s tragic maiden voyage . Instead , it is just a bunch of tripe put together by an action director . You can tell , there are many out of place witty that simply do not belong in a film such as this . The were annoying and two dimensional and you felt no compassion at all when these people were sinking out at sea . Actually , these people were a bunch of arrogant that deserved to die ! The film simply did not show enough of the poor people in the under to even give a damn about them , they just far too much of Jack and Rose in all their silly Blue . This film really did have potential , it really did , and it  s not even all bad . The second half of the film with the boat sinking is some of the best action ever to be put on film . But this was not enough to save this film from sinking into mediocrity . I have to give props for trying his skillful hand at drama , but man , go back to making action -- that is definitely your strong suit .",1

Important western people working in the entertainment industry ( and they  re ) come to Far East and exploit all the - given they learn , rather than going to explore the local culture and to know the between people . While showing that is a dominant language in Japan , the director that usually go around the world assuming everyone .

Many about Japan and culture have been in this film apart from one , which is the unbelievably expensive living cost there .

There are many special effects over the course of the trilogy and epic battle to put you in awe ( many of which , in my view , do push the of the  - 13  rating ), not because it  s action but because of how precise  s direction is , and how unflinching the camera becomes when it  s time for battle .

One thing is you can not judge every because one or few people in the movie no idea where is or what they have , it is obvious that the director for this movie is an ignorant , due to the fact that if you do not know where the lived , you really need to go back to the and do some study then what type of is spoken in because it is different from other speaking , they speak Castellan . I know for a fact that is a very peaceful country I go there every year to spend my long vacation and every time I have lots of fun with my and never ever had any with no one there in fact people there will definitely know that I  m not from and they treat you like a king .

"The Phantom of the Opera works , in the movie incarnation anyway , because the Phantom is the soul of unrequited love . Since there are darn few of us on this planet who haven  t experienced this , the character is bound to appeal to a whole .

Hopper his and his cheque and the effects do what  s and do it well . The main problem with the film is the familiarity of its genre . It like a rip - off of , ironically , of Romero  s own . Romero  s obsession with one - dimensional military and the story of any emotional pay - off . Baker  s semi - stupid as an obvious on - screen narrator and occasional mouthpiece of redundant exposition . This is not the Romero of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD , the brilliant MARTIN or the downbeat THE . It is the Romero who made the terrible BRUISER .",1
"Yes , I am guilty . I just lied through my teeth and took a 16 year old to  The . We did not sit in the front row and talk through the movie because we were both laughing too hard .

"Hilarious plot ! I really dig Chow  s sense of humor . This movie Matrix  s special effects but with lot more funny . It might appear a little stupid if you are new to Chow  s style . But no , once you get a of his dark humor , you will really enjoy it . After all , he is ranked way up there in Hong entertainment arena along with and Jet Li as far as popularity and gross income are concerned . I this movie a lot more than  House of Flying Daggers , which is a little , and  are unclear . This movie however everybody  s every clear . It just you anxious to find out who is kick whose ass in the end . I also like the love story briefly with the action . The quick of Chow  s character you on his side at early stage of the movie , so that you like his character despite of all the bad he does .

"The most boring movie ever ! I was so sorry that I  t leave the cinema during the break when I went to this movie . I was just waiting the whole movie for something interesting or amusing to happen , what never . Maybe a good moral or something could have made up for that , but that also was something the movie . Plot line of the movie ; a few , a few sick and crazy , a bunch of people who  t dare to speak up to and being boring and disturbed . Boring and even  so - - dramatic -  came off pretty lame . The only people who like this movie are probably the who cannot look back on WO rationally and therefore think every movie about WO / is great / artistic . Well , this one sure  t .",0
"To fully appreciate the greatness of this movie particularly and the trilogy as a whole , you have to watch the extended version of it . I saw it on first and then got the extended version and since that , every time I watch the standard version it like a compact version of the real thing . The regular version is amazing but the addition of some important ( at least for me ) it the best movie of all times . This is by far the best of the three because of the fact that it had to tie all the and finish the story and at the same time be bigger and more intense that it  s . While I still think that the last 15 of two is one of the in the history of mankind , you  never be disappointed in this one . The trilogy itself is just so deep and so perfect , that it  s one of those that make you think about the beautiful humanity is capable of .",1

The use of name and flag without done a proper background research on the country should be . is a beautiful country and is far away from what is pictured in the movie . The good thing is that are very of their country ( as every one should be ) and they will make their voice strong on this topic . a good one will be that the Director of the movie and maybe too , to a visit to the country so they can see how far away from the reality they are . Apart from this , for all the that think that this type of wrong impression given in does not harm , they are very wrong . Most of the people nowadays get to know about different and via . is a very touristic place and this bad image can cost them a lot , but on the other hand the type of tourism that goes to won  t be even close to a movie like this",1

Its like when there is a film that is really cool and everything that is when you people all join together and hate it ! As for the scene between Slater and there was nothing there ! Just a love scene and not what these people say it is and I saw nothing a wrong with her in this film ! This is all my opinion ! I mean the is really good , the movie is very good , the music is very good , and the film is quite interesting and the movie really you going until the end . If you haven  t seen this film and if you like Slater , Tara , , Frank C .

I don  t have space to discuss that --- but , I do NOT agree with how they those two .... thanks , for not standing up for at all ! Also , the convoy ....

Prior to going over there myself , we had NUMEROUS , upon NUMEROUS convoy classes ( I was a part of an ambulance company ). you would NEVER pull over -- off the road . COME ON !! are not that stupid , . I think the of this show really need to get people that we actually over there -- people that we on the front ... ESPECIALLY people at Walter Reed .

Now the story had some real potential to be interesting and scary but potential  t enough to carry the movie . The beginning was WAY to long and the middle was and the end WAY to short , the ending kind of just on your lap and then you get up and leave the theater . It all either to fast or to slow and nothing was REALLY so you leave the movie disappointed and confused .

"Broken , I guess , is supposed to be this long , contemplative film about a man  s journey into his past to discover how his life and history of added up . Initially , the film is structured as a mystery - as Bill  s character to find the old who bore his son , but it  s more about the journey than the destination . But , to me , this movie was one of the most boring I  ever sat through . There are an endless number of - long of Bill driving a car by himself . There are several of him sitting alone in his living room , listening to the stereo and thinking . A couple of these , where the could be meaningful and carry depth , would be fine in a film like this , if the film carried more weight or gave  s character more of a background than  a bemused , aging Don . Instead , once the movie , I felt like it several good where with the old and about 30 of dead air . Why , why , WHY were there four done as drove a down a country road ?  t one shot establish the plot point as much as is necessary ? I get it . He  s driving . Oh , and I figured out that  s character was an aging Don within the first five , when he  s watching the movie about Don . I  t need to have call him  Don , then have Wright call him  Don , then have everyone comment on how his name is Don . I get the point . Don  t hammer it into the ground . This is not a good movie . If it across - the - board good , I  be . It  s pretentious , meaningless and  t go very far . It  t function as a mystery . It  t function successfully as an illustration of a character .

"I am a Operation Freedom veteran in the Navy as a combat medic for the . 1stf all I thought it was pretty cool to see a show of what is going on in , but some of the that I saw were just crazy and not making sense . I honestly think that they should hire some and tell them how to do the show . I know that it is an Army show but I think that the have a better way of showing how it is really done . I don  t believe that everyone in the Army , it just so dumb to do that . Also , that Scream he would of gotten shot by his platoon if he ever did that in real life you just don  t start screaming to your people who are doing your job . Plus you don  t know what they might be thinking and going through and then we have  friendly fire . In the first episode when they were in the mosque they should of for air support and they  t of been there for so many days getting . I think that this show needs to show what all are doing  over there , not just the Army singing and trying to figure each . I do applaud that they did put some realistic where the wife is cheating on her husband and family . I also that nothing was dirty in the desert .

"I remember seeing a preview for this movie a long time ago . It  t very long but it really cool . I finally got to see the movie , in . 2005 , but I  t realize it was a musical . And I absolutely ! But as soon as they took the sheet off the chandelier and the Overture I was hooked . 1 ) to be Webber at his best . These are amazing and will get stuck in your head . The orchestral music is amazing as well as the singing . The are different from the stage version , but I like these better . There are also 2 new written specifically for the movie : Journey to the Cemetery and The Fairground . There is also a that was not in the play and a new song Learn to Be Lonely by Minnie Driver at the end of the movie . 2 ) Cast In my opinion , the casting was perfect . of the stage - version probably won  t agree with me on that , but , oh well . I  m glad that all the , except Minnie Driver , did their own singing I  start with as . She the most amazing voice . I  sing , and I think that  s voice is much better . She  s also perfect , acting wise , for the innocent , naive , and ignorant role of .

Now that I  watched it about 100 times , just and . The girly hair , the funny facial and the whole  Genius turned to madness  line make me laugh every time I watch the movie . The Phantom - Butler is my favorite phantom . His voice is perfect for this version of the phantom , who  s supposed to be seductive and sexy . The fact that he like an Bloom sundae smothered in sauce  t hurt either . . His performance me feel sorry for the phantom ( I cried when he broke the ), and it also made facial and behavior sexy . - My favorite character . She  s absolutely hilarious .

"With breathless propaganda on one side and jaded boredom on the other , it  s hard to make or of the so far . I personally think it  s a solid , surprisingly film . It some logic , and Cox is woefully , but it  s otherwise a fine way to spend some time in the theater . I saw it tonight at an advanced screening , and it to be a crowd pleaser . People , , , and . I think the camera was just about glued to the whole time , but that  s not so bad because she  s very attractive . The film style is pretty for most of the film , and Craven was meticulous in the of human nature and how people really interact . His grasp of behavior for some very authentic and entertaining , and he on each scene the - , resulting in some satisfyingly fist - shaking to their sub - . It  s also amazing how much plot and characterization he was able to pack into a relatively short film . Red Eye is dense with detail , and you really have to keep your on the screen the whole time if you want to keep up . His career been all over the map , quality - wise , and I  m glad to see him finally move away from high concept , market - tested alt - rock , random of Young Beautiful People as his , and embarrassingly . It  s almost as if someone else directed the film , chose the material , and the cast . I Murphy to be competent , but I was really by . I haven  t seen The Notebook yet , but I think this will be her breakout role . I found her harrowingly convincing , up until the end . While I see her from the director  s point of view , I don  t think the depth of her was sufficiently established for me to fully believe she could do what she ended up doing . I think the problem is that Craven is just not used to this kind of territory . Hopefully he  keep at it , though , because this is the best film of his I  seen since the original Scream . Unfortunately , by the list of he  s on track to produce , this like a thematic one - off for a career .",1

I own at least one movie that at least one member of the cast in it so most of the are familiar to me . Minnie Driver , , all star in I own and I  seen Butler in a movie . The Music - I fairly the music . It  s probably the one thing that got me attached . I  read that some people thought that Butler  s voice was pretty much , pathetic . However , to me I love it .  s is beautiful . Much more beautiful than my own and my think I have a great voice . , his voice the pretty boy that I  from most of my Phantom . The Acting - As usual the acting is sublime . That  s all I have to say really . , Design , and the what not - The are very extravagant , excellent , but to me it  s a bit overdone .

"What a brilliantly funny , , strange trip  Napoleon Dynamite  is . The central character , , is perfectly cast as a lovable but chronically goofy high school and the supporting cast is equally outstanding to maintain a deadpan tone throughout the entire motion picture . Unfortunately ,  Napoleon Dynamite  is a film that you  either  get  or you wont ! There  s no middle ground here . But if you give this movie a chance , you  be with a strong point of view , a social conscious and bold about our culture , and in a much context , about this strange , wonderful , twisted journey we call life . A journey where people do and say strange and where ambition or action might not to a higher level or contribute to mankind . Napoleon  s absurdity the idea that life on this planet is here to primarily be -- to simply exist . Why film have been so hard on this movie , when torturing us with mindless and , old and with little or no improvement , is beyond me . Sure there  s . We  all seen and from  Napoleon  in other . As well , the tone  t entirely unique . But along with  s  Life Aquatic with , Napoleon a new comedic strain , one that is more biting , more clever , and more soul searching than an average teen comedy . So watch the film and don  t worry about it  s low pulse or that it  t follow typical structure . Enjoy  Napoleon Dynamite  for what it is and what the intended . A smart , funny study on the weirdness of humanity and the beauty , connection and warmth that that weirdness .",1

"I went to see a preview of this film last week before its general release in the as Green Street next month and seen some good of it on here , I went with some quite high . I can  t complain about the acting , but the and some slight left me a bit disappointed . It was difficult to believe that  pretty boy  Wood would ever get involved in a Fight Club - style street brawl ; , whilst a good actor , does the most unconvincing accent since Dick Van Dyke ; and the dialogue and the singing at the end made me feel I was watching an version of a story , rather than feeling involved in it . Other such as   actually being , hooligan in Bank where in fact nothing at all at , Bank not an overground platform and   being a dead ringer for Street station did nothing to draw me into the film . Other say they find it difficult to believe how a can get drawn into football and its so easily , but as a football fan it  s easy to understand . What  s not so easy to understand is why a group of football would accept a wet - behind - the - who  s never been in a fight and his major as History . Overall the film was entertaining , but for a audience some of the dialogue is far too corny and to be believable . The Football Factory does the same job much better , with better , better story and more humour . Check that out instead .",0

What the film somewhat refreshing is that it is a mix of comic book with adolescent angst and the they endure as teens all done with cheeky aplomb and surprisingly keen to how teens interact with one another and more importantly their . , who cut his baby teeth on ( which this film is a product of by the way ), with his wide cut , high cheek , dimple and kiss - curl pompadour is perfect casting as an old - school superhero ( replete with cheesy costume ) and actually for a change than her usual dishwater logged turns lately , as the are a match made in heaven , with equal humor ( I out loud when , in a fit of anger , a phone , only to open the kitchen drawer and a new one from a dozen standing by in just that case of circumstance ) and know - how ingenuity ( when the villain Royal Pain is finally revealed it is shrewdly to in a subtle line of dialogue ). It  s also nice to see the shapely , remarkably well - Carter as the high school  s principal who actually at one point ,  I  m not Wonder Woman , you know ? What the film fun is the enjoying themselves largely thanks to the breezy direction by Mike and a smartly funny screenplay by , and Mark ( the latter duo of the animated series ,  Kim Possible ) and the production design by Hill and the colorful by ( sort of Nickelodeon ) all not taking itself too seriously and plainly a guilty pleasure not since last year  s animated fare  The , which this inevitably is being against ; and \u0096 both are ultimately fantastic family fare . It  The Fantastic Four  for what that film , and heart .",0
"Like the first two , this movie an embarrassing screenplay by everything between small furry to large . Some nice are  good with the I have ,  no its because I  m in love with you  and  !!! Now this is where Revenge of the Sith is different and decidedly much better than the first two . Instead of just on the constant path of terrible dialogue and plot , probably about 1 1 / 2 good for every terrible line or moment . That extra half scene is what this movie so much better . It that for every hollow or badly - directed scene is another 1 1 / 2 surprisingly effective and emotional . I thought overall the acting was much better in this film , specifically . I  t a huge fan of him in the other , but I though he was outstanding in . He made it easy to tell where his character was going in relation to when you see Alec for the first time in A New Hope . He also like he was a lot of fun . And at the end , after Obi Wan and  s final duel , he was what made that scene more powerful ( what could have made the scene even more powerful is if the other 2  t suck so much ). Another good performance was by as Chancellor . You could tell that the character was less eager to hide his evil ways now and was getting ready to uncover his plan that would ultimately lead to the Galactic Civil War in the old trilogy . Now there are possible plot , but it really on how powerful you believe the force to be . Because if can feel if other are dying and what other people are thinking ,  t have they been able to uncover a conspiracy to kill all the ??? I  m really not sure , maybe the dark side of the force clouded their . There are other dumb too . When to choke at the end ,  t she the entire reason why he went to the dark side , to save her ? You could argue that he was completely under the influence of the dark side by then , but then as soon as he into his suit , like  ? But like I said , for every bad scene is 1 1 / 2 good . The opening space battle , while not as exciting as the one in , is very fun and when Obi Wan and get into the command ship , it very like the old . The extermination scene is very emotional , and throughout the movie there are several that exist between this movie and in the old .  s music is as good as ever . I can  t say I the music in Attack of the , mostly because I  t really like the one new theme ( across the ) but in this movie he several that are very good . So overall , Revenge of the Sith is not a great movie . It is merely a very good movie . But a very good movie is ..... very good , which can  t be said for the last 2 , which that much .",1
"This movie was depressing to both me and my husband . It left us in a bummer mood . I never thought about being too old to be  s dad , it  s not unusual to see an older man with a young child . Actually nowadays it  s very common with / . I would rather see that then the leading man being 65 and the leading lady 25 if you know what I mean . Or a sexy young woman who is a nuclear fusion / fission genius or museum curator . But Hide and Seek had the usual  rich people life  twist - when an awful thing in your house , you must move somewhere else and start life anew . But why would you move someplace so out in the country , away from the bustling city ? like the would be even more depressed leaving all her old , school , life , . behind . Then had the physician syndrome ,  even though I am licensed professional , I cannot help my own child . Fanning was , but I have seen her in better . ( and yes , I have recently seen War of the and thought she was great and believable ). I can  t fault the , she probably was taking from off camera . I found her constant freezing up and weird and odd . It me of , but did it much better and much colder ago . I love in his other , perhaps he was trying a new slant . After all , now he  s doing comedy ! I never want to see this again , it depressed me badly . I like to see a movie for entertainment , not a black cloud feeling . Sorry , but this is the best I can do . I do try to write a fair review and like / Fanning in other . Love the , it great background on and .",1
"For some odd reason is the only place were this movie is being . In most this movie  t even got a theatrical release or was only shown in a very limited amount of and only for a short period . There is a very good reason for this for  Equilibrium  simply is not a good movie . It really is nothing more than an average B - science - fiction movie and on top of that it  s terrible unoriginal . Especially when you  seen like  451 ,  1138 ,  1984 ,  Metropolis ,  Blade Runner ... must I really go on ? Basically there is no movie in the science - fiction genre were this movie  t   heavily from . The concept itself of the movie  t that terrible and the movie of quite promising but the movie never really becomes interesting after that point and the story predictable and  t always flow well . It  s obvious that director still some learning to do when it comes to storytelling . Yes the movie does deserve praise for its visual look . It  s obvious that the movie  t had a terribly high budget and I must see that they handled this well and made the best out of it . The fight scene  s are fairly good but simply too much over - the - top to find it really entertaining or believable . Also the ending heavily and overall the movie leaves a bad aftertaste . Bale on the other hand is simply cool and wonderful in his role and he a good main character / hero . Bean also a quite good role but don  t be people , his role is very limited , the same goes for . Quite frankly I don  t see what this movie got to distinct itself from other B - science - fiction . It a unlikely and silly handled story that never really well and the action leaves a pointless impression . Yes not a lot of people are going to agree with me on this but in my opinion the were absolutely right this time . You  re way better of watching a real science - fiction classic and masterpiece such as the I above . This movie  t even good or entertaining as a science - fiction action movie . In my humble opinion this movie is only still watchable thanks to Bale . 5 / 10http :// bobafett1138 . . /",1
"I  always admired  s laconic screen presence , in BULL , TIN CUP , even WITH , and PERFECT WORLD . Now no longer leading - man handsome , he  s into a first - rate character actor , and as a washed - up , alcoholic ex - baseball player - turned radio talk - show host , company and comfort to as a drinking buddy in the bittersweet THE UPSIDE OF ANGER . Mike Binder  s superb film about an abandoned wife of four teenage should qualify as one of this year  s best . But because it was so early , did only respectable business , and  t a vehicle for an over - box - office attraction on magazine now , it will probably only get the respect of word - of - mouth . I saw this engrossing , deeply wonderful film when it last winter , and made up my mind that I would have to have the as soon as it available . , as Terry us in a performance that is both comically and dramatically masterful as the drunken mother seemingly at war with her four beautiful . Terry  s rage over her husband  s abandonment of her and their , is a mean - spirited rebuke to her , who try with great patience to survive their mother  s theatrical bitterness . But given them the gift of her humor , and I think it  s what these . There  s a look that when one of her is doing exactly what she  t want them to be doing . What it is they are doing to upset their mother is always in doubt because she  s never really making rational sense . She  s only filtering her displeasure through the rheumy of her last cocktail . There  s a scene at the family dining room where , her eldest daughter ( the ever fascinating , who should be starring in her own ), she  s pregnant with her second baby . was none - to - happy that her daughter for marriage and motherhood over a career , and her beady - eyed stare at her daughter  s latest announcement of her grand - motherhood is a comic masterpiece . But when finally can no longer avoid facing her crippling anger , your heart . never had an outlet for her comic , she  s you with her skill . That she this fine tightrope between both much for her talent as an actor . Finally back to . might have been a dangerous character for to revisit . , he  s washed up or out sports before . His career a very precipitous fall following the media - debacle of his so - grandiose ego in , and the have been few and far between since then . But is a rich character any actor would love to sink their teeth into , and  s humanity with consummate ease . his neighbor been abandoned by her husband , to keep her company while they drink . They warily circle each other during these boozy afternoons of watching television , drinking and not saying much to each other . And when that , you see the transition from friend to lover mainly through the of . When she first they sleep together , it  s who out at the last minute . But as their relationship , you see reach out to Terry  s in a way that is sympathetic but also them room to accept and then love him in return . This is a terribly important test for . So when the of the finally him if he to marry Terry , comes to understand that the have him into the family . is sensational in this film , but he it all so low - key , always keeping the focus on  s character , and he up giving her the film -- and rightfully so , I think . This is a gift to . this , and I think the movie is all the better for his act of generosity . This is a performance that people will talk about for to come . Like Jeff and , is one of our best screen , and it  s great to see him in a role that is truly worthy of his fine talent . Each of the daughter  s is skillfully by , Wood , Russel and . These young look and act like . Mike Binder given himself a role as  s radio producer , who is romancing one of the , much to her mother  s disgust . He  s funny , pathetic , and just a bit creepy as a with romantic way above his station ! Binder  s fine script this ensemble film the ballast that you laughing and crying . He  s found the emotional core in these character  s , and the pace of the film , which in at just under two , a sense of completeness . Ultimately it is  s generosity as an actor that so the viewer . In every shot ,  s Terry is the riveting center , with to her every moment without stealing attention away from her . That my whole - hearted respect . THE UPSIDE OF ANGER should be seen and savored by anyone who deeply about with something to say about the human condition . Binder  s adroit direction this a film to set beside OF ENDEARMENT , AS GOOD AS IT , and  s vastly SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT . Finally it  s such a pleasure to see two such as and hit it right out of the park !",1

"I found this movie entertaining though I admit not the best movie ever made . The are not original and it a bit like a black soap opera but for a FIRST movie by black playwright / author / producer / actor , new comer to ,-- Perry , it was good enough to earn him a second try . What is original is Perry  s ability to successfully walk the tightrope between telling a story of serious life / relationship and at the same time with the outrageous humor of his alter - ego , pistol , sharp - tongued , granny -   ( Perry in drag ). He Murphy ( )/ Martin ( Big ) humor to draw in the non - world to his supporting not only , but universal moral that lead to better for all . He the adult humor clean enough to keep PG13 rating and there is little if any , and no sex . Another treat was seeing the regal Cicely in her first movie role in 10 is a story about a black woman ( with beauty by ) done wrong by her successful but abusive lawyer husband ( ) and her dilemma on how to deal with the disgrace of a divorce after being married for 17 . In the she help from her grandma   and other family and the laughter  cause don  t take no mess ! Perry he  s just as good as Murphy / by 3 in the movie PLUS he wrote the movie and let them use his own mansion - of - a - home in to shoot in as the house of the lawyer . Expect more to come from Perry b / c he comes with a base fan club of nationwide ( mostly ) who have seen and his very successful for in across .. Now he should garner more through / -- because his are universal about family , love and how to make it in this world no matter what nationality or race .

"Sky High is a terrific movie for the 9 - 13 age group , but anyone can really enjoy it . For a movie , it fairly good acting and a great concept . Older may not go for the action ( it is very unrealistic , though the special effects are excellent ), but a love story that the of high school is in the story . It was several funny , but it is mostly just good fun for younger . The are around the right age , so it really it seem realistic . It  s a cute movie that pretty much needs to be seen . I would highly recommend Sky High to anyone who is looking to have a fun time at the !",1
"It  s a movie , GOSH ! I don  t think the ( s ) set out to create a classic , and no , this movie is not a classic . But I found it to be sweet at its core . I  t see any of the  post modern cynicism / disdain for humanity  and on and on that a number of other about . Though the was rather slow , neither did I feel to fall asleep . I watched with my , 14 and 12 , and Napoleon  s speech definitely me somewhat of theirs . We were all able to enjoy the movie , and we all almost throughout the entire thing . Perhaps the key to enjoying this movie is watching it with . Perhaps I  t have nearly as much as I did if I  d watched alone . I can  t say for sure . I agree with those who state that the plot is weak or almost not there at all . The music a sort of cheesy , cheap quality - but for this movie , it all works . Almost all of the humor is in the , and not so much in the . There is an abundance of true crap out there - mindless violence , formulaic chase , that appeal to potty humor . is a small movie with a good heart . All of the invective seem to be dumping on it on this message board way over the top . If you don  t like it , then you don  t like it . I could name many of , some of which were huge commercial , that are much more deserving of the sort of harsh criticism received from many people here .",1
"This movie is a winner on most . is amazing as the depression - era fighter ; his manager - by is effective ; and his own against both . Even ( who I sometimes find to be a bit affected ) as his wife , her and is very good . While something could be said about not really showing  who  was , by all he was an uncomplicated man devoted to his family . So possibly , the movie was factual in not showing more . But the criticism is minor , and in all actuality does not take anything away from the film . And even though I knew the outcome , the suspense still built up in the final , and provided a crowd pleasing ending that was not in the least bit , maudlin , or false . anther fine film , and once again ( as if he to ) that he is a major directorial talent .",1
"The problem with this movie is that it to be funny once the premise is revealed . The joke really dirty --- get it ? Now listen for another hour and a half as say all of the dirty you already thought up when you your  obscenity maturity  at around , oh , eighteen . Incest , various sexual , feces , . Those are funny when you  t them . For example , in the South Park movie , I remember actually being at how many were in the  and  movie - within - a - movie . It was a cinematic first for me , and I . But in this movie , once you have a fairly dirty version of this joke , you are anything and everything . In fact , the only funny version of the joke ( in my opinion ) was told by the South Park in the second half of the movie . It was funny because it something that was actually surprising -- in other , something that probably even offended some people who came to the movie knowing for the most part what it was about . Other than that , the only interesting aspect of this movie was that it as an unwitting empirical investigation into the self - indulgence and self - aggrandizement of the stand - up world . Another user  s comment me of a thought I had during the movie -- that this whole thing might be a hoax , a joke on to see how many people would laugh at something so clearly not funny . In fact , during the movie I kept wondering if we  t going to all be told at the end ,  ! ... pass it on ! That would at least explain A . O .  s ( Times ) ridiculously positive review . Needless to say , we  t . But hoax or no hoax , since this is a review of the movie , I guess my stand -- it was irritating .",1
"Wow ... where do I to start ? I generally stay away from that don  t involve the main creative team behind the first one . , , director ... But this one had me from the first frame ... The series been the sub - cultural Bond franchise . While it  s true that this franchise all of the classic Bond it  s the main and their that these different than your standard secret agent film . 1 . You  got your than life one - liner spewing hero ... Cage , stone . Their are usually akin to their very different . Cage was into extreme sports and . Stone was an ex Navy seal and car thief . 2 . Then comes the action in the form of narrow , massive usually against overwhelming odds and then there  s always some hand to hand combat . Some people have accused actor Ice Cube of not looking the part but I don  t have that complaint . He is an action movie veteran done of so I  t too worried . Seeing him step up to the plate and doing his own made it even better for me . He did some pretty thrilling action . 3 . Now we have my favorite part of both the Bond and the ... Dramatic pause ... The yep , that  s right the Bond . We had one girl ( ) in the first movie our so naturally our total in this one . ( Sunny ) us in classic Bond girl form that  t be . She  s got her beauty , A smile capable of melting most men where the stand , and of course a very lethal piercing stare . All which are used as in this film and yet she  t use her sexual whiles as overtly as say Xenia from Goldeneye . And then there  s Ice Cube  s ex . The beautiful car thief / chopper . Forgotten pain , and sexual tension with cube were the she used and she was on his side ... go figure . All in all I thought 2 was a pretty cool thrill ride from start to finish . If I had to take off it would to be for the bad , ( Note to the film : Think photo realistic not play - station ...) and the short running time . This movie was only ninety or so where as the first one and most of the Bond clocked in over two . Final score 8 .",1
"Many people have done it before , ruin a great book by making a film about it , but this is by far one of the worst book ever . I love the Harry Potter , every single one of them a sort of magic that  s very rare , a magic that both and like . The on the other hand , are a totally different story . The first movie was , well , , it  t bad , but it was no Lord of the . The second one was a bit worse , but still , fun to watch , but the third , my god what were they thinking when making this movie ? My thought is that they took the book , took some from it , the ending , the beginning , and some other small that affected the story line and a completely new book from there on , because almost everything been done differently . Now this could be a good thing , if the book  t the best Harry Potter book and virtually impossible to improve . So what gone wrong you wonder , well , nearly everything . It at scene one , where harry up his aunt , the book  t say she flew away and was never to be seen . And so it goes on , Harry  t spend in , now it  s only a day , we don  t see him , and going shopping in Alley , and Harry out about Black in a totally different way . And the trend goes on , most slightly , but some major big time . One thing that probably me the most , was the ending , it with a capital S . Harry get  s his new broom and off . What , but  t Black give that to him halfway his year , and  t he won the season with it . Yes , but apparently not in this movie , in this movie there is no , except for the first match . In this movie , Harry is just of the and that  s the reason he  s learning the charm . But why should he be , the  t at school grounds by Dumbledore , so he nothing to fear . I think they just to squeeze the broom into the movie , and by doing so , in ending . Now , if the story was all that went wrong , that would be one thing , but there are so many , bad acting , bad lighting , bad casting ( Emma never convinced me as ),  t bad , but good no . The only one who really convinced me was . I really saw him as Black . Of the three main , was the best , Emma  t bad either , , how in name he Potter will always remain a mystery to me . But this was his worst acting performance by far . And so what do we have after 2 of film . Well , I really don  t know , if you know the story line , the movie is entertaining , but nothing more than that , and if you don  t know the story line , you never will , because everything is rushed into . It  s a big book , and they fitted it in 2 , but that won  t work . Nobody if it  s a 3 hour movie , I  t care with like , and I  t care with Harry Potter , even better , I  d love a 3 hour movie , but make it a Potter movie . What the tried was to make a film both enjoyable for the Potter who had read the book at least once , and to the lesser as well , who had only seen the . And this movie is a disappointment to both . The real will see a of a brilliant book , and the movie will see a movie without a . I  m really sorry I have to rate a Potter movie like this , even more because the third book is still my favorite one . But that  s how it is , hopefully part 4 will be better , otherwise they might try to get Peter to direct the movie , because otherwise , I have little hope .",1

"For all its over - the - top vulgarity -- with large of pornography , scatology , and incest --  The  is fundamentally an intelligent and affectionate film . One gifted comedian after another into the time - muck of this joke , keen on the possible diamond from the sludge . The result is some of the most hilarious film - making of recent . It  s difficult to select just a few from this assemblage . Bob is surely the most startling ( and one of the ). Carlin both great humor and insight into joke telling .  s deadpan first - person account is unforgettable , and Gilbert  s post - 9 / 11 version is a jewel . Billy the Mime riotous sexual with various invisible family . Only a few misfire : perhaps most notably , a guy who to pull off a  clean  Jerry Lewis sort of physical comedy routine . And this is the paradox of the both the joke and the movie : clean just don  t work . The hilarity comes from the clash between the pornography and the , the comedic brilliance and the carefully . 90 on one joke may seem like , but the film skillfully monotony . The subject matter is the art of comedy : the  are fascinating and their enthusiasm is endearing . Two minor . First , it would have been helpful to identify each comedian * during * the film , not just during the ( excellent ) . Second -- and more seriously -- some of the camera - work was intrusive and , with rapid cutting that back and forth between full - face and profile . This got so bad at one point that I had to look away from the screen until the segment was over . 9 / 10 . A masterpiece of filthy good cheer .",1
"I saw this yesterday and I have to say I was . I  t actually read up on it beforehand but I kind of from a trailer I remember seeing on that it was about a creepy looking house and spooky . However when the film I quickly it  t just another horror film . In fact to be honest it  t all that scary but that  t make it a bad film . It  s possibly being to hard as a horror film and many of such as Massacre , Scream , will be disappointed for sure as it  s a slasher film . Apart from a flash back no one . Instead it me very much of like The Grudge , Ring and Dark Water in that it at a slow pace with a few here and there ( mainly by sound ). What this film apart though is that the is very clever and the story along nicely leaving you guessing for a few . The  twist  ending that everyone to be going on about never really like a twist ending , merely a revealing of the true however it  t something that was unexpected or totally that it  t fit . It to fit perfectly and not make the viewer feel as the were there all along for you to work . Overall I would recommend this film to people but let them know well in advance it  s not some slasher flick but merely a clever eerie story .",0

"Shy High might have been for little , but like most good ( and only the really good ) there are different of comedy . It was not necessarily the which made it great , but the who were saying them .

It was almost uncanny how accurate Sky High was to any other high school , just add super to the mix . All in all in was an extremely entertaining movie and the moment it was over my sister turned to me ( she is in college ) and said ,  As soon as this comes out on I am it ! It was hilariously fun , full of and it actually had a good moral lesson .

"Next time you complain about how cold winter is , think about how spent his summer . He and his crew went to Antarctica , the most brutally cold place on Earth , where they below - 80 * ( without the wind - chill ), to film the mating of Emperor . Every March ( fall in the southern hemisphere ), all of the Emperor leave their on the of the and march single - file to an area about 70 away . This is the breeding ground at which all of them were born . In some ways , they are like us . The stand around and strut their stuff while the choose their mate . Once the are decided , their are solely on procreation and keeping the egg alive . After the female the egg , however , she it to her mate -- the is unbelievable !-- and then 100 or more back to the shore to eat . The stay at the breeding ground to care for the egg . The then return to the breeding ground to feed their , and only then do the go to search for food . I was amazed at the sense of family . Everything they do is for the chick . Both quite literally risk their to keep their alive . What amazed me most is the sense of community among the Emperor . All of the go to the ocean as a single group , while all of the stay in one huge huddle , rotating so that each can spend some time in the warm middle , and some time shielding the group from the - 80 * cold and the 100 + wind . You don  t have to be a nature lover to enjoy  March of the . It is a story of love of family and the importance of community . The frozen desert of Antarctica beautifully on film . And Morgan Freeman is regal as narrator . Note : Despite the G rating , there is some material which may scare little .",1

Waiting from to ( I live in the and saw the sneak preview , officially it comes out in 3 days ), and finally I got to see it . I it . but I  t tell why ? It  s almost as impossible to tell how much I this film , as to explain what it  s about ( Well , it  s about a whale and and a man and construction and a king of the universe and a guide for what to do in certain ). But there are certain in the movie that make it so fun to watch . Sam  s crazy enough to play someone with the name and Martin Freeman is perfect as a neurotic man . The only thing I can say about this movie is don  t panic and hey , losing your planet  t the end of the world ;)",0
"So I ended up watching the movie just because & were in and I really ended up liking it , so when it came out I bought it . I rarely buy but this is a movie I can watch over and over again , its just THAT cute . Personally , I hate the . I think they are amazingly boring and are to detailed , just my opinion , but I cant really think of what drove me to see the movie other then my saying it was adorable , and they were right . I the movie very much in my home town theater with my , my  t like it , but everyone is to their own opinion . I think did a fantastic job as Count , I think he was perfect and extremely funny for the role of count . was absolutely perfect as , as was Browning for Violet . But even better , was law for the voice of Lemony Snicket . Overall , this was a great movie and recommend it ! Thank you for reading ,",1
"a perfect picture . I knew nothing before we went in , and read only afterward that she was a performance artist and thought  a ha , that how she such True Art on Film . The picture so clever and adorably funny on the surface , but its and beauty run to our core and . My husband and I all the way home at how many gorgeous there are to peel away and enjoy , flavor by flavor . My : The SYMMETRY : Of the , the first ( goldfish ) and last ( ) . From the desperate danger of the fire on  s hand , to the comfort of the fire of the rising sun in his son  s . The round circle of by their mother . The perfect ,  Like I  m a man in a book and you  re just meeting the man in the book . The : the full moon in  s full moon , the reflected circle him and then how he her repair the mirror , how he the reflected of self esteem on his ex - wife  s night shirt because only the wearer can read them in a mirror . The art curator fell in love with a reflection of herself , her own simply pasted back to her , framed by a child  s most basic understanding of sex ( poop ) and love ( back and forth , forever ). The F *** backwards on her windshield under the of passing . The distorted of the fish in the water bag ( is riding along a dangerous road himself ) as said  I don  t know you but I love you  which reflect her towards the special shoe salesman , after the empathy and insight he had shown into her undeserved ( foot ) pain . The looking , or not looking , in their at the fish on the . The : How touch and us ! The old man thought a shoe salesman touching his foot  was part of the service , but no  We never touch the foot . her three magic pink on her dashboard for strength , but she  squishy banana ( decal ) on his dash far too soon . The art curator and her assistant foolishly thinking a hamburger wrapper was sculpture because they did not dare touch it ! The child  s kind stroking of the art curator  s hair , and the gentle knowing kiss of the woman to the child . , the other shoe salesman / neighbor to them how wrong it is for him to touch the underage as he longs to , and the progress from bad to kissing each other instead . And , of course , the healing touch of  s pale perfect arm on the burnt hand of finally them both the peace . And their relaxation in embrace , peace to the viewer as well . The HOPE : The brushes with immorality that always veer back to the side of the pure . The other shoe salesman / neighbor , who could think and write about up with the underage , but when faced with their knock on the door , he was rightfully . The kindness of the older boy Peter , who was able to sense that the  friendship on him telling them they were both skilled the same ( when they  t ). And his to the mother - peep  s public about her Hope chest by her a private gift for it , and in her of loving a daughter . The boy who could have been hurt walking home but  t . The possible molestation that instead a tender moment on a park bench . That the curator woman with ( oh what that mug said about and their view of art !) had no family , and dog , and dog family , to sing with in summertime , but she away from that bench happy with the strange but beautiful connection she had made ... So happy that she could finally appreciate the strange but beautiful macaroni . And the RESPECT the film : for the young who are also sexual , in their way , for the single parent , for race , for the elderly , who still grow as much every day as the young : Yes , old was right , should collaborate , and it is her work with the old man that made it in the exhibition ...... to make it alone , but , like we all know , the ( or apartment building , or family ) are always more beautiful with a partner . Only after the solo artist was ready to truly accept and enjoy working with someone else , and only after  s protective were removed , did he call to begin their true love . Yes , the old man was right , even if the little girl saw her new goldfish die  At least we  re all in this together .",1
"As the saying goes : there  s no accounting for taste . So , I strongly disagree with the negative review featured on this movie  s page . One should note , however , that the reviewer ,  , high praise to several of the visual effects and the satirical  potent . I think the point when he the story which I found plausible and of more than ordinary interest , particularly for a disaster movie . Please be aware that my  10  rating is based on a comparison with other of this type ; it is not absolute . Furthermore , I think movie should be  conditional  rather than absolute .  t it unfair to compare , say ,  Something About Mary  with   s List ? Along these I would ask what other action / disaster does he consider superior to  Tomorrow ? As for myself , I found the effects chilling ( pun intended ), surprising , and awe inspiring . The scientific thesis underlying the story may be unlikely or even false as some have stated , but the vast majority of in the field do think that the earth is undergoing a warming period and that are to this phenomenon . So , the - end - of - the - world - as - we - know - it story this movie does reverberate in the popular mind . May I suggest that the plot may be a bit too plausible to be really by the popular mind ? Otherwise , I , for one , find it difficult to account for the overall lowish rating given in  s survey .",1
"While the special effects in the first part of the movie were well done , the plot and were some of the most ridiculous I have ever watched . I often thought that a 12 year - old had written the screenplay . Fortunately , I watched the movie for free on while on vacation in so I  t waste any money on this idiot - fest . It is a mystery to me how this poorly written ever get made in the first place . One of the I was to do when I retire is to take a screen writing class and mostly for the fun of it write an original screenplay and semi - seriously try and market it . After watching  The Day After Tomorrow , I feel very at the possibility that I might actually be successful !",0
"Typical comedy ... This movie does not bring any new comic or humor to the cinema . All are pretty much taken from previously made , hence making this movie very dull and predictable . There where a couple of moment in the movie that brought a smile on my face .. so I guess it was somewhat funny . If you like Pie , and the like , you will love this one , if not you will find it to be a waste of time and money . Rating 2 / 10 skip it !",1
"Let me begin by saying that I went to this movie with very low . I only went because my little brother to get out of the house . Now , I  m so glad I did . As a senior in high school , I to groan through a movie of the same as power . I was pleasantly ! There were of course some , such as the obvious villain and the villain  s look , but otherwise , it was cleverly written , had some original and as well as a very accurate view of high school ( I especially the cafeteria .) In short , go to this movie . It  s clever , fun , and not what you  d expect .",1
"I this movie . Call me old fashioned , but it had none of the charm and brilliance of Night of the Living Dead , Dawn of the Dead , or the . I don  t even think this was a horror movie . It was more like a bad action flick with cheesy . Sure , it may have had some amusing underlying socialist , but the and unite thing took itself too seriously . If Romero had made this movie when he still had talent , it might have been a good satirical zombie . Instead , I feel like he sold out to the same big budget crap he to be against . I  t it was bad , given that by the time he made the so - so Day of the Dead , he had totally given up on satire . Night of the Living Dead  t satire , but he should admit to himself that he can never make a movie as brilliant or as spooky as that . Romero lost it , but surprisingly , the remake ( of his original ) Dawn of the Dead was great . See that instead .",0
"Sky High that sort of murky area of a being a spoof and a straightforward story at the same time , a la Galaxy Quest . Though the genius of that film , Sky High nonetheless out similar territory . You  the pitch from the : Will ( , frighteningly a ) is the son of the two on the planet , The Commander ( ) and ( Kelly ). He  s headed for enrollment at Sky High , a special school which to the of super - powered people . The dilemma : Will no to speak of , so while everyone a great deal of him given his parentage , he nothing to show for it . Of course this being a film , Will a pining best friend , ( ) and a coterie of who stay loyal to him up until the point he becomes popular ( teen movie plot # 4 ). There  s also the  hot  girl , ( Mary ), who of course becomes involved with the son of the world  s . The first half of the film \u0096 well , no , most of it , really \u0096 is straight from Harry Potter . The are from a special lineage . They go to a special school for people with neat , driven there on a special bus . There are ; the hero is put upon by of him ; he must prove himself against a jerk out to get him . There  s even a hat , in the person of Coach Boomer ( ), who whether the new will be hero or . My favorite of the faculty was . Boy ( , perfectly cast ), the or  hero support  teacher . Sky High is fun despite its obvious borrowing ; in particular is enjoyable as the dad who never quite grew up , an amalgam of Superman and Batman and an eternal . less of an impression but a few good , mostly when sparring verbally with . is fine as Will ; he  s not charismatic enough to carry the film , but with all the eye - super - hero and an interesting enough supporting cast , he  s fine . The big surprise for me was a character Warren Peace ( Steven Strait ), a semi - bully who up surprising depth . There are some good in the film and it  s a fun diversion , pretty harmless , but not up to what I given that the who create Kim Possible \u0096 and Mark \u0096 were the primary on this . It  s cute throughout and clever in , but a tad predictable , and the similarity to Harry Potter up so often you almost wonder if J . K . will sue ( not that she needs the money ). I the movie , but you could easily wait for a rental on this one . Light fun , a bit of fluff , better than most of the fare out there at the moment , but nothing earth - shattering . I  d rather they go back to working on the far - superior Kim Possible , myself .",1
"I  d never about this film until watching it the other day and I have to say I was pleasantly . Sure , there is a bit of a Matrix feel about it in , a bit of Big Brother in other , and the premise that a society can suppress their was a little hard to swallow at first , but I really got into this film . Bale is good as the  seemingly  cold hearted cleric out to stop all  sense crime ... and I can see why he  s gone on to do Batman , he just right for it . The supporting cast really are that , they contribute to the story , but it  s Bale that the film is following and his journey is very well . It is always hard watching a movie when the initial idea or concept very strange and foreign , but Equilibrium to help you get over that by giving you a good story and you are interested in ( I to slap his son ). I know I said nothing in this to tell you what was going on , but I urge you to watch it and wait until the end when start .",1
"I have NOT read the on this picture . I probably won  t check on to this comment , cause frankly , I check mainly for movie . But I just HAD to say something that I can  t believe this movie is so bad . I just it ! The main are good enough , the story is rich and funny enough , but when on top of that you throw , the King of the ( and ) that  s just too freakily funny and lovable to ignore ! Always Ben Stiller and Rock . Always computer animation ( is top 5 of my comic ). The are also outstanding ( And bare in mind that I watched this on a pirate made in Russia ) ( sorry , if piracy ). The quality was not the best ... They even handled the flesh - eating friend - of - prey issue honestly , yet with lots of . Yeah , yeah , I know : They finish killing innocent fish , but taken the setup into account I find it a rather elegant way out of the paradox . But i just the , and proclaim myself a humble subject of King .",0
"Wow ! What is their to say about such a deeply layered and inspiring movie . The action is intense . The completely real . The movie is made in such a way that even though there is absolutely no way it could be real , you feel right into it . If I  m going to review this movie I  m going to have to start with the acting which in my opinion completely this movie great and will be the component that it together as a masterpiece far into the future . is the highlight of the film as ( A trustworthy who .) His acting is brilliant . He you care so much for the character that you are actually for him and against for a part of this film . When Sam to go home you feel right along with Sam . You want to share his . Next in the acting is  amazing portrayal of . I do not understand why people find this character annoying . To me he is the best ever put on film . Although his part is slightly smaller in this movie then the Two , the acting and achievement of are nothing short of awe - inspiring . Although Wood  s a supporting role to  s Sam he is still breath - takingly real in his performance of . You can literally feel the weight on his as he towards . I have only begun to name the tremendous in this film .  s will probably go down as one of the legendary film and that is not due to the of the character , but the subtle that come over  s face in the middle of intense conflict . There is a scene with and Billy  s right before a gate is going to come down because of the Dark Lord  s army . The writing in this scene and the exploring life after death are nothing if not perfect . Noble the very up to near perfection . All of the in my opinion were - worthy and the only reason they did not get nominated was that there were too many great to pick from . Among the best of the however is Otto  s portrait of , where she strength , grace , beauty , intelligence , and a desire for something more then she with awesome depth . Now I have finished talking about the acting which the film . Unlike most the effects are not the story but just a part of it . The effects are nothing if not extraordinary . The Battle of is the battle ever put to film . Peter obviously had a passion for the and it . What I  m trying to basically say is that the Lord of the the Return of the King deserved its 11 very much and it is in my opinion the film of all time .",1
"I used to travel on  s tube a lot . I always found it a comfortable place . Warm , mostly clean and a labyrinth of . To some it is a scary place , especially after the rush and the late night . The Underground system a lot of potential for a movie maker with imagination . Unfortunately this director none . Sure he , and his elicit grab is not to be blamed . For we all use our experience of gone bye . But shame . The victim woman had two to kill the  monster . and did not . I . And that is the worst condemnation you can give a horror film . All that money wasted . The opening with Ken and the black actor , who is unbelievable in all the he . He . He is never a person . The structure with regard to setting up later is thought through . The main actress does her job . In fact that is the word I  been looking for - job . This is just a job , with no insight , no imagination , and no love for the art . Horror at it  s level , the line would have a problem with this one . Refer to  Mind the gap ! Crap .",1
"The Upside of Anger some of the career of many , and . a woman with four whose husband left her . is  s next door neighbor who in love with her . the movie the relationship with them and the of the four , who are very well cast . The Upside of Anger is about learning to live again after in life . Director Mike Bender does a really good job of writing and this film . The film  s only flaw is Bender  s own character in the movie as  s producer on the radio . He comes across as someone who we can  t entirely love or hate . He is supposed to be a sleazy guy because he younger and one of  s , but since the character sincere in his for her , I  t get myself to completely hate him . He younger , so what ? The attitude the other have toward this character actually the balance of the movie , which is supposed to be about how anger is self destructive in the long term . Maybe the character was ill used or should have been cut from the film entirely . Otherwise , this movie is worth a rental and maybe better than some other that have been out recently . 7 / 10",1

"My friend rented this movie the other night and I had no about it what so ever . Eventually I found myself in front of the .  t even take the usual cigarette break , I just had to watch this one from start to end without any kind of interruption , that  s how intensive I think it was . The casting is carefully chosen , with Bale as a guy who really like a relic from the concentration of World war . I  m not usually a sensitive person about ugly and disgusting but Bale  s appearance really made me feel sick from the starting of the flick . This guy really how to sacrifice his body for artistic . The visual are pretty dark and hopeless and the misery of . can be sensed with a good mixture of devoted acting , matching and good camera work . Also I the film noir - type in the story . What more could go wrong in a life of an individual ? This is a f **** d up movie , I recommend you watch it in one piece to maintain the rare intensity .",1
"I  m going to skip the synopsis and get straight to the review - if you need the detailed background , look at the other or go to the  Requiem  home page . This movie is down amazing . If you  re shallow , you will watch and leave in disgust an hour or so into the movie . If you have the capacity for engrossing , deep , personal , disturbing , you will be glued to your seat in amazement . This movie is both physically and emotionally beautiful - the and camera - work is unbelievably executed . The great use of and a good drug drama to an awe - inspiring one . If you  re a fan of artful photography and your jaw will be ON THE FLOOR for the whole movie . The sheer style this movie is incredible , from the first moment the Summer Overture in to the very last , frantic , depressing second in which the film . The acting is top - notch . These might just be the of a lifetime for most of the / in Requiem . It  s hard to take your off of in the she is in - her emotion and sincerity is great . It better as she into drug addiction - her acting as a upper - is mind blowing . , , and all do an amazing job in the that they play - the desperation and sickness comes out brilliantly for all of these . One of the best , without a doubt , is when Harry ( ) ( ) about her addiction to  uppers  when he she  s grinding her teeth - you can clearly see that Harry is distraught . It  s perfect acting on both - many props to and for that . The climax is probably the best part of the movie . That is , of course , if you can handle it . It is the most harrowing climax to a movie I have ever seen . That  s actually an understatement . It  s disturbing , controversial , depressing , disgusting , revolting , and most of all just FRANTIC - and that  s what it so good . The whole thing will make your heart and mind want to burst until the last second when everything into a mass of hopelessness , and the end roll . It  s a moment you  never forget .",1
"is back , only this time , he  s not a bald white extreme sports star turned secret agent . He  s now a black ex - convict with only slightly more hair in the form of Ice Cube . But that  t stop Agent ( ) from recruiting him to stop the country  s Secretary of Defense ( ) from plotting a coup against the United government . The premise is a non issue here and there  s actually very little a plot . Sure , there some about protecting the president but there  s nothing too complex here . The script was written by and he usually on the action and not the story . For example , he also wrote the screenplay for . and . Smith and that film was heavy on action , low on story . The action are pretty nice and entertaining to watch . The action is the real reason to watch the movie since everything else is handled poorly . from the user , a lot of people took the film too seriously when really this sequel is a harmless movie . Obviously the story and action are highly unrealistic but so what ? This movie is clearly stupid and mindless yet still mildly entertaining . The acting is alright , at least the important can act . Ice Cube actually a pretty good performance as . He does a better job than Diesel and he a lot of charisma in the role as well . L . as and he also a good performance . a decent performance though he  t given very much screen time . The rest of the supporting  t as good . , and Sunny all give awful which  t too surprising but they don  t hurt the film . I actually like Lee as a director . He his simple yet still entertaining . Lee did a good job with this film and the action look terrific . However , this is probably his film yet . Despite the action , the film does get a little dull . I  t by this and there was really nothing they could have done since the film was 95 long . Before I saw this sequel , I was the worst . To my surprise , the movie turned out to be . Sure the is pretty lame and character development is non existent but the movie proved to be harmless and enjoyable . In the end , this sequel is worth a rental as long as your brain is turned off .

"First of all I want to say besides the fact that I am a big fan of bale I think this movie is great , wonderful story , and nice action , not to over the top ... the thing is this movie you can tell was not done on a high budget , but its wonderful this goes to show you don  t need blockbuster special effects to have a good movie . the are all very good in their . Its funny to me how bale done very good in the past and never made super - stardom , yet he does batman which is a blockbuster and all of a sudden people pay attention ... matrix had i mean come on look at his acting to and yet because he the special effects in matrix people took notice I  m done ranting ... thanks for listening",1

Everything in this film artificial , the , the , the and the authenticity of the film - premise . There was no moral proposition to the serious issue of Global warming . I that millions and the world was in total chaos and the whole film was centered around a bunch of ! I would not recommend this film .

For the first time ever , actually a reason to return home permanently ... but then he to find total peace with himself , first . A simple movie about simple with simple in their ... we don  t get to see many of these and even when there occasionally is an enthusiast director who  s to make a clever little movie like this , they  re straightly condemned to video - hell because nowadays movie - exclusively pay to see wild car and giant . Even though was one of the few young who DID receive some recognition and praising for his  Garden State , a large majority of film still  t discovered it . And they all should , since it  s heart - warming and identifiable tale , written and directed by someone who clearly and real cinema . It  s highly praiseworthy how an almost perfect balance between bittersweet melodrama and gallows humor !  Garden State  is a drama with a rather serious substance and yet it never becomes feeble or pitiful . On the contrary , the script  s subtle sense of humor and the beautiful hope and happiness ! Yes ,  Garden State  is a very good film and surely which way he  s going in the movie business . But still we  t acclaim him as a new and long - prodigy just yet ! Although very admirable , his film  t entirely flawless and definitely not . The story some truly brilliant ( ingenious \u0096 if only just two or three \u0096 is what really like this terrific ) and it  s a shame that too much of the  are blamed on . To focus more on the genius again : the is excellent ( a great - song and a downright track by and ) and the acting of an entirely talented cast simple  t be better . Portman is particularly impressive in the female character ever shot on film . already damn well how create moody and how to write solid ! If he  now just find a truly premise , his next project will be a masterpiece without peer ! * Note : This user comment is to the girl in the world ; .

I recommend the ( which several uncut and a good bit of background on the film ) This is such a cool story and a great message about anger get you to misjudge your life and your world .

I thought all of his and were perfectly . Everyone here said how great is but I am going to say that and Kerry were the two best in the movie ..( next to ) This is funny and warm and real and a great film .

I doubt that this joke been around for many . The groundwork for the joke was probably laid out maybe 4 - 5 ago . The fact that the groundwork was laid so many ago for the eventual joke payoff later is itself genius . The bottom line is that it does prove that  still have power . Thank you !",0
"This movie was a great and wholesome . A friend and I both went to see it ( both ) and every minute of it . It was funny and good life ( even for ). I the too ! The each had their own personality and their own sense of humor that I found quite interesting and clever . It me that a lot of thought went into it ( from the and ) and loving care when making this movie and which person would be the voice for each animal . The colors in the film were amazing !

I will definitely be out future shorts or . The are definitely onto something here , especially if they are trying to draw in 30 with of 80s anime .

"Zoom Suit was really fun and quirky . The are a lot of fun and the film  t seem to take itself too seriously . Animation style was great . The stereo - typical humor at the  expense was classic . Good use of character expression , color and I the background score ( think ). Story line for the short is pretty basic , but do you expect for 10 , right ? I would definitely recommend watching this to anyone who comic / animation fan ( especially if you or Aeon Flux ). Creator a real winner here . I hope to see more from this title . Maybe a series of shorts ?",1
"I saw Old Boy on a grey market about half a year ago and fell asleep during the first twenty . Since then , my have literally been begging me to see it to the end , so this I watched it on the big screen where I had no chance of escape . Boy was that a mistake . Old Boy is by turns idiotic , horrendous and senselessly violent . It the glee of the most basic revenge film . Even Kill Squad did it better . Old Boy simply no point to speak of . My question is : How did the director and screw up a revenge thriller ? Old Boy is very reminiscent of  s far superior the Killer . The difference between and Old Boy is one of . Both revolve around brutal revenge . In this film , the eponymous hero vengeance for fifteen of imprisonment in a hotel room . In , , a enforcer , must track down his Boss who may or may not be dead . Both and Old Boy use torture to achieve their , but in the violence is by such that it itself and becomes . Thusly , is far more violent than Old Boy , but far more aware . In Old Boy , the violence does nothing but communicate itself as alternately grotesque and depressing . The end of this film is so unbelievable that it made me wonder why they  t just let a seven year old rewrite it . It was that bad . If you thought the end of was head - scratching , wait until you see this one . You will feel so by Old Boy  s cop - out you may never want to see another South film again . I think the ridiculous praise this film received ( and included ) because NO ONE was comfortable . Additionally , was not distributed theatrically in ( Where I live ) and was for a period , even . is a more violent , more difficult film , but it  s are far greater than this piece of trash . How this film ended up at is beyond me . I think it was because of the reputation of Park  s much better  Sympathy for . Vengeance . Most likely , nothing I  m going to write here is going to prevent the curious from seeing this film . But if you feel like your time was wasted , don  t tell me I  t warn you .",0
"I really Zoom Suit , first of all I was by the and cinematography . It was very fluid and I actually  t it to be that good . Also the on humor and were cool like in the beginning with the drinking of the alcohol by the wife when they saw the . I also really the Zoom suit , it great and cannot wait to see what else it can do for the young man who found it . Another reason why I it it that it was a short story and the right length to capture my attention , I feel that that go this route will keep interested in what  s coming next more so because you can squeeze more in since they are so short . I also like the idea of some in the movie because they are always faced with social these days and to see how they handle conflict or change in their is something that me . This movie series very interesting and entertaining and I look forward to seeing more from these talented .",1
"*** May contain *** Quick Plot : In a world where super - powered , Will is the son the the super - hero couple , The Commander and . of superpowered are sent to an exclusive school Sky High in order to train them to use their super . The movie Will as he various while trying to live up to the of his famous . Basically this movie is a stereotypical  in high school  movie combined with a superhero plot . It all the standard of a teenage movie : male character , female friend who really him , group of that save the day , high school  tough guy , high school , night dance , attractive teenage girl that is desired by all the , However , the formula works with the superhero aspect added and combine to create a fun , entertaining movie . The special effects for the super really blend in well and the all do a great job ( both adult and alike ). The was good and the flow of the movie went well . A downside though , is that the movie was pretty predictable , at least for me anyway . I was already the identity and plan of the villain long before it was shown in the movie . But that  s just me . Overall , this was a thoroughly  fun  movie and good for all . This movie  t going to change your life , bring about world peace or be titled  Best Movie Ever , but it is a fun movie to watch and entertain . I definitely recommend this movie . I give it a 7 . 5 out of 10 .",1
"I recently saw this film and have to admit I was . I did not go in much , but as I enjoy the cinema I figured why not ? I am a fan of the four and it can  t be that bad if they accepted the . I have to say that what was very good , the acceptance of the making a lot more sense . It is refreshing to not have gore be what horror . I would the film more along the of a psychological thriller , like  Seven  ( though this film  t as brilliant as  s masterpiece , it does stay with you after the ). This film was one made which to respect the audience , which now  t done very often , especially in horror . Yes , the Southern / N  are rampant , but not used just because . The do actually effect the story . There is a reason they used that city as the film  s setting and the mythology of the city is almost another character . I myself am from the South in the and have been to New . I know how much the culture of and effects the of most to the city , even if they don  t believe . And the typical pretty girl sticking her nose where she  t horror stereotype comes in the form of  s character . What is different in this  horror  film is that the four can actually act . I found myself for  s character and for Hurt  s character .  s performance as the , non - believer , nurse is convincing and she  t treat the belief of her , like a silly superstition . She actually the belief while not it herself . Hurt  s performance being for me the highlight of the film , he is always brilliant and was so in this . so much without is always an acting challenge and one that Hurt met and with grace . Gena was fantastic in very role , which in character almost imperceptibly from sweet old Southern lady to evil oppressive wife to the surprise twist . Peter  s Southern estate lawyer was perfectly slimy and sexy at the same time . The mystery  s resolution , though , still was done quite well . The ending , when the  shock  twist comes and all is revealed was very refreshing . All in all the film used voodoo horror to its advantage and very effectively . If you want slasher and gore , go see  Devil  s , but if you want to be with some deal of respect and see a film which will have you still thinking about it when you leave the , go see  Skeleton Key .",0
"Very solid stuff . I saw it at the 2005 San Comic Con . Some comic book are featured such as Gene , whose been in the business since the 1970s ; whose have mold the comic industry in the last 20 plus ; and Bob , the man who made Iron Man one of the best of the 1980s . This  t your typical run - of - the - mill , pump - it - out - quick animation , . This is high art . If you are an animation fan , like I am , you will definitely appreciate the work and care that gone into this obvious labor of love . The story is original , the unique . I am glad I was able to see this little gem , as I may not have seen it , had I not gone with a friend to the screening at the San Comic Con . Seek this one out , , you will not be disappointed .",1
"s  Zoom Suit  is a very interesting new project . It a deceptively simple premise , that more intriguing with each passing minute . I the animation a lot . At first it somewhat simplistic , but as , it to take on additional texture and , in so doing , reflected a welcome level of spirit and soul . The color scheme is very primary , but that works well for this adventure . The story is classic material for a  s ( both big and little ). At first I was wondering which way it was headed , but I was soon engrossed . It really on you ! The basic plot around a  little guy , by his , who a chance to be a warrior when he the Zoom Suit . Who can  t identify with that ? It will be interesting to see this project develop . I look forward to more of .  s intriguing work . As it is now , it  s definitely worth a look ! !!!!",1

"One of the worst I  had the displeasure to sit ; hard to believe this was directed by the same man who made Drugstore Cowboy , My Own Private & To Die For . A film only by pseudo intellectual pretentious . If one to see a good art - house film that the of drug abuse ( which Van Sant  s film only obliquely & ineptly upon ) try Requiem for a Dream , which is a film of great merit ; contrast that with Van Sant  s film , which is totally pointless , with you don  t give a damn about . The discerning film buff is a tough time this year ; either we  re with crap from the ( Fantastic Four ), or art - house garbage such as Van Sant  s film . Try catching  Head - On  &  Downfall , two German language that are among the year  s best . They stand out like in a manure pile against most of the current U . S . ; is it any wonder with the cinematic crap that we  re spoon fed that domestic BO is in such a slump ?",0
"I have to admit that I more after read some . There are a few good and I a few of the but I  t with the film . I have to add though that I saw the German version and so with the original it might have been a totally different experience . For my taste there was too much talking and much of it was fairly repetitive . Much of it is also quite ( superficially ) on the US and the rest of the world may be getting fed up with this after a while . I  t find the zebra  s cheer - leading act in the background too funny . I wished more would have gone into the story .",1
"It really is sad when an eleven year old child is a better actor or actress in a film than anyone else in it , especially when is part of that very small list . However , Hide & Seek is one of those . It is difficult to believe that an actress that young ( probably ten when this movie was made ) can act with such superiority , but unless the film was a reality movie ( which don  t worry , I don  t really wonder whether it is or not ), that is the case . A young girl ( Fanning ) her mother to a suicide incident and is never the same again . She her mother with passion , and all of the happiness and life she once had is drained from her . She therefore an imaginary friend , which is all well and good , up until heinous against her father ( ). The movie is very fast paced and it to a nearly fatal ending that you will never forget . The twist is not predictable , and you will never be able to pick up on it during the movie , unless you  re very observant ( there are some subtle throughout the movie ). The ending is what this movie . I love that kick me in the at the end , and I have seen a countless number of like that ( The , Secret Window , and Vanilla Sky as some ), and I have yet to be able to see it coming beforehand . 8 / 10 !",1
"When I saw House of 1000 for the first time , shortly after it  s release , I  t all that . Rob Zombie  s homage to exploitation out much like a backing video for him to play his against , and that ; combined with the style that I  t enjoy myself all that much . I  seen more exploitation since then , however , and have become much more tolerant of fast ; and so upon my second , I found that this is actually a very good horror film . For a rock singer , Rob Zombie a surprising amount of directorial talent ; and it  s always obvious that he the that lead to this one being made . The plot is typical exploitation , and it a group of that find themselves at the mercy of a Massacre - style family  s sadistic sickness . What is a tour de force of sickness , gore and violence that any notion of plot or with just simple visual potency . This  t the sort of film that will top  best of all time  ; but if you  re in the mood , Rob Zombie  s ride won  t disappoint . Zombie given us a number of sick to shock and entertain . We  got the sick clown , name of Captain ; the beautiful , yet sick ,  Baby ; her equally odd mother , hideously burned Tiny , hideously sick  , and best of all ; a deformed  doctor , delighting in the name of Satan ! If you know Zombie  s music , nothing in this film will really surprise you . Rob old style heavy rock music , with a nu - metal swing to it ; and House of 1000 is an old - school horror flick , with new added . Zombie to enjoy himself by sepia of his into the mayhem , along with various other . Zombie direction  t all about throwing in nice , however ; he does have some talent , and this is shown best in the brilliant scene that shoot a policeman ! There to have been something of a resurrection for good horror since the millennium ; and while we  re still not back in the golden age that this film is a tribute to ; this decade been a hell of a lot better than the - and this film is one of the why .",0
"When I first saw on the for I thought  action adventure bang bang boom flick , interesting but not enough so to pay $ 10 . Last week I discovered that it was the film adaptation of one of my Clive ! I just * HAD * to see it on the big screen . The only place it was in was at a dollar in San , so off I go , 5 & 300 round trip . $ 1 . 50 a ticket . I read the reviewer who pointed out it was - , with set each building on the other & bigger than the last . Perhaps this is one of the small I found uncomfortable about the film . Being a fan of the , I feel . to use a steady undercurrent of tension , like an undertow at the beach , with an ending like a . I can only imagine the . had to make to keep in hand & maintain a decent semblance of his story . : Dirk is well cast & by . The basic plot is intact . The action is pretty good ( still on the big bang boom tho ). for a good . . THE CAR IS IN IT ! The climax is pure / . Surprisingly , the of 70  s Rock works well . A bit startling at first , it took a bit of over & the decision finally came to rest on the positive side . : Several minor were for no beneficial reason ; Dirk & Al are now former instead of Air Force .  s beard is a full - face feature rather than a Van Dyke . is no longer a former SeAL , & is a chunky comic relief character . Borderline ( aka that are different but turned out alright none the less ) Al  t a stocky swarthy powerhouse . Well by , he  s got just the right touch of sarcasm & mischief . I really thought he was closer to getting his character right than , who was quite agreeable still the same . is a private much like it  s real life counterpart , which actually up the tidy denouement . ** SPOILER WARNING ** I  said in other that the attention span & bladder capacity of the average viewer are too limited to do faithful of to . A few notable are , North & South , The Stand & Lonesome Dove . Budgetary also preclude a cast of & big battle . , the abduction of President is not included in the script . Hala never an appearance . Without the Secretary General of the UN , & without as the head of a US governmental agency to call in & pull , there  s no timely intervention by the UN quick reaction force , therefore no heroic stand at the Foreign Legion fort . In their place , the local make a timely appearance to save our collective bacon . There is a terrific last stand by Dirk , Al & at the tho , which to a great alternate ending which could just as easily have been in the novel ! I take exception to the presentation of light machine gun piercing being capable of penetrating the ironclad  s , but this is fiction after all . Sadly , Prospector Clive & Periwinkle the burro , St . & never make . Conclusion : After a disagreeable experience 25 ago with  Raise the Titanic ! Clive permitted to take another crack at his marvelous creation . This is an acceptable first outing & hopefully the learned will be taken seriously & the mild rectified . I don  t know what other might be in the works , but I read that there were 3 ( take that for what it  s worth ). Personally , I  d love to see  Vixen 03  &  Night Probe ! as , but those are my personal & can  t go wrong with any of the Dirk . Which is not to say can  t MAKE it wrong . Very , very wrong . I still scratch my head trying to figure out how  Raise the Titanic ! turned out so modestly mildly mediocre . With such a great story , with such a capable cast , ( albeit occasionally - cast ) it should have been much better . that demon , but  t blow it away . I recommend this as a rental for everybody , a purchase for , & I eagerly await the next installment . But I  still see it at the dollar .",1
"This movie some great about it . In its story of four adopted sons of a passionate ( lost  by no one in the world but her ; she  s as true a saint as any of  s or Trier  s ) home for their mother  s funeral after she is as a witness to a petty robbery , it is nearly in its tragic scale . But when these in everything but blood lose sight of everything their mother stood for and the movie into a ( and egregiously ) revenge caper , all of that early power is . The mother  s  ghost  to each of them in turn ( more ), but only -- get this -- to warmly remind them of their table manners . Singleton this audacious device when it could do the most good : where is she when her sons are everything she ever taught them , and in cold blood the men they believe to have her ? This tragedy of character is not acknowledged by anyone , least of all the director Singleton ; instead it is celebrated . After the adrenaline ride Four took me on -- the nighttime / in an urban blizzard is absolutely stunning -- the movie ended leaving me feeling sad . Sad for the , and sad for the mother . The sacrifice of one of the , and of any character and honor the mother  s love might have these build , for a murderous campaign carried out in her name , is the true -- but -- tragedy of this story . It could have been a much movie if Singleton had continued to use the mother  s  ghost  as a device to show that the were at least aware that what they were doing was out of anger and revenge , and would have been against her . There was none of that kind of . What could have been grand tragedy in the tradition of Ford , becomes instead a hollow fantasy . No ; THAT  S the real tragedy .",0
"To quote the critically turned author O  ,  A true story that never . Or at least that  s what Over There to be to be .

While the dialogue familiar  war movie  group , the visual presentation is excellent . The show does an excellent job in the dirt , , heat , and freezing nights of the desert . The most effective are the with the dialogue and everything is shown . Whatever your on the war , the show is worth out if only for the fact the public to think about the war again ( which to have been to the back of the collective consciousness ).

"The answer to that question would be , or basically anyone to do with this movie . It a couple of funny , but overall it  s very , very generic . Even Mac  t funny in this movie , which I  t think was even possible . It  s pretty much like this - you know how on his show he  s basically doing a watered down version of what he he does in his ? Well , this was like the third filtration from the and basically a watered down version of what he does on the show . I don  t even know why this movie was - 13 . It was a solid as far as I could tell . You could edit out the word  sh * t  maybe a couple of times and show it uncut on network television . I hate it when forget to be funny .

"Zoom suit is a new film about a young boy who a magic space suit . It is an animated film with vibrant . The film the alienation of a young boy in a simple but effective way . With his new suit he can fit in with the rest of the around him but it is not that easy . The opening sequence great potential and the music the film well . The is easy to follow and should appeal to the age group it on the screen . If handled properly it could be very good but it must be careful not to become just another copycat feature . It will be interesting to see where the film take us with this . It may not appeal to older but as the slogan , If the suit , wear it . Good luck to the of the film and i will watch out for the finished product .",1

"can you tell me what you of this movie ? before you call me an ignorant moron because i this movie , let me say that i really admired van sant doing something different than the other rubbish that have been made recently . but i really really did not like this movie . i know that there was supposed to be no story line and the whole movie was supposed to be watched as a  fly in the wall  perspective , but there was just nothing that made me keep wanting to watch and see what was going to happen . i found many of the quite amusing like when blake was making macaroni and cheese . but overall during the movie , i just  t get into the movie or really care about anything that was going on and only to feel more at that dragged on for way more than they were to . so if someone can tell me what was so great about this film , maybe i might reconsider my and give this movie another shot . thanks a lot .",0
"I  m a big fan of horror so I was keen to go along to see this . However I was extremely disappointed . It that once again they took all the   and them together for the trailer . Yet again I was in by the . The cast were good , and the idea itself was good , but I came away from the movie thinking that they could have done so much more with it . If anyone was thinking of going along to see this , I would say keep your money in your pocket . What a waste of the talent when you have an actor like Hurt and fail to use him to his potential . Yes he was good , but it could have been so much more . And as for making you jump ? Where were the ? Precious little as far as I can see .",1

"I guess there is no - one who can say that he or she  t know what during the genocide in 1994 in . The of all the , often with nothing more than , were absolutely . But on us this event perhaps had an even bigger impact than on other and on . Not only , after  s defeat in World War I , long been a protectorate ( no , just as it never been a colony . We only had one and that was ), making that we still have some kind of historical connection to the country . Our government always the with military assistance and training ( except during the genocide ). But we were also personally affected by the genocide when 10 of our UN peace - were brutally in a military camp because they tried to protect one of the . Three of them were shot , the were hacked open with . The of the who cut their blue into with their , once their returned home , will never be forgotten by all those who saw it back then . Hotel   t show anything about that particular event , but it does give a good idea of what the rest of the entire genocide , and the reaction of the international community towards it , was like . This movie everything from the perspective of , an ordinary hotel - manager from origin who saved the of many  s . While the rest of the  s brutally every around him , he not only his wife and his , but many of her and to escape the horror by opening the hotel for them . Despite the fact that he  t get much help from the UN or from the , he was able to save over a thousand helpless ... I would like to say that this is a wonderful movie , but not without that I  m not talking about all the . What I like so much about this movie is that it how a seemingly ordinary and unarmed man was able to stand up against all those militia men , not only protecting the of thousand people , who would otherwise have faced a certain death , but his own life by doing so and  t care . If this  t been based on a true story , many would have said that it was impossible , but it  t . All this actually , the good as well as the bad . The of this movie have it all very well and certainly have done some great research about the and the attitude of the international community . The acting in this movie was also outstanding . Don did a perfect job in his portrayal of and Nick was excellent in his role as the Colonel , but that  t mean that the other , less known ,  t at least as good as them . They all did a wonderful job , lifting this movie far above average . If there is one thing that I could have a remark about , than it must be the fact that they speak , instead of . But that  s such a little detail , that I  m very willing to forget about it . It  t really bother me and it certainly  t spoil the rest of the movie for me . Overall this is a movie that should be seen by all . Not only because we should never forget what over there in 1994 , but also because we should hope this is a lesson for those who are on doing it and for those who never did anything about it . I give this movie a well - deserved 8 . 5 / 10 .",1
"Like the great Don who broke away from to start his own creative , is no doubt quickly becoming one of the great new to come out of the comic and trading card .

Funny , smart , visually interesting and just plain good . We were all laughing , as were the other around us . The were very witty and capable . The script was great . The set and special effects was first rate . I usually enjoy going to the girly ( Princess , .) but I into this film with a bit of a bad attitude , convinced the superhero plot  t cut it .

However , I think his role of  Crash  from Bull . There are far too many going on to make you believe as I did that it just might be him . The jacket , the talk , the way he to be then what we are to think , his baseball background and all the drinking .

"I  d like to keep this review relatively short so here goes . was easily the best film of 2003 and one of my of all time . The story which is a twisted tale of violent revenge is fantastic , and the final twist in the story is a deeply disturbing and shocking one which the viewer a fantastic confused sense of what to feel for the . The direction is sublime as is the score , it perfectly with the tone and the visual style of the movie . The acting is also great , you know its a sign of a good actor when he eats a live squid , even though his were quite strict .

"It  s difficult to make this film and not disappoint someone . The are just too high ; after three , grown men are still wearing silly and making odd while waving their plastic light outside .

Furthermore , if he to make some more money and have his sell stuff on , more power to him ; if you don  t like it , buy another brand . I could care less whether up advertising for . My lie elsewhere . Somewhere along the way , the novelty wore off . Effects that should be better are now simply and . The puppet from the 1980s better than the of today . between main went from to painfully corny -- never more . Beyond the poor effects that almost universally look fake , and the that at times on ridiculous , the real downfall in my opinion is that I  t convinced had compelling to turn to the dark side . Since this is the whole point , my opinion of the movie . Another problem I had was that chose to side - step plot by either covering them in the cartoon  Clone  or them from the story entirely . Again , it  s his call , he made it ; however , I don  t have to like it ... On the bright side , it  s a fun film with plenty of action and lots of blow up . I suspect lots of people that have for three might be wondering if it was wise to attend and dress up like space after all ...",1

It  s a solid movie because of the life of itself . The story of is not his mental illness , nor his affair with , nor his run - in with Congress . Rather the story of is about what did , what he built , what he accomplished , what an incredibly great and gifted man he was .

No matter how hard this movie to portray . as some kind of , and no matter how unbelievable and superficial is .

Well because there is not enough on . I don  t know why people  t like this wonderful masterpiece . Maybe because you don  t like love and who ever  t  t of watch this one then and go do bad on it . And maybe people  t like it because it is a remake , well get over it , I like this one way more then the 1953 version and plus I like all the because if watch Walking tall well I have the choice between the good one or the bad don  t know why people  t like the story . I think the story is great there could  of been a better one that the gigantic boat ( titanic ) sink in the middle of the Atlantic . Every thing is wonderful about this movie , the , the , the music , the visual effects , the scenery , and every thing else . should  gotten en award for his great performance and should  gotten one too .",1
"Overall this film like poor theater with cool effects . I don  t get the feeling that the believe what they are doing . I found that was the best actor , the only problem is that he  t really an actor , he  s computer animated ! That some about how far computer animation come , but sadly also that the real  t good . Only as Supreme Chancellor can walk away without shame . If you like me don  t really think that that say   then you might want to stay away from this movie , because like that are plentiful . Perhaps this is an intentional trick not to make the film too dark ? I would have hoped that after Yar Yar would have that people it .",1
". A name most infamous and by many . A man who is considered the epitome of evil and hate . The  Downfall  of , and what actually took place in the bunker those last days , even though it may have been show in History , never been in such detail . Downfall was a terrific film . The precision of the , most notably by was so true to the reality that was World War 2 . It is a true eye opener to what it may have been like . The story is told from the perspective of , a young secretary for who herself in a situation that she was never get out of . Trapped in the world of propaganda , and working for the man who was key to mass murder of 6 million . The cinematography and use of camera was amazing . Moving and to adjust mood and space . from a figure of power , to a pitiful man who is mad with jealously , anger and hate for anyone and everyone . The acting was bar none . It was like history was out for you . is an amazing actor . I can  t imagine how difficult it would be to portray such a man to the perfection . was a particularly interesting character . Her manner and inability to find the appropriateness in any situation was unsettling . I will hand to to the cast and crew of Downfall , you sent down my spine . The brutish , cruel and rather sad life od , and the blinded dedication he was shown by his Nationalist - Socialist was so disturbing . If there is one criticism of the film , it would have to be the realism of it all . It was too real ! This really  t a criticism at all . It only my point that this film was of the highest quality . The and harsh manner of the German was amazing . of despair and utter loss , yet the ability to get up and move on for the  sake  of National - Socialism . The idea was terrifying that people could be such blind . To be into entirely and be with the idea of murder , racism and anger . Downfall is not to be . If you do not wish to delve into intellectual discussion and would rather a film like  Bring it On Again , then perhaps this is not for you . This movie is for . I  t call it enjoyable , but it certainly is . It is a great movie .",1
"I actually saw this movie by accident ... Well , half of the movie I saw because one of my  s to sneak into . Before we got caught we saw a long part of the movie and I ( surprisingly ) it . After that , I saw it on sale at BlockBuster and bought it ... Since then I  watched like a million times already ! Me and my never get tired of wearing Napoleon and the good in the movie ! Napoleon Dynamite probably the worst life ever ... A grandma who to go ride sand instead of knitting , a brother who to chat with  , and a Uncle who could care less about Napoleon or how many times he beat up at school . Then he the new Pedro and a shy girl Deb who ( in their first scene together ) leaves all this crap  on his porch . This movie basically all of the of school : Class , Popular , , , , and who always seem to pick on the weird like everybody else . I this movie because the spoke with absolutely no expression at all ! And I think it was meant to be that way . THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME AND YOU MUST SEE IT !! We  re talking about a movie that  s still a good movie without , sex , and anything else vulgar ! Plus , it  s rated ! AWESOME MOVIE ! P . S .: I wish all you other people out there would STOP on Napoleon Dynamite with your MEAN and quite RUDE ! If you don  t have anything nice to say about this movie then just keep it to yourself ! Your are people away from a nice movie ! Write to FOX / Paramount or complain about it on the message just stop it for the rest of us who actually LIKE this movie !!",1
"Obviously , you   don  t learn geography in school . This is shown clearly in this movie . I  m not going to review all the geographical , language and political made in this movie . But I want to say that is maybe the most peaceful country in the world .

"I never thought I  d say this about myself , but I  m thinking of something Bill said in an opening monologue for  :  If you in line for 6 dressed as Luke , you came to the wrong show . And you  re a loser . I  m so torn . One problem might have been that the sound in the theater where I saw this was not very good ; there were times when I  t have been sure what the were saying , except that I already knew the from the book ; quite a few other me . I can see the / made a valiant effort to morph the into the Blockbuster Feature Film Format . I  m sincere here ; I really do think it was valiant , and my hat  s off to them . But I have to put that aside and ask if it worked . And it  s hard to say . Some of the new were surprisingly resonant for me ; the requisite ( feature film ) love interest actually worked ; and I particularly the way they dovetailed that in to the such as the new Earth from , and /  s resolve to give that up -- in a way , giving up the promise of a new , the opportunity to get the  di cho  ( Earth  in ; literally ,  dirt ball ) rolling again , in exchange for the need for adventure , to  go somewhere . How amazingly , if not outright , conciliatory of the behind this to treat old to the spectacle of the two chief as ( of all ) a * sight gag *. Who  d o  ? But can the movie have universal appeal ? I  m afraid it may not . The true test is in how it will be received by those who haven  t read the . But then , I have a feeling that no one who digs - fi * not * read the , or at least that first book . So I may be concerned about the response of a non - existent demographic ; people who haven  t read the , who would nonetheless take in a movie like this . This I know ; the response here in been poor . There  s an interesting challenge , as - fi is not a big genre here . I  m fully aware that the foregoing is all . But I have mixed . In so many ways , I should be thankful that this thing finally came to fruition . But I still basically feel that the book is ( sigh ) better . Well , of course it is ; it ( almost ) always is . But this is one of those rare where I feel to make special note of the fact , unfortunately . . If you  re a fan , see the movie and report back . In triplicate .",1
"One of the I  seen in a long time . If you  re not familiar with the joke , that  s fine . If you are , you  probably enjoy this movie on an entirely different level ( which may or may not be better ). Whatever the case may be , be prepared to laugh to the point of crying and in some , sides aching . Now , be ... this movie is not rated , and is about the most disgusting joke ever told . If you  re a prude , you  probably walk out like the stuck up couple who left the theater about 10 into the screening I was at tonight . There are some howling , there are some painfully unfunny , but overall , I can  t recall laughing this much in a theater since seeing There  s Something About Mary . This is an exercise in 1st Amendment ( this movie would have been shut down in the days of ). If you think 97 of various doing their of the same joke won  t work , you  re in for a surprise . This movie so much more than that ... It a real affection for comedy and comic . I have to see it again , there were so many I , either because of other people laughing or because I was laughing to hard to hear . If you love stand - up comedy ( or just enjoy laughing ) and  t easily offended , you must see this movie . You  laugh your ass off .",1
"Just saw the flick tonight at in . Director came out and did some Q & A with the audience afterward . Apparently he  s been this thing together for five . , it certainly was worth it . Probably the most entertainment and fun you  ever get from any documentary , ever . Period . I  often times people talking about the  magic  of comedy . It  t be or ; either you  get it  or you  don  t get it . Along these same , comedy cannot be taught . Either you are born funny , or you  re not . In my opinion , that is a load , sir . This film to explain quite a lot about the practice of comedy ( by showing , not telling ), all the while being very , very entertaining , and very , very filthy . No sex or violence in the film : just people talking . But what glorious filth they talk . Simple idea for a documentary : of tell one of the , of all time . The thing that the joke both a lousy joke and a template for great comedy is that its middle section is completely open to interpretation by the teller . The only mandatory are the opening sentence and the . It  s a like a comedic test ; a tabula rasa upon which each comedian his own particular comic style ; be it aggressive , sarcastic , dry , cynical , , , , offended , angry , apologetic , or totally unconnected with reality ( and Steven Wright ). The is excellent , with of various  coming together to bring forth several throughout the film . This film is comfortably in the great tradition of rampant ribaldry and scatology first by Benjamin Franklin , in his classic essay ,  Proudly . ( That  s not a joke . Franklin really did write such an essay .) So if you want to get some insight into the craft of comedy , or you just want some down - and - dirty entertainment , this is one of the best ways to spend some time in the company of sharp comic away . At more than one point the movie the comparison between and jazz , and this sense : jazz and stand - up comedy are two of the most lasting of entertainment given to the world by culture . This is a very entertaining movie . What do I call such a movie ? The !",1
"Read ,  Ghost , before you watch the movie . It  s the best book I  ever read . If you can read it without crying , then you don  t have a soul . If the movie was done right , it will have the same effect . Some have that the movie too much drama and not enough action . But you can  t really set up the story without seeing the background . The book it all . The Death March , the imprisonment , people dying every day of malnutrition and disease . When you finally get to the end and the attack place , all that drama will lead into , if the movie was done correctly , one of the most climactic in the history of cinematography . Period . Action are a dime a dozen . These POW  s for for even the glimmer of hope . What little hope they did receive , in the form of Red Cross care , were by the before making their way to the POW  s . Their world was bleak and hopeless . How can we expect to understand the frustration and gradual loss of hope they felt if we don  t have ample time to understand their suffering ? If this movie the anguish , despair , and finally the redemption as well as the book does , it will absolutely be nominated for every award they can come up with . But that  s a big ,  if . The movie the potential to redefine the word ,  hero , not only in the way we associate the word with , but in the way we apply it to real life . That just cannot be accomplished in the average 90 minute action film . If you want nonstop action , watch Predator ( which I do really like , by the way .) If the movie is going to give us any appreciation at all for the horror these POW  s , if it  s intent is to give us even the idea how important this raid was to the POW  s and their , then without question it needs to be long and full of drama . The ending will take care of itself .",0
"I haven  t this hard at a movie in a long time . I got to go to an advance screening , and was because I had been dying to see it . I had in my from laughter throughout a lot of the movie . The audience all my laughter , and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie . Kudos to ( who I had already been a fan of ). He in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy . He a style that I haven  t seen before . And Keener is excellent as always . Thank God there  t a cameo from Will ( love him , but saw him too much this summer ). There were of comedic genius in this movie . Partly thanks to , and partly thanks to the writing ( also ). The waxing scene and the speed dater with the  obvious problem  were absolutely hysterical . I will definitely go see  40 Year Old Virgin  when it  s . My advice : go to see it for huge and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it .",1

And during where his mature are meant to contrast the otherwise silliness of the moment you can tell that he a future as the next great film star .

"It an interesting concept and atmosphere , but I think they could used it a lot better . It  s more a psychological thriller than terror , and it  t use too much those  high from the music  to scare people , which I think this it  s better than the rest . does an job , and the rest of the cast too . The beginning of the final act , with the first  surprise , a bit weird and stupid , but the final twist to the movie another point of view . I it , I think it worked , but I would prefer another kind of result for the movie instead of this one . If you accept the of the movie , and the of the end , it will work , but it  s not the final story I  d wish .

We are then straight into a car chase box  s of getting hit , how  s that for a ? then a fight , with of - mo camera work , resulting in the death of the bad guy which to go un - in the market place ! Slater is unfortunate to be the star of this turkey with Tara - staring as his who is an archaeologist , you can tell she  s clever as she glasses and her hair in a bob , though she does spend most of the movie running around in a naval revealing tank top . She was obviously hired for her and not her acting ability as she plainly none , I can  t recall such a wooden performance for some time ! The movie on at a snails pace , we get a pointless and utterly gratuitous love scene , then some monster  s appear and a SWAT style team , lead by the dreadful , spend the rest of the movie trying to kill them and the movie turns into a dreadful low grade style flick - but without the horror and suspense !

"The modern horror film and originality , two that go together like and  essential night . Well  House Of Wax  is yet another remake , though I use the word  remake  very liberally , this more in common with  The Massacre  than the 1953 Vincent Price flick of the same name . A group of obnoxious US who listen to rap and metal , smoke dope and drink beer , have a run in with some mad . The men are all tough and , the woman , obviously , are attractive and wear small tops . Indeed the film - are so desperate in this movie that they cast that waste of a sperm / egg liaison , coming soon to your local multiplex no doubt ! The movie of at a snails pace ..... and then , indeed in a 100 minute movie it  s not until the 50 minute mark that we get the first on - screen murder . do then pick up a bit , but not much . We get a nice decapitation and get  s a wooden stake through her head , though surely it would have still her brain by a good 6 !!

"Berlin 1945 : The Red Army it  s last great offensive of the Second World War with a massive armored and infantry assault on the German capital . Deep inside a bunker underneath the German is the German , , and his general staff the last desperate defense of the city but time is quickly running out with even the most fanatical and optimistic of them , with the exception of , know that the end is near and are looking to somehow escape from this hell on earth or at least negotiate a surrender with the . It  s these historic days during the spring of 1945 that are covered in the movie  Downfall . Explosive and blood - film with an Award caliber performance by as the German leader as his nation is being with daily and nightly one thousand plane from the air and with millions of allied , on two , swarming across it  s on land an end to the Third that he brought into power in back in 1933 . The total pandemonium that struck that city is realistically and graphically in the movie that  s based on the of  s personal secretary , Maria , who was working for him in that capacity since 1942 . One of the best about ever made him shown in a very different light then the usual that were used to seeing him in the of made about , and , over the . Wild threatening and hysterical towards his when  t going right , which in the movie was almost all the time , his  human side  when it came to his personal staff . that they leave the city before it fell to the Red Army and also being grateful to them when they refuse and to stay , and kill themselves , along with him when the end came . There  s a great scene in the bunker when that the  great offensive  that he by German General  s 9th Army , to smash the and throw them out of Berlin , never because he , ,  t have the men and to do the job . Completely losing it and his have it at last finally , with the later defection of his two top leader & second in command , that the war was lost . then instead of trying to escape from the city decided to stay at his post , as the German Chief of State , until it  s defense was no longer possible then end it all by a bullet in his head . Terrifying with blood and and body flying in all with even the themselves , the Army and , shooting of German and who were trying to flee the city , to save their , for and not standing and fighting to the last man and woman like their ordered them to . With all the in the  Downfall  the one that struck me most , even though it was very minor to the rest of the carnage in the film , was the murder by the of Propaganda and his wife , & , of their six young by poisoning them as they were asleep . Determined to both kill themselves the   t even want their to survive the war saying that there  s no reason for them to live in a world without National Socialism or their  beloved  or uncle as he was efficiently by them . the movie  Downfall  more then anything else how right the Union Civil War General was in his famous statement  War is Hell .",1
"Well I  read the book when I was a , really the series back in the  80s so my were high for the movie .... and I  t to be disappointed . The cast is pretty much as good as you could hope for , Martin Freeman ( Dent ) ( Trillion ) ( Ford Prefect ) Sam ( ) are all excellent , Fry was born to be the narrator , but the the star of the show was , the depressed , well near suicidal Robot . Voiced brilliantly by Alan , he every scene he  s in , it  s a pity he  t get more screen time really . The are sometimes cheap and cheerful , quite superb , the of the factory floor are .

"... at this fellow , and is totally for suing this production . It is just a collection of nice . Really , nothing more . Not even the attempt to produce a coherent plot .

It is not their fault . They are the only reason this movie  t go towards - 1 . Some are watchable . But put it together ( aka view it as a MOVIE ) it just my mind how anyone can let this slip past basic . I  said some about  and Smith , but in the end that movie was watchable . This one just a few of my teeth . I won  t give any (... ahum ...), but was more believable ... Really , I have nothing against the imagination of what is possible .

"This review information that may be a spoiler by some people . Basically , I tell you what horrible plot device I  m happy they  t use . Overall I thought the movie was really good . The Machinist kept me wanting to know what next , up to the end . The end which  t entirely terrible me of a  Kill Bill Vol . 2  ending . At the end of  Kill Bill Vol 2  I an awesome fight scene but on first was disappointed with the way handled it . Subsequent have made me appreciate the way threw a sucker punch in there that you  t expect . In  The Machinist  the build - up is so twisted that you expect the ending to be something you  t possibly have . { b } I {/ b } the ending to be so far out there that it would freak me out like the rest of the movie did . (* possible spoiler *) All pointed to and being one and the same but , thankfully , that  t the case . It was was an all right  Aha ! in  Fight Club  but if they had done it here it would  almost ruined the movie because of the sheer cheesiness of it . (*/ end spoiler *) I think upon a second watching I might like the ending more and knowing the end will change the color of the movie for me . that sinister during the first will take on a lighter tone . As for the how the movie was shot , it  s really good . The coloration they use a lot of the movie an almost black and white look which is effective in a sense of foreboding . The way the dark were shot me of what a dark hall was like as a child . The movie is able to convey a sense of dread through the use of a color palette . I  m definitely going to recommend this movie to people and I  watch it again just so I can have foresight this time . It  be almost like watching  Identity  for the second time .",1
"written some very funny romantic in her time ( When Harry met Sally / Sleepless In / You  Got Mail ), but one to wonder why she chose to put her magical spin on a rehash of the old show  . She wisely to update the story , by making a movie about a remake of the old show , turning some of the on , BUT ... it still  t quite work . I will say that major kudos for coming off cute and adorable amidst this of homage to the old show and at modern . Her performance is stellar considering what she is given to work with and she  over the top  Will  s ( less is more Will . Less is more !) pound for pound with her turn as  s new . Also noteworthy is strutting through it all , as her warlock father and the delightful who as a grand madam , is ... well ... a grand madam who is making her comeback on the new show . also a funny cameo as a animal / props guy who why none of his sure - fire stuff  t work ( The magic with it ).  improvisational dialogue is funny at times and grating at .

Fine , I  m still with you . Throwing in Uncle at the end was a big MISTAKE . Showing clips of the delightful the real Uncle was a BIGGER MISTAKE . Two is TOO MUCH . If you were going to do that , then at least throw in a side story that this new witch is the reason the old show was written . All of the were based on her family back in the . But you did not do that . You our new name as well as her father  s , then decided to throw in real for the old show  s . ! Carrel is usually very funny .

"House of Wax is one of those where the predictability is , therefore the goodness of the film heavily on it  s content and , not necessarily it  s plot outline .

Walking into the theater i terribly acting by  s part , but of course giving the benefit of the doubt i was willing to consider , of course in the first it was obvious that i should  my . Although i may add , admit it ! half the people in the theater are there just because is also there . Nonetheless , i found the to be disturbing and psychopathic enough to freak me out a little - but only a little . Overall i found the film to be of average quality , due to its impressive special effects and somewhat intriguing characterization . Unfortunately i found there were more then there were , with the plot not taken to the of it  s potential , some bad casting , and of course one of the in a horror movie i have seen in a very long time . I  be nice 5 / 10 is as far as i  go , i find that although this film some intriguing towards it , House of Wax  t that great at being a scary horror movie , this is definitely not the definition of a great horror flick - in fact - is probably than this .",1
"Titanic is one of those that you have to see . It  s one of those that can reduce almost anybody to , if not for one then for the other . Unless you  had your head in the sand ever since this film was then you  know the two this film around . The first is the obvious one , the true story of the  unsinkable ship . The tragic tale of an unimaginable catastrophe . The second is the fictional love story , the collision of that could only have aboard the ship . The love story off pretty simple , the classic example of a romantic film plot . Boy girl and they fall in love , love is forbidden but they fight for their love and this is normally where they  d all live happily ever after . Now that  s where the first because as well all know on this ship , most of the  t survive the journey . Like I said this is a film that can reduce almost anybody to . Whether the reason is the tragic reality of the disaster that was the Titanic or the love story that touched the world . is perfect for the role of Jack , likewise , Rose and the story beautifully as the future Rose . The film itself is very poorly made by today  s , especially considering it cost more to make than the original ship did . The computer graphics are spectacularly bad , but all that insignificant . This film is a big deal and you can never fully join in film until you  seen it . Love it or hate it , it  s a story that will stick with you for a long time . The unfortunate thing is that now , think of the Titanic and you think of the tragic love story , you think of Jack and Rose . Nobody ever of the tragedy that was the  ship of .",1

Everyone is in a heavy situation , as well as the brother and sister , taken hostage inside . Hostage , I have to say is a very well directed movie and I do recommend it to those in search for a good thriller . I must add that this Drama / Suspense is over the top on Violence and Profanity . However , I think it the movie a whole lot more intense and . With superb acting from all the main and a twist that will leave you thinking , Hostage should not be . 9 / 10",0

Also , I think the director knew this movie was going to be a flop , so out of the blue he just put a sex scene in there . It  t have anything to do with the plot , it was like he just to see a chunky Tara get naked . Do you know how many got off by this film . I saw so many that i have seen from other like , X - , and basically every other movie out there . I wish i look at the on here before i watched this movie , it is in the bottom 100 !

"In the middle of the mass of , down horror and ; it  s nice to see that some still feel the need to push the bar and deliver something different . The Machinist is a deeply dark and disturbing movie that Bale as a worker in an industrial factory . If he were any , he  t exist and he  t slept in a year ; but still he to carry on his mundane existence .  t quite rosy in his life either ; strange are happening to him without explanation and it  t long before our protagonist his own sanity . Bale lost an amazing 63 for this movie , and while it might have been a struggle for the actor ; it certainly  t in vain ! Bale  s stick - like , ill appearance immensely to the film and if director Brad  t got himself such a performer in Bale , The Machinist  t have been half the film it is . Bale on numerous , and it  s about time he got praise he . Bale  s main - star is most definitely the atmosphere . Brad is keen to get down and dirty with this movie , and he  s given it a truly downbeat , gritty style . This is absolutely great to look at , especially for of macabre . The camera add to this atmosphere and help to enforce the idea that the machinist is living in his own environment . The plot works more from a premise than an actual story ; but this is good as it the director to put the focus of the story squarely on the protagonist , and his decent into insanity an ample base for an intriguing movie . The Machinist is a very encouraging film , as it that there is still room for dark , macabre in modern cinema . Brad  s feature  Session 9  that the man a real flair for atmosphere , and it will be interesting to see how his remake of Romero  s less than brilliant  The  turns out . On the whole , this film is excellent . The atmosphere is beautifully done , the acting is superb and the film to keep your interest throughout . What more could you ask for ?",1
"I eyed this movie for quite awhile before seeing it just now . Everything I saw as far as clips and such were just not funny to me . I had many it was hilarious and that made no sense to me . Usually , if I watch a movie with low , I  m and like it . That just  t the case here , the most the movie ever got was a few weak   s . It was actually more depressing than funny . I gave it a fair chance , and it was  blah . Apparently , on this one , its either love it or hate it . I  seen several on here say they  re tired of the main stream , and I agree . seem . So , I understand the desire for original comedy -- but this  t it for me .",1

"Win a Date with Tad  is undoubtedly a chick - flick and , yes , it  s fairly predictable , but I would recommend it to anyone because it  s a fantastic way to spend an hour and a half . It  s impossible not to get caught up in the cheeriness of it all and smile along with the . Plus , much of the comedy is hilarious , especially Grace  s semi - cynical one - and  spoilt . Also , you get to see both Grace and Josh topless . And chopping wood . Win a Date with Tad   t have a huge message to put across , nor does it have - million dollar special effects or incredibly famous , but it  s what I would call a  happy film . If you  re a piece of ground - breaking drama you  be sadly disappointed , because that  t what this film is supposed to be . It  s entertainment in the form possible , because it simply you . I can see why this film might be susceptible to criticism about the plot - boy - - girl , girl - - other - boy , . - but I don  t think that the acting and the script can be . The film is funny and well - paced , with both physical and verbal comedy , attractive and cheerful and an overwhelming sense of happiness throughout .

"Creep  t do what its title , it  t exactly creepy , but it is pretty violent and gruesome . The story is fairly linear and no plot that i and the acting and script are . The problem with Creep is that it  t really do anything to set it apart from the rest of the Horror crowd , but when to some its not to bad . With of horror in recent ( Toolbox , Grudge , White Noise , Descent , to name but a few ) Creep is left languishing in . For horror , its worth watching and it can hold its own in the genre . For movie in general there is not enough here to warrant your time . 6 / 10",1

"If March of the is told in a rather conventional manner for a documentary , I  m willing to forgive it because the story behind it is so compelling . When you have a story this unusual and interesting , you can  t be down by like presentation and layout . You can  t make up the that happen to these emperor . As much as I hate to spread a , truth is stranger than fiction in this case . The emperor penguin  s sole purpose , it may seem , in life is to give birth so that their kind may live for another generation . To do this , they must travel to get to a breeding ground thick enough to support them when the ice in spring . Before they reach this safe ground , they will have traveled over seventy . Keep in mind that they do not travel this distance by air ( as they are a flightless bird ) or by sea - but on foot . When they have , the of pair up and begin to mate . Sometimes it that something as simple as another penguin  s call is enough , but it is most likely their method of a suitable partner is based on a criteria we cannot possibly understand . Once the have given birth , ownership of the egg is switched from the female to the male . This reversal of gender in the natural kingdom is not unique to ( if I remember correctly , the male sea horse is the one who actually birth ), but it is interesting nonetheless . So as the male brave that can be up to 150 below zero while holding the egg under a flap of skin , the walk back to the sea to collect food for themselves , and more importantly for their baby . As we are told , the who do not return actually result in two : the mother penguin and that of her chick . Like the who are eventually forced to swim without ever seen the sea before , their journey to the breeding ground is an instinctual feeling , an evolutionary process so oft - repeated by their that it been into their head . The fact that these are traveling over seventy on foot is extraordinary enough , but that they are doing so on an instinct , to a destination they have never known , is simply astounding . Try to put this in human . Many of us cannot even get to the pizza place without in tow . How could we possibly navigate of land and find a small area on a feeling ? If there  s any one problem with the film , it  s that Morgan Freeman  s narration and even the serve to further the film  s tendency of emotionalism over logic . There  s a scene in particular I  m thinking about , right after the female feed for the first time since the march  s start . As the music with sinister , we are about a predatory sea lion scouring the sea floor in search of ( and ) a penguin to make its next meal . My problem with this scene is that it to almost look down on the sea lion . Don  t get me wrong , I  m certainly for the emperor penguin  s extended survival , but  t the sea lion just following nature  s way as well ? No , the idea that of these noble will not make it back is not a happy one . But as anyone familiar with  s idea of natural selection will tell you , it is for the best . That  s the thing about Mother Nature : she can make something as awe - inspiring as this , but she can just as quickly take it away . And although the film does end with a sense of closure , in reality they will back again next year , and the year after that . I knew that emperor mate every year , but I had always thought that spent most of the year swimming , , and generally acting like the polar from the Coca - Cola and set aside one season of the year to mate . In other , the total opposite . At any rate , this is a fine documentary about one of nature  s most intriguing .",1
"This is the best of the sappy melodramatic to come out in the past , but it is still not that great of a movie . I cannot stand Billy  s character . He is such a stereotypical rich guy , it me sick . No this is not a bad movie , but it is not great and did not deserve the academy award over LA Confidential , but that is not why I am giving it 6 out of 10 . I think this movie lost a point just by making it seem like it was Rose / fault that the Titanic sunk , remember when the watch are not doing their job and watching Jack and Rose make out instead of looking for , they make it seem like they were partially responsible for it .

"Everything we experience in life is different for everyone - 2 people can be looking at the exact same flower , for example , and each will be perceiving it entirely differently , based upon a myriad of too vast , complicated and profound to go into here . The simplistic explanation is , of course , that we have not been living the same , the same , being the same person . Van Sant  s Last Days is a film that brilliantly this phenomenon into account . By not even to compose a  standard - type scenario , with the traditional of plot , dialogue , set - , pay - , - all the  normal  that most people expect a movie to give them ( a commercial movie , anyway ), he something much , much and far more profound : he given us a motion picture that as free - form poetry or as a song , where the   are exceedingly more non - literal and abstract . In an artfully written poem ( as with a great song ), the ( or ) exist in their own reality , and that reality as they unfold , each moment to be the impetus for the next . It sense , a good poem ( or song ), even if you can  t exactly explain what it  s about , what every word or phrase actually - it  s the FEELING you get from it that you every time you read it ( or hear it ), and if you try to explain to other people what you feel about it , they most likely will not feel exactly what you feel , even if you find people who share your deep connection to the poem ( or the song ). Last Days , from the very first to the very final and beyond . Of course Van Sant  t there with on his last days on this planet , and of course he no idea what really was going on in  s mind during that period ( or any other ). He  t presume to try to give us that . What we get , rather , is a soulful , lovingly heartfelt meditation on one individual  s state of being . The person in question to have been a supremely gifted musician , whose music came from a place of magnificent purity and intense pain , a person who , through his music , spoke to a generation in a way that only a musician ( or a writer ) could . This is as well , in the movie  s best , where ( who more than in this performance - there are no for what he here ) music ; in the midst of his near - incoherent primal state , he is still in touch with his essence , his soul - the music . If you go into this movie thinking it will explain to you who was , or if you think it will match some image you have in your head of who he was or might have been , you  be disappointed . Or if you stumble into the not even knowing much about its subject , you might not understand what  s being here . I was a very big follower of Nirvana , and particularly , , who of course was the soul of the band . I had a strong feeling for him and a supreme respect for what he was able to wrench out of himself , vocally , lyrically , all the rest .

"Recently I this movie again . Although the story becomes starting with the and beyond sequence , nevertheless the movie praise for its special effects and its attempt to delve into the of man . And although the story little action and sparse , it nevertheless in engaging the audience  s attention and a certain level of suspense , at least for the majority of the film . The problem is that the film not with a bang but with a thud . What off as being intriguing and at times almost sublime in a quagmire of uncertainty as the audience is left wondering what to make of the final . Leaving the audience guessing is not a good way to end a movie and for that reason the movie can be only as a qualified success . When I first saw this movie ago , I was so by the music and special effects that I would have rated it a 10 . But , alas , time on and so does my taste in . Recently I to watch this movie again and to my chagrin I found it BORING . What made the movie even more unpalatable was the pretentious and story ... or message ... or cryptic allegory ... or whatever , that left me feeling profoundly . What the heck is this movie about anyway ? I the beginning with the around in monkey screaming at each and fighting and , well , acting a lot like people , but when the movie the obelisk ... and then the space station ... and then the talking computer with an attitude ... and then the astronaut growing old ... and then a baby in a capsule looking at earth ... I knew that somewhere there was a message , but it was a message not received by me because frankly , my dear , I  t give a hoot . The one character in the movie I , in fact the only character in the movie that is worthy of the term  character , was the computer . If the movie had just been about the computer , and how well he ... or she ... or it ... sang  Daisy , I might have this movie a lot more . This movie is an example of people getting in the way of a perfectly good story . Let the computer explore space . People have more important to do .",0

"Hotel is a great film . Yes , it direct to a very heart - part of history , but what it powerful is the strong performance by Don , an excellent supporting cast , great direction and storytelling . I love like this . I very much enjoy with historical , even if their not always accurate ( not a problem with this film ). But anyone can make a drama based on historical . What to film is the event the proper focus and around a handful of important .  Hotel  does just that : it the genocide as it within a few square with the hotel as a focal point .

"Titanic is  s biggest in history and for good reason - it is a great movie . This movie is about sacrifice , selflessness , love , devotion , joy , passion , all on a ocean liner that suddenly and without warning , resulting in one of the worst maritime in history . is magnificent as the young girl , Rose , barely a , who is being by her overbearing mother to marry Cal , a nasty , brutal man who only contempt for his unwilling . That Cal is rich just his behavior worse . Rose , by nature a gentle spirit , is angry and desperate to escape , so much so that she is about to commit suicide when she is saved by a young man , Jack , who , despite his shabby appearance , is a well - traveled , sensitive and upbeat artist who the young lady with gentleness and respect and she . Their love for each other is instantaneous and unconditional and they are willing to die for each other . This is not such an implausible scenario and there is absolutely nothing immoral about their behavior . Rose willingly herself to Jack out of love for him , and even later still of him as her one and only true love , the man who for her so she could live . That is love . That is sacrifice . That is life . That is . That they were not formally married is a mere technicality . Given the of their meeting . a loving and understanding G - d will forgive them . Now regarding the diamond that was given to Rose , instead of it in like she could have , she kept it as a memento to her one true love . That is character . Nothing unchristian about that . Indeed , the movie is actually about how Rose a complete transformation from a passive , unhappy , moody adolescent into a composed , mature , independent and beautiful woman , even her name , now prepared to go on to live a long and active life . That is , she an . That is personal growth which is quite and most exemplary . As for Jack , he is with Rose in spirit and she her life accordingly , knowing that if it were not for him she would not have . Jack gave his life for Rose so she could live . That is powerfully compelling and completely consistent with . Maybe I  t say this , but I will : I was waiting for the ship to sink because I was that when the ship sank the movie would end ... but it  t , and for that I was disappointed . To me , the story of the the Titanic is what to the ship , not some , fictional , and highly improbable love story between a Little Miss Rich Girl and a . Nice Guy Ne  er Do Well . The movie is weak for two : First , the movie is me to believe that a young lady would dump her handsome , powerful , influential and above - all wealthy who her mother  s approval in favor of a no - account nobody who  t even belong on the ship . Second , since we already know what  s going to happen to the ship , much of the excitement is lost . Nevertheless , the portrayal of how the ship actually sank , and the resulting pandemonium , was effectively done . So if the movie had gotten rid of the love story and concentrated instead on how the and crew with the impending sinking of the ship , that could have been the basis for an exceedingly dramatic story . But being , if the story  t include at least a smidgen of sex and a big dose of sentimentality , no matter how , then that story won  t be the one that it onto the screen , and this movie is proof of that statement . As further proof of that statement consider the final scene in which Little Miss Rich Girl , who  s now something like 100 old and a great - grandmother , a multimillion - dollar diamond overboard in the name of love . Even for a movie that  s unbelievable . It would have been better if she had used the diamond to pay for a salvaging operation to recover the divan on which she had nude for her , . Nobody , who , by sheer coincidence , also to be an accomplished artist . ( !) Now THAT would have made for a good story . The movie could have been :  The Titanic - The Story of a Woman and the Divan that Made Her Famous . Now if somebody out there would like to advance me 50 or 100 million to make this movie , then we  be in business .",1

I am glad that the gore factor was kept down to a minimum , as when it was used , it certainly the experience . Bale is superb and I feel that its a pity that he does not get the credit that he , both his physical transformation for this , and his acting was some of the best I have seen for a while .

"Gone is and so Alfonso . Strike up the band , paint a banner , and the parade will be here in a few .

But when I thought about it , and as I read the 6th book , I that Harry  s world  t always a bright and colorful world with a blockbuster and cheap special effects . So in a way , this movie a nice transition between the first of the series and the later more , at least for the . Personally , I the new sound of the . remains as fresh as ever and the medieval music is very good and appropriate , combined with the old . Some are sorely though . One thing in particular , is as Dumbledore . is by no a bad actor , but him as Dumbledore wearing a beanie just  t work .  dumbledore had that warmth and authority that perfectly caught the essence of the character in the . There  s nothing they can do about it , but I think would have been a better choice , or maybe even . The only thing that this movie a little subordinate to the  s Stone is the end , which i thought a little substance and could have been better given how the book ended . There were just a few little that it could have added to make it that much more powerful , but they decided to make the movie that much shorter . Still , this is a very good movie and I eagerly anticipate the next movie . Mischief .",0
"Spoiler alert . I really this movie . And it me that I am one of only a few . To me , the film was heavily by several 90s and slasher ( Se7en , especially ) and the story basically on old and shock value . The violence was disgusting and often ridiculous , and I sort of feel like the people that did this movie thought they had to make it really gross to be scary . Most of the as though they were trying to just scare the out of the viewer without any sort of suspense or fear . For example , a woman to dig around in the stomach of her - up friend so her head  t explode . Why ?? What the hell is the point of that ? It  s just stupid . And in the final scene , why did the guy have to saw through his foot ?! I mean , c  mon . There were ways around that . He just to snap , and suddenly the fact that the key to his shackle was just a few away was irrelevant . , I admit that the cinematography was sort of cool ... But ? Good god . He was great in  The Princess Bride ,  Robin Hood : Men in Tights , and as the villain in a variety of family and action . But in  Saw  he was truly awful . I think my local newspaper stated it best in a caption under a photo of in  Saw :  Mommy , please make the bad actor go away . In conclusion ,  Saw  was an interesting concept that was executed horribly . But I  m probably just crazy , because everyone else in the world to love it .",1
"This movie is my movie , a little bit of action some good scary and a few funny too . The best thing about this movie was that it could actually happen although not a true story , The movie is about a sick maniac person who a history of taunting people and them , and then locking them in a room with there . What a movie ! huh see for yourself ! i recommend this movie for anyone who can handle Blood and Gore ... or 13 , 14 plus . the only setback is of course a few blood gory . well please tell me if you what i wrote here by yes or no .... i would love to here your feedback .......",1
"The plot was slow and mediocre on a good day ( see : ). This is the usual Liberal Mantra of We Know Better Than You . Any of the feeble involved in this dogma could have a commune or settlement . Instead they remove any choice their offspring might of had . Why ? Mindlessly doing as your told is the corner stone of the , and . As long is it is what they tell you . I was terribly disappointed in Weaver doing this movie . After  Death and the Maiden ( 1994 ), a terrific drama and  Galaxy Quest ( 1999 ), an amazing comedy and spoof of - Fi , to lower herself to drivel like this , Shame , Shame , Shame . Well even the best can have a bad day . all hope for no more as bad as this one was . Not to see Holden .

"Not your average thriller or - drama , this film is unbelievably good - and as freaky as they come . It  s intense , totally gripping and scary .

I was as as I  ever been watching a film and then , the next minute , I was weeping like a baby . A truly deep and powerful , lovely movie . Imaginative and amazing . Really brilliant . I  d go so far as to say it should be for anyone film or screen writing . And I now realize Bale , one of the going , is also one of the most .",1

"Several younger , posing as , have their post - 1994 angst onto  The High and the Mighty . They have tried to make its into I suggest because they have to understand the normative , non - self - responsibility that in the 1950s tacitly accepted as their price for U . S . under regulation . They also do not understand apparently that this flight was being as a very - long flight , and barely seven after the end of . One that there was talk of disaster from the beginning ; I found none except some fear on the part of one neurotic passenger . And there is something else that needs to be said about the film . It was directed by Wellman , aviation  s champion in history . That may be one reason why the resulting film is in my judgment the most realistic portrayal of a 1950s airport , airplane crew , airplane flight and airplane disaster - near disaster film in history -- to this day ... I flew on prop in 1950 ; this is the real thing . As for the emotional belief that it is  corny , its script some of its concerning  , but only the philosophy of statist - could see in this beautifully - thought - out film as anything but what most believe it to be -- the very entertaining fictional account of a saving an entire of interesting from a physical disaster to whose impending happening each in his own individual way . The film at Airport as flight 420 is being for . A succession of come to the desk by an official and the flight  s stewardess ; so the viewer is thus cleverly to discover a good bit about each one at the same time as do the refreshingly pair of . At the same time , we are told the story of nice - guy Dan , by ; he was the pilot of a plane that once ran into wind shear ; the rear of that plane was ; on impact .; he the death of his wife and son to fly again . The list of those aboard is long and fascinating . In addition to cynical young crewman , uxorious navigator Wally Brown , up - tight young Stack and , we meet , overwrought and insistent ; ebullient and his wife Ann , sensible and prolific , intelligent , Sterling as an aging beauty queen worried about meeting her new mail - contact , handsome couple Smith and as , Fix who is elderly and , , , flight - Newton and his loyal wife lovely Bishop , secret - keeping Kelly and dynamic , and a little boy , among . The story as the great airplane in mid - air ; gradually a crisis with an engine losing power . Then it is hit by a bullet , and a fire it and must be extinguished . The exact number of of high - octane fuel aboard then becomes critical . The threat of a disaster is told in five -- the inception ; and ; the potential of to ditch is faced ; Stack to try for the coast instead of ; and the final climax out as the onshore wind them their last chance to make one try at the runway -- with ultimately only 30 of fuel left . As the potential problem , the and crew must deal with the film  s plot - theme -- taking charge of one  s own life ; one man a gun on the man he of made love to his wife ; have to be stopped from screaming , face long put aside , express , or ; demand or ask for information ; and the crew face their own as well . Uniting the whole taut drama is the towering experience , calm and by and the thin - voice maturity , intelligence and normalcy of Doe as the chief stewardess . The other unusual feature of the film is Wellman  s use of extended for a number of , which is a feature that to information as well as passage of time . Here it is used in several innovative ways - to indicate character , to reinforce dramatic and to strengthen the presentation of such as a nuclear scientist  s for his job , . The script for the novel was written by the author of the original novel  The High and the Mighty , aviation fiction expert K . . The cinematography was done by J . Stout , and the music which whistling the main theme among other was done by , - author of the famous and popular title song , which was a hit both with and without . Among the solid cast also one should note , Day , , and . Among the main , , , , , , Bishop , Newton , , and Stack all do standout work . The scene where luggage is to lighten the plane , the gradual revelation of the aircraft  s , the dialogue and the entire atmosphere of the film -- as well as the gripping climactic approach to San -- are all memorable . in my view . Watch for  s explanation that they will probably have to ditch , to all the . This is a nearly - great and unarguably a deservedly popular film .",1

"This was a loving tribute to ? It was absolute garbage , even if a viewer had not read the book , to the radio series , saw the series it was a rubbish film . The plot was very loosely based on the book , the film was totally disjointed , there were hardly any to the Guide itself , Ford Prefect like he was stoned for all the film . The the Galactic police force it , Deep Thought into a woman , Dent a babe magnet , was in reality a very clever person who had to divide his brain to become the President ?

"is one lucky guy . At the start of 2004 , he was just the lowly star of some of that rubbish that put on ; but by the end of the year , he  s the director , writer and star of a successful and critically movie !

The film of maturity and responsibility and it a young man ( ), who home to his state of New Jersey after a leave of nine . While home he with his old and a new one , in the form of serial liar ; ( Portman ). Pretty much as soon as the film , you can see that it  s by a young , first time , director .

Considering he  s a actor ,  s acting  t at all bad ; he the role that he  s written himself like a glove , and his performance the whole piece an element of realism . The extraordinarily beautiful Portman alongside as his opposite number . Portman her performance with just the right amount of cuteness , while slightly that her character might not quite be all and sweetness .

"Being a fan of after first watching her in , I was looking forward to seeing Creep , for a good scare and a great performance . Unfortunately this film provided neither .

Her performance was dull and frequently unconvincing . It  s not that she  t know what to do with a horror movie , as her acting in was good as always . This film me appreciate a movie like the Ring even more : the way the director in at often unexpected and the fact that the scary part is not so much bloody as fantastic tension throughout the movie that more to do with your own imagination taking over .* * Way too much of this film had no logic at all . I  m not talking about the fact that she through dark alone or other recognizable horror stuff , but about more profound . When she in the subway for instance , she asleep - necessary because she to get stuck there after all - but it  s completely nonsensical in the sense that she is all wound up before . Falling asleep therefore is a film - necessity but very unbelievable . Later on , she her - prisoner to swim underneath , while she herself can do it a lot better ( she is closer ). But , she to ask ; after all , we already know the guy cannot swim , so we have to go through this motion first . She seriously the creep , but to kill him at three . When a horror flick is made well , that might work , but here it just you edgy watching ( just kill him , girl and get it over with ). I could say a lot more , but really , what  s the use . * End of * I  t advise anyone to see this movie . Even if you travel by subway , it  s really not worth your time .",1

But I personally still believe that she knew better but went along and this movie and the documentary suggest there are some people or at least believing her . This is the most expensive German production ever made and it . Especially the sound and sound works impressive as we have the and fighting always going on in the foreground or background . Every time a person the bunker as an ordinary place to live , a sound ( loud or soft ) can be . The confined space within the bunker is also what this work with the opportunity to make of the long central hall where a lot of drama can be with a distant camera - eye . By the viewer spend such amount of time in the bunker the and drama becomes only clearer . The war outside is used to create the contrast with the relative tranquility within and to show the difference between the suffering of the people and the madman inside that never once for them in the end . But the action outside is too sketchy , most are anonymous so it it hard to identify with any of them . This  t on the level of Saving Private , by now the standard for war . With  s background as - man this is a well made documentary dressed as fiction , but that alone does not make cinema . There are a couple of that reach that level : Speer shown in the end in front of one of his own neo - classical , a boy from a battle scene and we hear gunfire only to find out later it is the typewriter of the secretary , the of the of the with the suicidal of a male and female - soldier . The fall of never comes unexpectedly , and although such do not disappear in an instant , they ultimately dissolve in a few days . As the end , is shown increasingly as an idiot losing all sense for reality and giving random , , and still . The only thing important to him is dog - like loyalty . From his loyal we see a range of : From the true believer , sacrificing his whole family and his own , to the pragmatic , the loyal ( but not to every price ) Speer and the human . did what the from him . He was a simple man with a humble background and limited who luckily in what he tried to accomplish . He saw as more ruthless , which to an extent is historically true , although their are of the same . This movie stays close to the known , and is therefore interesting as a history lesson . But for those familiar with all this is only an annotation , and for those not familiar it a proper introduction in all the . Unfortunately it may send the wrong message : showing ( perfectly by ) as just a human being ( soft spoken , animal lover and a vegetarian , all true by the way ) it may be an attractive document for neo - too . So , to what end was this made , because there could be a somewhat message like  s Das Experiment .",0
"I this to be quite a scary film with all the voodoo magic and story line in the film , unfortunately the film a limited  jolt  factor and not enough .

The film of with a rather slow beginning and a rather rapid / rushed ending . It is also quite predictable , and I could see where it was going pretty much from the very beginning .. although quite clever in , its all been done before and is the usual stuff out every few in another form . her usual arrogant self , with the film revolving around her desire to look after / protect the old man she is meant to be for at the expense of her own safety .... not bloody likely , when you see half the stuff that  s going on in that house ! I  m it  t go straight to , and it like it got an release in the than the US , I don  t know why that was , possibly testing the in a smaller market to save it from a big flop in the US ? well have to wait and see .. For a voodoo film I  d say its quite good , a few good here and there , if your a horror you might be slightly disappointed , but for a drama / thriller / mystery its quite good I suppose , for a real scare watch  The Descent  which a much higher  jolt  factor if you  re into that kind of thing !",1

"I  t with  Hide and Seek . If you  seen Secret Window or any of the recent horror = with of an identical twist , you  understand how tired and utterly formulaic this become . Hide and Seek imagination anyways because the viewer is to be confounded by a series of disconnected scare tactics such as of , the last minute awareness of the culprit before the death of an unsuspecting victim , and above all , modern horror - thriller determined to creep you out with some . All the while , however , the story is very thin : that of a father and his young daughter coping with the gruesome death of the wife / mother who supposedly slit her in the bathtub where she to death . However , we are led to believe that in fact , her death was no accident . And the weird little girl and her mysterious , elusive friend  , seem to be behind the whole thing as they taunt the father who just to want to get on with . Something like  The Omen , if you will . But , it  t end that way , of course . Instead , a cast of pretty good star in a film of cheap and an even ending ( the infamous last scene where you think that all is well until there is some last minute evidence that in fact , the evil will continue unabated ). Formula one hundred percent . If you  seen like  Secret Window  or  Taking  or other similar pseudo - mind ( sorry , other don  t come to mind at the moment ), then you  re in for nothing new if you watch  Hide and Seek .

"The Hitchhiker  s Guide to the Galaxy  the feel of a movie that  s taken the long route to the screen . The fact that , deceased by a few , both screenplay and executive producer would seem to confirm this . It  s tough turning beloved cult into , and  Hitchhiker  s  is no exception . The good news for of  interstellar celebration of absurdity is that the movie actually quite a bit right . Yet it from an odd patchwork feel that the virtually reading to have the inkling of what  s going on . Any story the demolition of earth for an bypass , planet - size , infinite improbability , and poetry - space a bit of explaining to do . , gifted with a rare verbal dexterity , was in his able to introduce and discard such with a comic insouciance that somehow more of less made sense . The film a tendency to get stuck , though ; it  s neither able to juggle all this goofiness with  deft touch , nor provide any context for . Those familiar with the will get , for example , what  s so important about , and why Galactic President two and three arms , and will perhaps forgive the film for its fairly presentation of such . But  Hitchhiker  s  is full of that will leave new scratching their . The film the unfortunate decision to highlight the silliness through , rather than  offbeat dialogue . The effects and production design assume a deliberate cheesiness in an attempt to match the story  s tone , but end up looking like a strange marriage of  The Show  and  . Who . The movie is eager to cram in as many of  comic as possible , but too often does so at the expense of continuity . It from one oddity to the next , treating them more as than of a coherent whole . Nonetheless , there are a nice of a few of the author  s delightful , such as the pleasantly sighing of the  spaceship , and a philosophical sperm whale for a tragic end . The jumble of activity that  Hitchhiker  s  to balance leaves its , among them earthling Dent ( Martin Freeman ) and his space jockey friend Ford Prefect ( ), so to that they can  t create fully - formed . Too often we get a without the set up . A film adaptation of any book needs to be accessible to non - ; it  s unfair to rely upon to fill in the with a background familiarity they may not possess . Love it or hate it ,  Hitchhiker  s  will at least get the gist of this movie . For anyone else , though , the book , at a quick 200 , will be a far more satisfying and coherent alternative .",0

The Notebook me cry every time I watch it but I can  t help but watch it whenever I can . I love Gosling and both separately and as an on - screen couple . The movie was very well done . I thought the snobbish mother to perfection . I like the way Gosling  s character was in contrast to  s character . I love the fact that even though they all the time they each other unconditionally . I especially like the fact that he never left her side even through her illness . Nobody a story like Sparks and I hope he writing . I want to see more from Gosling , he is SEXY !!! I him in Remember the also . He especially good with the facial hair .

The sight of , Stack , and other in a situation that was quite unique when . We real human drama and a personal glimpse of how we could have if we were there . It was very enjoyable to watch a very well made movie with an excellent cast of and a well - written script . And the music was super too .

"It was brave of to attempt an undertaking on this scale . Making the world  s most expensive movie ever is always to tempt fate ; the film which had previously that distinction , the vanity project  , had been a disaster in both financial and artistic . Even before  Titanic  was finished , were that it would be equally disastrous ; the their  sinking ship  in anticipation of its failure . In the event , of course , the were confounded ; the film was a great success , both at the box office and with the Academy , who it eleven best picture and best director . It the most - about film of 1997 . Eight on there have been other on a similar epic scale and some of the excitement it away . Nevertheless , even today it out as a fine achievement . Titanic  two quite different , the disaster movie and the  heritage  costume drama . The late saw a modest revival of the disaster picture , that quintessentially genre , with  Twister  in 1996 and   s Peak  and  Volcano  the following year . took the basic formula for such and applied it to a real historical event , making a film on a grand scale with lavish attention to period detail . The real Titanic sinking had a number of which fitted the genre ; it is something of a convention of disaster that the disaster should be , or at least , by the incompetence or complacency of those in authority , an element here . , the Chairman of the White Star Line , proudly the ship unsinkable , then the disaster by urging the captain to steam at top speed through an ice - field . To make worse , the company have to provide sufficient for all on board . also into the film some of the of  heritage cinema . That genre often been used to examine the class system , often in which feature between from different social , such as  s  The Go - Between  or Merchant - Ivory like   s End . the same concept and the film to examine the historical of the class system , of which the ship , with its first , second and third class , is a microcosm . with the story of the tragedy is the story of the romance between Rose , daughter of an aristocratic family , and Jack , a struggling artist from a working - class background . The that we see is not , as is sometimes said , a society , nor even one where class is solely determined by wealth . The , for all their old - money , are in financial , and Rose  s late father heavily in debt . Rose  s mother Ruth that the only way to maintain the family  s social status will be if Rose a  good  marriage to a wealthy man , and a seemingly ideal candidate himself in the shape of Cal , the son of a - industrialist . Unfortunately , Cal is an arrogant , selfish snob , and Rose cannot bear the thought of marriage to him . She suicide by throwing herself off the ship , but is from doing so by Jack , and the two fall in love . Some have the film for on the romance of Jack and Rose , that this focus is somehow to a real - life tragedy in which over a thousand people . This is not a criticism with which I would agree . It would clearly have been impossible to tell the personal of all those who ;  s aim was to put the disaster into context and heighten its impact by giving us two we can care about and to make their story representative of the of all those caught up in the drama , thus the film  s emotional impact . The film a number of . The taken with historical accuracy , such as the denigration of the character of ( who in real life bravely ), can sometimes seem offensive . The opening and , which deal with the of a modern salvage team to recover from the wreck a valuable jewel given by Cal to Rose , were possibly unnecessary and certainly overlong , and could easily have been . The acting is not always very good ; I was less than by Di as Jack . ( In fairness it must be said that he greatly as an actor since 1997 , given a good performance in  Catch Me If You Can  and an excellent one in  The Aviator ). as Rose was better , although even she fell short of the brilliance she had shown in  Heavenly . The are , however , greatly by the film  s . A special mention must go to Horner  s evocative score and  s song  My Heart Will Go On . There are a number of good in minor , from as Molly Brown , as vulgar by her fellow first - class but more good - hearted than any of them , Hill as Captain Smith , a decent man but without the strength of character to stand up to  s bullying , and Fisher as Ruth , a woman who her social status ahead of her daughter  s happiness . In the end , however , this is not a film one for the acting . I would agree with the reviewer who said that the real star is neither nor but rather the great ship itself , particularly during the spectacular after it the iceberg . The success of  Titanic  gave back the self - confidence to make on a grand scale with daring , energy and imagination , leading to recent such as  Gladiator  and  Troy . 8 / 10",1

This is one viewer who is tired to death of trite in film - making , and this film trite by a mile . I  m not a film expert by any , just a thoughtful person who with curiosity and an open mind .

"Obviously Bale is absolutely one of the only with conviction left in this full of egotistical pretty ( with the exception of a few awesome and ). This performance will probably go down as one of his best . I definitely have even more respect for him after seeing this movie . Now , with that said , id like to just comment on the movie . the story is a very cool , very sleek version of memento fight club . its still original enough to definitely hold its own , but i think the end of the movie completely apart . the movie at a good pace and you to really get into  s life . But at the 1 15 min mark , it all to just rush to the end . throughout the movie you are trying to figure out whats going on and who exactly everyone really is . This is futile though , because there really  t any thrown out that anyone could possibly pick up on that lead you anywhere near what the truth is . In the last 15 of the movie , everything just ( with the exception of why the hell on his or who he is for that matter ) and its all wrapped up and like a gift to you , eerily like a King novel . this is an extreme disappointment as all the you develop throughout the movie become null and void . The movie an extremely awesome look and feel and i think the crew did an absolutely awesome job of you into this very eccentric world of sleep deprivation . all in all id say the movie is worth seeing , if not just for seeing these and acting their hearts out for a relatively independent film .",1

"It  s a bit of an ordeal to read through the user on Land of the Dead - they range from every extreme to every other ; some say there  s too much of this or that , while claim there  s too little of the same . Oh well . Anyway , I am not a particular fan of or horror , but I am a fan of social commentary , and that  s what  s interesting about Romero  s zombie . The high point , as most people agree , was 1978  s Dawn of the Dead , in which the mindless . Since then , not much in society on this account , except that people have become even less aware of social - a good example was the 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake , which was sadly of any social commentary whatsoever . Land of the Dead Romero return to the social commentary , and commendably it  s quite radical . Here , the have taken on a new symbolism ; now they represent the poor , the working classes , who , fed up with being reduced to an inhuman existence , finally develop a sense of compassion and solidarity for their fellow zombie ( i . e ., on the non - literal level , human being ), and , down decadent capitalism . This is great . I have no problem with the movie not being in proper continuity with the previous ; this one is its own story , and should be independently . , I was neither nor . It  t terribly grisly , and the horror effects  t really affect me ( but then , they rarely do ). Unfortunately , the story is not fully rounded . If the are the good , then what about the ( good ? Neutral ?) human ? What do they signify ? And if I have a main complaint about the movie , it  s probably  s part . That girl is the thing on the northern hemisphere , and here she had hardly anything to do , nor was her character at all . There must have been a reason for her being thrown into the zombie cage in the first place , but this is not . I was also disappointed that there was no romantic or sexual interaction between her and the main guy . All they was to exchange bedroom at the end . Not so much as a kiss did we see . Drat ! Still , Land of the Dead was a successful movie in of symbolical content . All in all , pretty good . Not on par with Dawn of the Dead , of course , but in my opinion probably the second - best of Romero  s zombie . 8 out of 10 .",1

"With an entirely different director , by a different style , the third installment of the Harry Potter series had people whether or not this film would be as entertaining and refreshing as its . As for me , it not only was entertaining , but better and more adult than its . When such a movie to its original novel , it  s hard to say how along the this particular movie . With several crucial missing , it left faithful Potter to throw their popcorn to the screen , and babbling about  s terrible job on the movie . I , read the series , do agree that the film could have done well and made more sense with what had been cut . However , most forget to think of this movie as a movie alone -- with no thought of the novel from which it was derived . Instead of it to its novel twin , it with its would be more accurate . As the series , the , therefore the , get better , as well as the acting . As the continue to get , the continue to mature .  s performance , unfortunately , was a bit of a disappointment . since  Sorcerer  s / Philosopher  s Stone , his performance was still less than for the third installment and for the character he .

She grown to be one of the and most respectable teenage for this generation . a natural talent for being . It was almost as if he were born to play the part . He IS .

This was by far the best way I have seen a Harry Potter film . should have directed all three . His style of was really riveting . Thus , I give Harry Potter and the Prisoner of a 9 / 10 rating . .",0

The irony is that this career - making role for the young that  Last Days  is one in which he only and hardly . But he and and becomes his role as few you will see this year have done . He goes to a dangerous and disturbing place .

The mumbling is eerie , it  s eavesdropping without insight for us . As he to the house , about , makeshift in the kitchen , on a dress and a shotgun , the lack of human interaction home as no dialogue - written ever could how isolated and mad he become .

Random who  re let inside are grotesque and comic : first it  s but cute twin Mormon  , then a large well - spoken black man selling a renewal of a Yellow ad from the year before .  How  s your day been so far ? he as an opener .  . it  s another day . Blake . He  s in a rote sort of way but there  s little indication he what he  s talking about . There  s a detective and a young man who once knew Blake , who them and other people by running outside to the again . These two are neither sinister nor funny : they just are . They  re just , like everybody else , into Blake  s lost world . The method in this trilogy in common that it quiet acceptance of the ; that if you give yourself up to its sometimes real time ( especially in  , where Van Sant they  re by Tarr ), they  re hypnotic and special , and if you don  t , they  re just irritating and boring . The experience a lot from the viewer . It  s hard to describe a movie in which little . Nothing turns out to be quite a lot and you might remember that wrote a long detailed novel about the in the life of a little man in a single day in . It  s certainly important that is deeply in character . If his acting were mannered or theatrical or unfelt , nothing would work . When he finally one song , a plangent cry of despair with the refrain ,  It  s a long lonely journey from death to birth , it  s very , but  s own song and passionate , exciting performance . There  s a kind of climax here , but there  s nobody ( but us ) to witness it . Luke and are up in bed with each other . As in  Elephant , several repeat . Blake to be dying repeatedly , as upon him lying on the floor and he to nod out , though you never see him do and maybe it  s just the after effect of them from long before . Finally he  s gone . We don  t see him do that either . His soul quietly naked up out of his supine body , like a photo . Then there  s all the police , the ambulance , and the other sneak off , as Blake did . It  s all a pageant . I felt right at home in it , , the days of the : it was there for me . I know it was Rock and , to whom this film is , in 1994 , at 26 . The point is that it real . But its relation to real is tangential . And if you give yourself to it and take it in its own context it  s a wonderful film , a beautiful funny - sad experience of - damned youth and a deeply felt meditation on isolation and death .",1
"I personally have never seen the other crow but I highly recommend this movie . I thought it was truly amazing . The transformation . Wow . to really look deep inside someone . Easy to follow for anyone above like 13 +. into consideration whether you pay attention or not . Some graphic . Like one or two sex . The first part of the movie I found a little boring but after the first 10 it into something really worth watching . This movie made me want to see the other Crow . This movie had a certain sort of creativity . Good story line . Also I the music . One of the was done by the one of the film .",1

"Even though  The Sixth Sense  came first , in more dough , and established that ! third act twist that re - defined everything that had gone on before ,  Fight Club  took a route that was more psychological ( and satirical ) and less and ultimately at the box office for being too damn subversive and for a bare - movie about , y  know , beating each other up . In that film , we follow an insomniac narrator who charge of his nihilistic life with the aid of anti - corporate crusader , who up being nothing more than a figment of the narrator  s imagination . It  s a testament to the cleverness and believability of this twist that it been pretty successfully in subsequent like  Session 9 ,  Secret Window ,  High Tension , and now  The Machinist , a film as frightening as it is compelling , with an uncanny psychological depth and a keen eye for detail . Like the ,  The Machinist  is quite upon first glance -- its ending the viewer to all but re - start the movie to find out what it all . Patience is essential to get into the rhythm of the film , which is deliberately paced and gradually to its turns , both and unexpected . If you expect a movie to lay down all the , explain every detail , and come to a tidy conclusion , you might want to bypass  The Machinist . Directed by Brad ( who helmed the brilliant  Session 9 ) from a script by ( the same man who us with the loathsome  Massacre  remake ),  The Machinist  is the tale of ( Bale ), an industrial worker immense of guilt for unknown -- he  t slept in a year as a result , and starved himself down to a dangerously low weight ( though the image of an Bale is not the film  s most harrowing aspect ); his and are uneasy around him , and one day he a gruesome accident while distracted by the mysterious ( a brilliantly cast ), a fellow worker who might not even exist . Anchored to reality by a sympathetic hooker ( ) and an airport waitress ( - ), is plagued by cryptic on post - it that somehow wind up in his apartment , the most grim being a 6 - letter hangman with two already filled in . In the paranoid stew brought about by his guilt ,  s perception becomes that of a mad conspiracy theorist who the ultimate plot is against himself ... and who is to say it  t ? There is a brilliant sequence within the bowels of a carnival ride , where every image -- from a corpse with its to the inside a brothel -- a twinge of panic in that us wonder how much of this is an actual ride , and how much is ( or ) by his guilt - conscience . The ultimate beauty of  The Machinist  is that it past its revelation because the world we have just watch unfold , with we THOUGHT we knew , turns out to be the product of a sleep - ( and , at a whole year , certifiably insane ) mind ; at the same time , this also the kind of person to be in the wake of the crime he . The film  s title and the oppressive , grease - factory environment it to a moody metaphor : was really a machinist , or was the scenario a representation of his swaying conscience , as turn clockwise and counterclockwise inside metal as are turned on or off and are at times unstoppable for discernible reason , thus causing unforeseen tragedy ? In addition to its ,  The Machinist  is calmly effortless in showing how clever it is without being showy -- which is why the film multiple . The amount of and character flip - and real - life into  s remorseful fantasy world is done with an incredible amount of care . Seemingly trivial , like a fishing rod on a closet shelf ; a close - up of a sticker ; the image of bumper in the foreground while to the waitress  son , all have a soul - shattering impact that is impossible to uncover upon a single . Like the bastard child of  Spider  and  Fight Club ,  The Machinist  is a persistent challenge , an ultimately bleak glimpse into the life of a man whose mind been by guilt even more so than his body .",1
"I just saw it , and it  s late , so I can  t be very expressive . But I thought it is an excellent movie . There is so much woven into it , I  m sure it  s going to be worth seeing again and again . I think it was well written and too ; everything all worked together . Despite some common , there was so much unexpected too , which  t happen much . I just the subtle , subtle life - like humor . I  m the critical community  t pick up on it more . I bet it did well in . The balanced each other well . I the fact that I rarely was thinking  This is a Bill movie  or  I  m watching . No one was drawing attention to themselves ; they were all totally telling a story . I think the disconnect from the that many of us feel in the beginning is deliberate . I think the director us to feel as dubious about the protagonist as he is feeling about himself . I  m not familiar with  s work , but now I want to be . Such a funny , thoughtful , funny movie .",0
"Although at times a little melodramatic , and probably more of a drama than comedy - this movie with good character development and interaction . One of the better of the film is that with multiple work as well as with one - on - one  s . With strong from and and a quirky and at times insightful script , the movie good and pep .  t know the director was one of the main supporting cast , but he sort of a Ben Stiller - esquire persona without the slapstick or crudeness in support . The wedding scene with he and was one of the better in the movie , with character cutting right into social of age . really out in her misery , bluntness , and sometimes tactless behavior with her . And the of middle - age and loneliness , often , are done with some sly humor - there is some cynicism here from the that is nicely balanced with adolescent of the character - the bathroom with / are a well written evolution , indicative of character growth . The growth of their relationship is entertaining and believable with some minor ( like kicking the door in ). The younger give support - the more interesting being the younger 2 , while the older 2 seem a little less dynamic in their , but not bad . This is a rental for anyone looking for a quirky sometimes insightful drama with a focus on great character interaction more than plot or story . Pretty good .",1
"A movie about ? Why not ? He like a good man , the salt of the earth , who all of adversity to become the heavyweight champion . Not a bad story at all ... but so what ?

Or what about a movie about the life and career of , the middleweight champion in the history of boxing ?

I really like the fact that I was to be in most as the effects were very impressive . The cast ( especially ) were superb in that  eerie  quality that you can really experience whilst at the cinema ... and as a group they really unpredictably meshed well together .

"It must be tough being director M . Night . He built a career off of with unexpected turns , and I imagine with each movie it must get harder to come up with something . So while The Village only two real , one of which is surprising but no more so than many other by more obscure and the other of which I fully from the beginning of the film , I have to be fair and say , well , you can  t get those great every time . The problem with the movie  t the lack of but the fact that it  s just rather dull . The stilted speaking style is sort of interesting but also a bit annoying and the story never me . and are both quite good and there are a couple of effective of suspense , but for the most part the movie is so measured as to feel static . I think much of the problem is his to make the audience forgive him for any film - making .  t a great movie , and without the surprising finale I would have away disappointed , but because it had a strong pay off it made everything alright . If run out of clever then he is going to have to work on making his pay off not with a stunning denouement but with engaging and engrossing film making throughout . Hopefully he  learn to do that , and won  t even need the clever that have endeared him to me .",1
"This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen . Had it not been for Furlong of Terminator fame , this would have been impossible to sit through . The acting was thin and the script just too awful to mention . There was a lack of cohesion right from the start . The obviously had said everything that they to say in about 10 and the rest was a time filler . The special effects department were a little short of money , so was unbelievably cheesy . I hoped that there might have been some interesting once put on the crow , but no . He on to make the best of a bad situation thankfully . I  m struggling to think of one good thing to say about this film but really the only thing I can come up with is my recommendation which is this :- Please DON  T BOTHER . Find something serious , or funny , or maybe even corny , just don  t get this one ..... it  s bad . This was a waste of money .",0
"I realize right off the bat that my 10 mark a bit to high . I admit it , this movie should really be something like an eight , but I have a specific marking style . You see , every film I see with a 10 . If while I  m seeing it I can come up with something I would have done to make it better if I were making it then I take off a point . So , I say ,  I would have had better character development , there goes one point out the window for the film . If I can  t think of a way that the film can be then it  s kind of dumb if I start taking off . Even if I  t like the film , there is no way they could have made it any better . With this film I can  t honestly come up with a way to improve it so it a 10 . Also , I really it , so that  s always a plus . ;) Once again Mac himself in a pretty series / drama film , but this time , unlike with the film . 3000 , there is a lot of comedy . Now , remember this film is trying to be a drama above all , so even though there is a lot of comedy and you will chuckle quite a bit from time to time it never really the you laughing your head off level so it can keep itself as the series film it needs to be . Now , that  t to say there  t a lot of over the top . There  s of them . But , I found that most of the time they were down and even though they were a bit out there they were still understandable . So , this is not the film you will see , but it  s cute and it also something else going for it . Yes , this is yet another remake . Maybe before you sit down to see this film you should try to brain wash yourself into thinking that this film is the first of its kind . I think it  s more enjoyable that way . We  re all a bit sick of the . Well , anyways , the plot is this , Green ( ) just quit his job and is now meeting with ( Mac ) his soon to be father in law . is a bigot , and of it . Needles to say he is not with being white , and not only that , but he soon into the fact that is lying about something , namely him his job , and his quest to expose for the fraud that he is . We  all seen before where they turn racial into a joke . Well , this is the other thing that the film going for it . You see , with most of those other they over do and make it seem that everyone in a specific race rap and hip hop . Well , this just  t true . This movie does not make fun of the that are being by racism . It does not turn them into the but of the joke by them use countless hip hop and trying to be cool . It fun of racism itself . The insult becomes the but of the joke in this film and I  t be happier .  t come off as the white stereotype and  t come off as the black stereotype . They come off as regular . In fact even me of my dad at times . So the film is realistic in this sense and quite enjoyable in this sense to . Also , the film kind of it like it is , but it  s a heart filled drama / comedy so it will never bring you down . that it out to be true is that love  t perfect and there is no happy ending , life is just on going , and there will always be racism and that we are just going to have to deal with it , like it or not . These are very true and well in the film . All you can do is kind of nod in agreement and then smile at the fact that the film still off the happier side of life . It  s true that and play the same character they always do , so you  t really want to call them very good , but hey , they are enjoyable and likable . They make the film . Well anyways , it had heart and was very enjoyable , so ya , a 10 well .",0

"I was a bit hesitant about watching OPEN WATER at first . Although I the lo - fi production and sheer realism of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT , I must confess that they are not the type of I  m used to see . The hand camera , the  documentary  feel , the  I could have done this myself  , I went through all of that but ultimately OPEN WATER and applaud the film for making an entertaining 83 . Although the movie was shot on a hand - , this is NOWHERE as shaky as BLAIR WITCH , or by that , as like IRREVERSIBLE that off as a complete unwatchable blur . Instead we see a movie that could have been shot by you or I , given some shooting background . OPEN WATER is the story of a couple who a trip down to the , away from their daily grind . The two enroll in a diving trip to a coral reef near the coast . During the trip , by some rather unconvincing error , they are left behind by the rest of the diving team and now have to manage to survive in a sea with , , jelly fish and other . The acting is very believable as you hear the belch forth the kind of YOU or I would say if something like this to us .

Will they get eaten by ? Does these happen often ??? It  s when you ask yourself what would you do in their position that the movie really into the viewer . : if you  re a fancy , kind of thriller , stay away from this ; you will PROBABLY not like it and the action during the first half is rather slow .

"On one hand the film is full of inexplicably dumb , which should make a decent viewer loose any interest in it , but on the other there are , which are so great , that the movie immediately itself . So let  s see ... First of all I tell , that ( and it is quite a common of modern horror ) the only relatively smart character is the black guy . Blake , pretty well by by the way , had made numerous sane , which , if they had been accepted by this bunch of white teens , could have saved their . But unfortunately the whites in the film , except for the , who are pretty witty , are actually one than another . The are so dumb , that it somewhat the credibility of the movie .

I mean , if I hypothetically invite a stranger to my home supposedly to help him , but what the stranger does is through my personal , then will I get mad , even if I am not a crazed maniac ?

"Since I live in , I  t even aware that this movie had been until my so kindly me to then discover all this negative criticism . So I decide to BUY the movie and see it for myself if it actually could be THAT bad . To then discover that it  s like any other Video Game movie . Resident Evil and the follower Resident Evil : Apocalypse is video game based that an actress who her career as a model . Now , Tara actually worked within . I  m not saying that it her a better actor , but please , she is better then who Buffy - the big blonde vampire slayer . They even made a follow up and out of Buffy . Who to see a follow up on her demonic Angel who can be with Diesel  s so  acting . None of them can act . Angel probably even better then Diesel and guess what those two in common ! Bad acting and good ! So what if we would see a follow up on ? Alone with ? Or Alone with : 2 ? My point is exactly that no one about acting in an  all action  movie or series ! They want to see and good - looking that some bad / in a amazing way ! So there are a few in the story , but this movie should have been a longer movie with more background . Other from that , I can  t see what there is to complain about . All in all , who can make a Game better then this or then Resident Evil ? I doubt anyone could do this movie better when it comes to effects and or . All that is , is someone who could have directed them more . Because to blame the actor to be bad is easy , but this is not one of those where they lack in talent . This is a movie where the one to blame is Boll , because he should have used the and the actress to give their full ambition in this movie . So , if any of you out there , is so sure that this movie is bad , I would like to know how you ever could get a Video Game movie as the . Because I am sure that no one can make a video game movie as good as the video game . So all I can see is a lack of and story . Other from that , this movie is completely action ! And that what was I . Because that  s what video is about , right ? And I believe Tara better then that character on your video game . So unless your character in the game can give such a pretty face as Tara can then you have nothing on the Alone in the Dark - movie . If you  t want anyone to put a face on your , then you should keep yourself to the video game and not the movie . In which , I doubt you would even play the game if it  t contain action . It  s an action movie . What did you expect ? What Boll did , was to make the game into a action movie . A > action < movie . I want to point out that the action movie special effects , and a lot of and > action <. So if you  t know , a video game being all action and being made into all action can  t be as bad as everyone out . I like it . Why ? Because I bought an action movie and got an action movie . If there were one movie that was the biggest joke in the universe it would be  Boa . Python  and not at all  Alone in the dark .",0

"I  read about this film ranging from excellent to downright vomit . I  read one comment where someone said that if you actually this film , you obviously don  t care for quality . I  d argue to the contrary . In the beginning we witness a variety of freak weather ranging from in , in China and massive in . By the end , we find the world undergoing a new ice age . A little rash ? Of course . But what those who think enjoying this film we don  t care , how about understanding some of us simply enjoy cheesy disaster . I like an excellent , though provoking flick as much as the next person but sometimes , watching something so overly dramatic and impossible in real life that escape that we need . I personally this film . Through decent acting , a love story brought on by fear of rejection and trying to triumph against all odds and the fight for survival bring about a human element much into today  s story . It  t need to be real . Why make seem real ? Where  s the point ? Day After Tomorrow in all it  s world glory is entertainment . Nothing more ... nothing less .

"Nobody can deny that had a tremendous impact , not just on but over the whole world and to film a of him could never be boring . Another matter is to watch it and I must say that even though the movie does have stunning and you can tell that everything in the flying was well , it does leave you rather unfulfilled at the end . The trouble , as it usually does with the of the . does well in the opening and in one particular scene ( the premiere of Hell  s ) he just about every aspect of his character which unfortunately will be through the rest of the movie . Like another of  s , De , he is pretty much let loose to bring out every emotion that he in order to make the character a human being , rather than a stereotype . The supporting cast are not so lucky and I must say that even though Cate is very good indeed as , she hardly deserved the for her performance here . Her one great moment is when she and her family and they play a game of one - up - man - ship but that is more a collaborative effort . Another supporting actor nominee , Alan , is serviceable as the slimy senator on the take from Alec . His scene with at the hotel lunch meeting is some of the best acting he ever done , despite the fact that it is rather superfluous because it is merely a set up for the big Senate hearing . The third actor worth is C . who is in nearly every major film today . Here he to play a normal character for once but he is terribly wasted . We don  t feel that he is all that important neither to or the film . So to repeat what I said : The story of is fascinating but like so many it is not completely up to par with the real story . I think the opening caption on this film it all :  Based on a true story  and not  The full story .",1

I saw it in no less than 8 times . CITY OF was a shallow , attempt to cash in on the success of the first film . In some ways , almost - off the original , but in a way that me loathe the film . Very disappointing ! SALVATION , the third in the series was ... I can  t even remember . I saw it once , and do not remember being by it or feeling anything for it . And now , 2005 back the return of The Crow with WICKED PRAYER . Unlike the first three , this one place in the desert , near an reservation . I must admit , I was with the cinematography on this film . The desert , the , all were well done and great . So ... what do I think of the film ? The direction ? The acting ? For the direction of this film was all too often sloppy . It , more times than not , the film was confused with where it to go . The stuck into , with little to no direction , and carried with no skill . Each set up and felt under - and . Furlong is by NO stretch of my imagination an acceptable Crow ! Looking too much like a gay , instead of a vengeful angel set to make the wrong right . His costume to steal too much from the original . I felt his performance was bland and tasteless . There was no emotion displayed by his character . I did not feel pity or sorry for him , or what to him . I was no convinced that his love was so undying that he could be brought back from the dead . He is no Lee ! I mean , come on :  Quoth the Raven , Nevermore . ** ! What kind of crap writing is that ? is wasted in this film . Though , he not me much with previous such as Carr in VALENTINE , I still feel he is a solid actor and really can pull off the bad guy look . However , in WICKED PRAYER , it never like we are 100 % sure of what he is doing or why . , I get that he is a ritual to become a demon or devil , but where did this come from ? What is in motivation ? World domination ? I don  t think we will ever know . Tara .... Ugh ! And Gray ?!?!? And what was up with Hopper , in what could only be his worst performance . None of the cast is able to save this mess ! Very upsetting to see the series continue to be this way . What out 12 ago with such an inspiring beginning , is to fall further down the spiral of sequel Hell !",1
"The Skeleton Key  is a far better movie than many have given credit for . I was not much , which does admittedly help , but I was rather by the tension . It many to of other in the spooky house genre , but to stride over and above , and actually the situation appear fresh . With a good combination of spooky horror and tension , it does hold the attention all the way through , and it does have a genuinely original ending . It me of  The  which I  t generally like , although that also had a good conclusion . 7 out of 10 . Hurt weight to his mute character , but it is who you , much as did so well in  What Beneath . I have not always her , possibly because she  t look much like her Mother (!) but , with age , ( all of 25 ?) she now a lot of her Mum  s charm and cuteness . There is one scene , near the end , when I actually found myself saying :  Get out , Goldie ! She had me for a second . And anyway , anyone who like Goldie is always going to get my vote . Forget the negative . This movie is a good popcorn - dropping chiller .",1

"Right , let me tell you that I  t enjoy watching this movie one bit . That said , I have to be fair and admit that this movie perhaps could find its audience . It  s suspenseful enough to keep you wishing to get to the end and find out what  s going on . The cinematography is extremely expressive correctly the movie message . Bale is truly unbelievable in what he done for this role . ( By the way , the way he in the movie is NOT for the weak - hearted .) The dialogue is pretty decent , and the have been well . Overall , the movie is definitely unique . But a word of advice to anyone looking for a lighter fare : this movie is not for you . If you don  t feel disturbed , you will be by the end .",0
"When The Notebook first came out in , I thought to myself , great another mushy - gushy film . But when my friend and I decided to see a movie , there was little selection . So after a lot , I in and went and saw the movie . As the came on , I kept thinking that I should run out of the . When the movie was over I  t believe how extraordinary and moving the performance was . As the summer to an end , my and I all got together for our usual back to school meeting just to make sure we  t buy the same clothes . During our usual meeting , 6 out of my 7 had seen it and absolutely it ( the other one had been at camp so she  t have a chance to see any .) We all decided to go see it again and came out of the crying even though we had all seen it before . After that movie came out , I cant imagine a movie even being as close to perfect as this one was .",1
"When i into this film i had all of the and so  nirvana  and stuck in my head . But as the rolled for the , i to remember that Van sant is a director who you either hate or love . Understand or confused by . Just as the film i forgot all those and for an hour an a half , i was somewhere else . i i . The entire film , is character development . It  t take dialogue to understand a person or a group of people . Watch them long enough . Watch them interact with long enough and you  see what kind of person they are . Blake is an old man stuck in a younger body . You  see as you watch him that he ahead of everyone else . His mind already on another issue as the slow down behind him . Which sadly to his end . really his directorial much better in this one than any of his other . I really felt apart of this film , right up until the death scene . forget all the nirvana that say would have this film . Forget all the controversial . just remember this is a film , a piece of art . and i must say i  never seen a death scene done with such class . a very spiritual film with an message if you can find it . 10 / 10 . one of the best I  seen in many .",0
"This is a horror movie . There  s gore here , there and everywhere . There are almost unidimensional ... But I like it . Once you have seen the first gore scene , you  re distressed for the whole rest of the time . The music is at times perfect for the scene , raising the anguish you feel to the top . I had a bad time while and finally watching the gore , but in the I felt better . Something like what you feel when you leave a roller - coaster . Ah , and the final are pretty original . I recommend you not to miss it , but if you don  t stand realistic and explicit gore , then you  d better avoid it .",0
"First of I have to give Jet Li some respect for his performance in this movie . We all know that he can fight real good , but in this movie he actually does some acting . In a very funny and convincing manner he goes from a bloodthirsty beast to a cute  puppy . The plot is that  s ( Jet Li ) mother by a man who is some kind of minor boss when is a small child . He then is raised and trained just like a dog by the same man that his mother . So , when is all grown up he do to all the dirty work , like beating people half to death . Well , one day to see a little of the real world outside his cage without to hurt someone at the same time . This his life forever ... and so on . I have to say that even though Jet Li does a great performance in both martial and acting the movie a little bit overdone . There are of the movie that to unreal and that the movie just a little bit . For example , Morgan Freeman is supposed to play a blind man in this movie and even though he cant see he always at the person he to and his head just like someone that can see does . So that  t very convincing . Still , it is worth to see this one . One of Jet Li  s better .",1
"I admit I only saw about the first 45 ; I just could not stand any more ; this film was excruciating to watch . Worse by far than the nasty  Adaptation . Probably second only to  Sweetie , another film billed as a comedy . How could , after her terrific performance in  Iris , have on for this trash ? Did the set out to induce headache and nausea ? The story , the lighting , the camera - work , the -- they really made me seasick . And it  s hard to care about who don  t like themselves enough to engage in basic . What in the world was romantic about this story of abuse , alcoholism , relationship addiction , and depravity ? There was no compassion for the obvious sickness of the . , , . I wish I could erase the memory of this piece of pretentious , stomach - turning nonsense from my aching head .",0
"I  t expect  Last Days  to be anything like Van Sant  s  Good Will Hunting , and I knew that  s last days were spent doing nothing , but I  t really expect that a movie would be made about a guy doing nothing . But , a las , there was . The fact that the of the were was . There is no chance of   by making an unauthorized biographical account of a deceased person , so why did Van Sant do it ? The long , locked - off of  Blake  walking around just felt so and arrogant . Who else , but Van Sant , would be to shoot in such a way ? However , I preferred it over Bay  s style off shooting in  The Island . But that movie was bad , too . While the movie did make me think , it also made me sleepy . I appreciate a break from the normal , , but I also like a good story . There was no story here . It was a look at a few days in the life of a depressed person with a heroin addiction -- If it were not based on a celebrity , it would have been no less interesting .",0
"I went today to see this film without any and I it . All I can say is that it  s worth the time spent to watch it . Of course , everything in this movie is average , but not bad . The atmosphere of the house and people the truth until the end are similar to the in  s The . And the ending was really unexpected for me . There  s not much more for me to say about this movie , except that it  s worth to spend the evening on it . P .

"I this movie , all 111 of it . While I have to admit , most teens really don  t act like this at thirteen , I still believe that a lot of the plot true . While as a teen , you may not experience this kind of extreme  bad behavior , you will most likely be exposed to it . The smoking and drinking is not unusual , but the , and of sex and drug use is not realistic to that age . Most teens don  t start doing hard until they are older .

This movie does have strong language , sexual , and drug use .

I fear in wide release it will have many more who walk out in disgust and there will be and on the Fox Propaganda Channel . And get ready to see Bob in a whole new light . He is in the film being particularly disgusting and the director was what was up with Bob . . by saying Bob is one of the in the business and related a story about his making a joke about his daughter that is too disgusting to be repeated here .

"First off I  d like to say that if I had to honestly rate this movie from a 1 to a 10 , then I  d give it a - 4 . It  s not that I  m a tough critic , it  s just that this movie is THAT bad . Everything from the story , to the , to the is awful . The story is not even halfway decent to begin with ( you can  t expect much since it is based on a video game , something I was not aware of going into the movie ) but the and made it even worse . The movie at awkward and goes to that are completely unrelated to the previous ; some , like a quick sex scene in the middle , don  t even make sense being put into the story seeing as how the don  t show any toward each other . You could go into this movie to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you  d still be disappointed . Honestly , if you pay to watch this movie then you are wasting your money , and if you don  t pay anything then you are still wasting an hour and a half of your life . So do yourself a favor and don  t watch it .",1

"I genuinely like war and military - and , but this series , at least based on the first episode , is very weak and forgettable . The first episode , just like the first ten of a movie , are crucial to setting up the main plot ( s ) and the . We really get neither here . We  re shown a montage of very forgettable as they prepare to leave for and then are smack in the middle of major combat activity . We don  t know where exactly and we don  t really know why . We  t told what division these are in or what their primary duty is in . Are these and two motor transport female infantry , will they be providing security , or what . I  never been in the military but I would suppose that are assigned to some sort of specific function but we  no idea what that is here . During the combat , which goes on interminably , we have to endure each character telling us about their silly ; ? ? Scream ? Dim ?? Perhaps the thought colorful would make the bland and stand out more . They don  t . After 40 of combat we catch the squad hanging out , just enough time to have a black soldier break into song . Really . Then we  re back on the road and they run over a mine and some guy  s leg get blown off and I  t care one iota . I  t even tell exactly who it was who got . Bo ? Dim ?

Even if it  s an kind of movie with a more childish script , I can  t say this is a bad product . First of all people can know more about an almost unknown country as Mali ( even if now is a democracy and the picture us as a dictatorship ), secondly it as an energetic continent but forgotten by the World and lastly it  s an environmental and not shallow movie all insert in a package of an action pop corn movie .

"2001 - A space , one of the very few spectacular ever made , certainly a film most would never have thought was made in the 1960  s , it  s visual , far forward special effects , make this film excellent throughout . I must admit , when I was a lot younger I did think the beginning of the film was too slow burning and accused it of being boring , but I have eaten those and know better , especially with the poor trash that is being out of nowadays .

"2001 is the supreme example of the lost art of pure cinema . Alongside other like Lean , a period of epic film - making that sadly from our realm . The indelible experience of a theatrical motion picture event such as 2001 been in our time with forgettable multiplex fodder -- even  event  such as  s War of the are nothing more than forgettable popcorn time - . But 2001 was to leave a lasting impression of complex , majestic artistry , sewing of mystery and dream - world surrealism that , for me at least , live on in my own consciousness . Those who  never 2001 in its proper setting have never really seen the whole film . I have the , but rarely enjoy it . The home video format simply the grandeur and majestic scope of this completely unique cinematic milestone . The last chance I had to view it on a big screen was at the in about a decade ago , and that experience was memorable beyond . Inherent in its , 2001 was meant to be in crystal - clear 70mm on a mammoth screen , with state - of - the - art sound . Through its sensory scope , the technology of the film itself the evolutionary between the futuristic and the very medium chosen to portray him / it . The movie screen becomes a character in the by 2001 , and no video system can ever duplicate that . The incredibly complex , layered sound ( as well as the suffocating silence ) is also a character . That  s the nature of  s visionary cinema . Such were the and of film - making as it blossomed in the era , conceptual which are all but lost in our current corporation - saturated world . It was after seen 2001 as a young that I was able to see  s complete body of work , and it  s still striking that an artist who was so cynical could have made the great masterpiece of awe and wonder . The companion piece to 2001 , A Clockwork Orange , is in many ways the antithesis of all that 2001 , and to me that  s a fascinating dichotomy . I think the latter film was closer to  s own world - view , but as an artist and a master of , 2001 as the supreme testament to thinking outside the box .",1

To that magical , mystical land that all of us have of one day finding . This movie is not at all a remake of the same old story of the boy who never grow up . No , this is a story about how that story came to be . In a wonderful fashion Finding Neverland you on that journey , and you don  t even know that your going , but by some magic you a away into that world of endless of your youth .

"Not only is this movie not true to the , which is forgivable , it is a horrible film technically as well .

This goal is admirable and in and of itself is a fine task . It would be like writing the Passion of the through  - different and intriguing .

"It a great ending , completely unpredictable . It is very twisted that someone actually thought this up , very original ; commendable ... or committable . It me of Se7en , though not as good . Se7en a lot more research involved , in keeping with the whole deadly ; , Brad and Morgan Freeman are beyond . Saw is completely original , however based solidly on the concept of apathy and lack of respect for their own . The here past mustard and the story is what the film , but being second to Se7en is still excellent . death keep you interested and prevent the usual boredom and monotony that accompany like theses . place mostly in two or three , but it  t diminish it in anyway . Cinematography the mood to tee , that is deranged , twisted , psychotic , panic and primal . Anyway , very , all story and no fluff .",1
"I was to see on the case that  Sideways  won 3 major film and even saying it is  The film of the year  and  Unmissable . For me ,  Sideways  was a struggle to watch and three quarters of the way through I gave up . ( to anyone who watched it all the way through , where it apparently picked up , according to my Dad ) The  film of the year  certainly  t live up to its praise , I hardly at all and when there was any humour , it was hardly side - splitting . For example , Jack down a steep hillside with amusing music in the background : award - winning comedy ? The boring where we a silent Jack and driving through the vineyard - full countryside are completely pointless , even split -  t liven boring of and wildlife . There  t seem any attempt at making wine interesting to anyone who knew nothing about it , which was odd because it the main feature of the film . about washed over me completely . Even though the acting to be good , it still  t endear me to these two awful . Jack is foul - mouthed , arrogant and a cheat , whilst is a slightly creepy , wine lover who his time writing rubbish and from his mother . If you do decide to watch this film , make sure you have a good book or your I - Pod with you .",1
"I  m more of fan of than Bill , but I think his performance in Broken is the highlight of the movie . His ubiquitous deadpan never carried so much weight as in this role as the aging Don character , Don . A strong rebuff to those that thought Lost in Translation was his one - of - a - kind - role - of - a - lifetime . Broken is a film that with the best of his work ( Down By Law , Mystery Train , Dead Man , Ghost Dog ) - that entertain and provoke thought in equal measure , that keep the sense of vision without sacrificing accessibility . I was disappointed by Coffee and , but this film my faith in . . It  s especially good to see him a format which of anthology but stays together as a single story , albeit one which ultimately character study over a perfectly sewn - up plot . Some may be by the inconclusiveness of the ending . I don  t think the film could end any other way and remain true to the character , the tone , or the vision . It  s a little downbeat from start to finish , and you either buy it or you don  t . I bought it . Wright was very funny and warm , Stone trailer trash perfectly , fine by ( as an  animal communicator ), , , and ( cast against type as a chick .) Plus as the to end all , whom I would gladly see more of ( in a manner of speaking ).",0

"I know that a lot of people have spent a lot of time writing wonderful of this film that really describe in vivid detail how awful this movie truly is . I to do the same thing , but after watching this film , I went to my doctor and he told me that I was now mildly retarded . He  t know I had seen this movie the night before , so he ran a bunch of and kept saying  I just don  t get it ... over and over , but that is a story for a different time . All I can say is that whatever this movie is supposed to be , it  t . Was it supposed to be scary / suspenseful ? Maybe , if your idea of scary / suspenseful is coming downstairs as a little on morning to see if you got a brand new bike , and instead you find your father naked and he strawberry jelly in your face and you in your .

"Over There real , real , and real . The writing is over the top and the photography you a sense of being there . The main are all interesting , the action are well done and well , and when the shooting , all hell loose . I sat on the edge of my seat for the full hour . If this is what Channel in mind for us , it won  t be long before they bury the competition with quality like this . They  already begun with like The Shield and Rescue Me , and now Over There . Absolutely stunning ! Over There is theatrical quality , and great theatrical quality at that . This one my highest recommendation !",1

"God , I had to force myself to watch through this waste of time . Two or three decent don  t justify a 90 minute movie . South Park was huge fun . But this is offensive stuff . War are , a socialist terrorist . And in the end moronic ho are the who save the day . A propaganda piece disguised as satire . Dim . To be fair it some nice puppetry and some great , but in the end it just  t make up for a very weak and inconsistent script . Avoid at all cost . What a opportunity",0
"Open Water  t a bad film , but neither is it a good one . It is in a  Blair Witch  or  home video  style which can get a little annoying . It a married couple , and , on their who decide to go on an diving excursion . While out at sea , other of the party return to the boat ready to go back to shore . There is a miscount and times get mixed up and so the boat to shore leaving and in the middle of the sea of which they are unaware . It does make you think about how daunting that would be and is sure to put off some from going on such on their . I guess this is where the story because as you may guess a shark is sure to come and eat them - I mean there  s 2  of meat  bobbing up and down in shark water what else could happen . What get  s a little tedious is that every so often or get bitten but it  s not enough to leave you on the edge of your seat , especially when it 4 or 5 times . You horribly start a shark will come and swallow them whole instead of taking small and keeping the film going on and on with nothing but that . A part of you also them to get - basically something different than just floating in the middle of the sea . Unfortunately the film  t get exciting . It  s quite unclear what to - his body up I guess after being at a few times and he off leaving . She suddenly is taken underwater in a slightly dramatic but boring ending . This film is . I can see how it would appeal to a certain audience - those who are not of the usual blockbuster . The film can get slightly boring and could  done with a little more dialogue but not all bad .",0
"Always skeptical of Mark  s acting , I when to this preview screening . I was , however , gratefully that he  t his usual pretty - boy - - for - tough - guy role . More impressive was the fact that the plot line and dialogue were so believable . I could venture a guess that most people will not appreciate the graphic violence of this film but I can tell you that it is necessary to make the overall experience of the movie believable . There is nothing miraculous about this movie and no are terribly difficult to discern . If you were ever curious about the reaction would have to the murder of a parent , you can pretty much see it out in this film . to the studio , this one is a good watch !",0
"City of God  director , , does NOT disappoint with his film translation of the novel  The Constant Gardener . His treatment of the violence is on par with  COG .

Yes , they are terrible , but you really don  t want to look away . Unfortunately , I have not read the novel ; therefore I cannot draw ( this situation will be next week ). Major kudos to Ralph for choosing as director and to , Pete , , Bill , , for a job well done \u0096 they  re a fabulous cast .

"I was really with this movie . Going in to the sneak preview , knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I  d seen , I thought it was going to be a Dude Where  s My Car kind of crap fest . I was bad sex and and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that  s just how work . Instead I got a smart , surprisingly original movie about a decent , average guy who just never had sex . Yes , the film is chock full o  sex and vulgarity and the occasional hey - look - a - nipple !, but it  s done much in the spirit of Bad rather than Sorority . All the are people you probably know in real life , redeemable who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their . I went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap , and I was very . Yea , it  s pretty over the top ( c  mon , it  s a movie about a 40 year old virgin !), but it  s very smartly done . In the end , you  re really for this guy to get laid , which a lot about the movie because honestly , did you really care if found his car or not ?",1
"Just came out of a sneak preview for this film . It had me laughing every 30 . The ending was so funny that were rolling down my face and it had me wishing I  t bought that large coke . There are definitely some , but , overall , highly entertaining . The movie have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both in  Almighty  and Will  : The Legend of  in their . Rudd is hilarious as always . I love that he can be so funny in these broad and to work in ( like P . S .). I think that Seth should be getting more work , because he so talented and engaging . also had some incredibly funny . I highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac . However , if you  re easily offended , don  t see this movie . If you  re a rabid feminist , don  t see this movie . And , please , not matter what , even if you think you  re one of those  hip  , don  t take your to this movie . Sure , you should let your teens go see this movie , just don  t watch it with them . It would make for some incredibly awkward .",1
"I saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight . I absolutely it . The movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night . Murphy is extremely creepy as the villain . For those of you who have seen Batman , his character was much in this film . He his character very well . The  bad guy , I have seen in awhile . was great . Everyone in the audience , and cheered at the same time , as if we were on cue . The suspense is through out the movie . THe amazing part is that the end was not anti - climatic . I was not disappointed in the end . I felt satisfied . The trailer does not do the movie justice . The movie is much better than the trailer . Do not wait for this movie to come out on video . Go see it . Although , I did not have to pay to see this movie , I would have gladly given 10 . 75 to see it . Enjoy !",1
"in , I thought that this might be a pretty good series . Why not ? generally great . But this one is totally gay . First off , there are no - 1 ( ) used for in . What about a two day fire fight without resupply , or support assets ? Get real ! Sure we still don  t have armor on all of our , but  t that up ! And what  s with the allusion to the  Hero  Lynch with the / transportation ? What a crock ! Now I understand that to embellish a bit to get the story line going , but honestly keep the political correctness out of it and keep it realistic . I do have to give MAJOR kudos to the scene where after just the first week the soldier  s wife is banging another man . Also to showing great carnage of the  s . I so hard during all of those . It was just the premiere , so hopefully the will do a better job of getting the right . I  definitely continue to watch .",1
"I saw the majority of the 1st episode and thought it was a good story line . Some of the between the a little stereotypical of  Army talk . As a veteran I am watching with an eye of scrutiny more so than the average . Some were the female wearing lipstick which is an Army no no especially in a field environment . A helicopter in episode 1 was a UH1 model which may be possible but not likely since the model been in use since the mid 80  s . Some of the background scenery oh so , which as it turns out is . My biggest concern is the message that this show will be . We have enough crap coming from the news that are painting our men and as ugly . We don  t need a show to reinforce the and the negativity of our mission . Agree with it or not our are doing their mission and not for approval . I hope the of this show keep it real without some political agenda . If week after week turns out to be gloom and doom with depressing of  how bad it all is .. Over There .. dump this show from your schedule . Great presentation , good music and story flow so far .",1
"Last Days  may have to be considered on two . As a film that pointedly it is based on the life of a famous rocker , it can be at on its own , without outside or plot similarity . But the film is to , most of the plot are taken from what is known about his last days , lead actor  s hair , body look , use of language and music are so eerily evocative of that it is difficult to not see it as a sort of concentrated pic or  J  Accuse  of who or what him . So if I were unaware of the back story , the film to be a heartbreaking look at the of mental illness , by and , as  Blake  and like the muttering who scatter around , by his plastic wristband from a  clinic , and though we never actually see the drug to easily blame his behavior on addiction .  s sensitive sound design is an equal partner with  s performance in  Blake  s mental state as almost auditory of ( much more subtle than in a  A Beautiful Mind ). We see him first as prelapsarian figure , all his in the clear air , water and fire of a , until the modern world with the symbolically redolent of an airplane , train and church , calling him to fulfill his physical . Dressing up in ranging from a slip to a complete with rifle , he actively most human contact and is pretty much only lucid when writing or singing or music . His final are ambiguous but beautifully , a highlight of  crisp and lovely cinematography . The second theme is its chilling look at the issue of human responsibility as everyone around  Blake  something from him and is oblivious to his fragility in their selfishness . He is by a Yellow Book salesman incongruously him on his success over the past year , his angry tour manager , a guest for help ( an excellent with owl - like glasses ); a possibly Kim nagging him about his daughter ; talky sent by  Blackie , possibly his wife who we only hear yelling on the phone , to hunt him down ; and he just to avoid two Mormon . His house are and bed hoppers just looking to avoid any or , even if they are probably stoned , possibly by their grooving to a Velvet Underground song , and one to just disappear . from different , as writer / director Van Sant did in  Elephant , just them seem even more culpable in their neglect . With real world , there  s amusing irony when  Blake  turns on the and a Men romantic video , perhaps how absurd it was that  Like Teen Spirit  an staple . doing his own acoustically  s  unplugged  take on  s  Where Did You Sleep Last Night . At the very least , one certainly the of the anguish that produced  s tortured music and suicide . If this is a tribute to , it is a sadly sympathetic one .",0

"My wife thought she the film . Then she her mind after talking to me . I was absolutely out of my mind . I haven  t the idea what people got out of this movie , or why it is in the top 250 ??? Being a huge film buff and watching everything from action and comedy , to dramatic , foreign and independent , covering almost every decade of the last century , I feel like I have seen enough to know what a great movie : if I can watch a film over and over again and always experience the same level of enjoyment ( I call it ), superb acting , unique or solid story line , script with crisp and witty , and if the film sparks any emotion inside of me at all . I feel like are now being by in order to help their industry , especially when rating like this so highly . The highest bidder The best critic ( hint : he glasses ) or a major critic , 2nd place a major paper , third a critic , . If you can pay the minimum $ 20 , 000 , you can get an magazine or radio show to give you a stellar review ( watch a commercial for a film that  s about to be and see how many radio and give these great . Sometimes they use 2 - 3 from the same critic ). Due to the gross amount of I regret wasting my time watching lately because of the rave are giving terrible , I  d rather take  s opinion than modern day . Whatever  s happening , its definitely convinced our movie going society and the Academy  s to lower its dramatically ( not in most , but in the last few , you have to agree that some people who took home have been so undeserving ), and it me to no end . I can  t find a single reason why I would want to watch this film again . , there were some funny , like waking up after the party and seeing a fully dressed knight , or shooting straight into the air with your rich friend who can  t furnish a house to save his life . But I  t interested in the main story at . The acting was completely of passion and felt forced . I think Portman is the most actress in . A darling , beautiful , talented woman , but she  t made too many good since aka the Professional . And wow ! Talk about Method Man  s cameo ! Academy award winning stuff right there ! I  m glad his show on Fox is doing well . And Holm turns in what could be the only performance where his main motivation must have been  act boring . And the director , writer and star should stick to just acting . His  vision  was clouded and it to be a - typical , nothing out of the ordinary or exciting . I  t feel anything for any of the ( except for maybe the hamster or guinea pig that ). Could someone please explain to me why you thought the film was so spectacular ? Or let me suggest this , try watching this film and like it without . Sound like an idea ?",0

"The show within itself is not bad , but unfortunately it one major flaw that is so common with military , and that is it does not portray the as people with any intelligence or individuality . The in the show are as ( i  m assuming they are reservist ) that are just plucked up out of their and into a in with no training , no experience , and unable to function without the input of a salty , seasoned Sergeant . I am a Sergeant in the , and I have been  over there , and I also happen to be a reservist . While I have to admit we had our scary times , there was never an air of helplessness , and every one is to be able to think . Everyone a job , we are not just identical that are interchangeable being by some guy that a lot . If I were to treat my like that , they would shoot me . Also , the show some serious tactical as far as the for convoy are concerned and how they are on the . The soldier  s were as naive and ignorant of any of their training or of where they were . For instance , if someone saw someone doing something suspicious on the side of the road , first there  t be a question of  are you sure ? we NEVER question what someone , we investigate everything - even if it may be someone  imagination . Second , why would the truck pull onto the shoulder of the road ? You just saw something there . We NEVER pull onto the shoulder unless we have no choice and if we do pull onto the shoulder , we stop IMMEDIATELY . Third , the people in the back of the truck were just sitting and chatting ... How about some security duty by pointing your weapon outboard and scanning for  s and enemy . Fourth , what was with the - netting on the back of the truck ? we never do that in a hostile environment because that netting can catch a grenade if one is from a bridge . This just scratches the surface . My point is there needs to be a show that accurately a military day to day and . We are in the military , we each know our , we each have unique and , and we a re of that . We are not that are at by some  Sergeant  that  t know our name . One other thing , all had at least 4 .

"This movie is more  tense  then it is really scary and is not to be confused for a shark horror flick ( ie or Deep Blue Sea ). The movie is short , but intense once it going . It more like a documentary - there are a LOT of . I felt like I was watching one of those nature where you see the , suffering and dying but rather than interfere with the course of nature , the suffering is but not ( the cameraman  t help the baby thats lost its but rather it suffer , even perish , on camera for the sake of realism )- that thing . The acting is quite good and the or  flow  is great - happen slow at first - it real , they don  t just get by the second the boat leaves ... there are other too ! The movie not only with the real physical in the ocean , but the mental as well - the horror , panic and stress that slowly over the two . So while the movie  t scary visually , the idea of it is terrifying ! You can  t help but to imagine yourself in that situation - drifting helplessly through the huge expanse of ocean with nothing to do but think ( about hunger , thirst , fatigue , horror , panic , and a possible death by or worse hungry )... well thats just creepy !

The film them , and what they do in order to get - for example , taking a trip to the supermarket . , Harry  s ( by the beautiful ) is a drug addict who with a couple of men to get money , but whose talent is sketching . When Harry to save up enough cash in order to buy a place so can set up a store , it nothing will go wrong . But after Tyrone put in jail , Harry all the saved money to bail him out . When failing to find any to buy , Harry and Tyrone go to - or was that (!) in order to buy . In the meanwhile we also see how degraded herself to stripping in front of of men , a dildo with another woman . It with Harry being taken to hospital , after we see how turned Harry  s arm into a horrible sight ... Tyrone is taken to jail and all dignity . We witness the various drug - related in their . , and ALL play amazingly well , with excellent , convincing . The stylish use of the split - screen technique , huge close - and exaggerated sound effects add to the glossiness and the is and unforgettable . I highly recommend this daring , brutal shock - fest for all of those with a strong stomach in search of a powerful and trip into the dependent darkness of modern . A must - see ... cinematic history ...",1
"Wow , the of this film on astound me . Now I  m not one of those hyperactive film , a person who   instead of   or someone who  s trying to work their way in the business . I  m simply a college student who . That being said , I have to say , I absolutely this movie . The story ( which I won  t go into because it  s pretty much everywhere else ) was well written and . Dae - does in fact appear to be quite the afflicted protagonist . It was refreshing to see a character that the audience was supposed to sympathize with not exactly be of the highest ( or even a normal ) moral character . The psychology of all the in the film dead on to me . Many a times during the movie I  t help but say  if it  t for my morals I would do the exact same thing . Those who can  t understand why certain do certain need to stop observing and think  if that had to me ... As for the ending ... maybe I just don  t have the negative outlook on life that some on the board have , but I found it very surprising . Not only that , but I went with my roommate and we  re both in the Navy , we  seen some crazy stuff , yet we both were by how twisted it was . It was so surprising that anyone could end a movie in such a up fashion . Well , that  s enough ranting for me ; I just to put my two in for what I felt was a fantastic movie .",0
"I really this movie . I am not a big fan of , but I have to say of to the guy , this was an excellent performance . There to be a lot of talk about the character of as not being likable , and perhaps this is not the best way to make people like the film . I have to disagree , this is a commentary on a major figure in aviation history . What would be the point in making a film about him and him so that he was more likable ? By all he was a man driven incessantly by a desire to succeed , to go one step further in aviation . this about the man completely . Of course as most truly driven people are , he made and some people simply found him too much . He would have not been an easy man to be around , even when his psychological were not affecting him . If the character had been to make him easier to like , then it would not have been a film about . Nevertheless as the film there is clearly a sense of loyalty toward the man from the growing population of people who work for him , he is clearly up to and there is the desire of his and to keep his out of the , to protect him from pressure and harm . Even though he may not have been the easiest man to like , it is clear that he was by a great many people . Cate was just perfect as as was as Ava Gardener , and the insight into 1920 - 40 was interesting . In my opinion , Alec had the character although I would not go so far as to say he did a bad job of the bad guy of Pan . Alan ( as always ) provided a much better  bad guy  though in the form of the Senator whose  witch hunt  enquiry was torn apart by a determined . I quite enjoy long , but this is longer than most . There are not many this long that I would want to watch many times , but I think I will be watching this again soon as I was engrossed in the story from beginning to end . It  s a shame that film is only concerned with life up till the maiden ( and only ) flight of the , but if his whole life had been handled then in my opinion it would have a very rushed and crowded film . .",0
"This Harry Potter was really good . I watching it and the plot was just as interesting as the first two . It the book and it was very well put together . But this movie was different from the first two . This one felt more ... dark . I think this may be because of the plot , and how disturbing it is to Harry , so I think that is why it  s different from the other two Harry Potter . The acting was a lot more dramatic in this movie . I think the of the story engage this more dramatic acting . I was extremely by all the and seen how they  from the previous . All in all this movie was great . I recommend it to all Harry Potter .",1

"This movie is a relic of the year 2002 , before the had put an irrevocable nail in the coffin of the Matrix franchise by a poor second movie and a really awful third one . The movie so many from the Matrix that it  s difficult to list them all . Furthermore , it mostly them pretty badly , and the budget is obviously about 100 times less than that of the Matrix . A sense of camp goofiness the entire affair , from the overly dramatic lighting , to the standing in neat looking at a giant video screen with a talking head on it , to the high - concept premise itself . In one way it  s like the of early - 21st century science fiction . Nevertheless , the film is fun . It  s mostly saved by the stellar performance of Bale in the lead , who clearly been told ,  , put on this outfit that we stole from Neo in the Matrix . Now act exactly like . Fortunately , Bale is good at doing this , and is generally a better actor than the . The supporting cast all put in some excellent work as well . Probably the most engaging part of the movie is watching them gamely play along and put in serious hard work as the story more and more ridiculous . I was very by their professionalism . Probably my favorite scene a character who at least eight people to save a little puppy ( said puppy to be in some by a rather unconvincing hand puppet ). What a moral statement for the -- along with the timeless message ,  ruthlessly all of art and literature in order to eradicate emotion from humankind ... would be WRONG . entertainment .",1

"To be frank , my and i are debating whether this was in fact the worst movie we have ever seen ( though it is not much of a debate ). We are anyone who was involved with this movie to please , give us our hour and a half back . There was nothing entertaining about this movie , other than a nearly nude Portman , and , there is not nearly enough shown to justify spending any money to view this movie . The movie is only , which is incredibly poor , and never even came close to being dramatic . Any attempt at a plot was simply shot down by a severe lack of realism , and that went no where slowly .

"during the duration of this film I had to pause it 10 times simply for the fact that I felt that I was going insane . This is down the most disturbing and depressing movie i  ever seen . But in a very beautiful and poetic way . Pain can be beautiful because it is human . I absolutely the non compromising attitude this director took with this movie , it never up , never you breathe , you under water and pain into your . If you watch this movie you will be affected . Unless you are seriously out of touch with artistic of expression . I how it affected me , I how sad it made me , because it was real , that was the story , it was sad , If they had all ended up on a beach in at the end I would have felt . I kept turning away , squirming in my seat , holding my over my mouth and biting my lip . At the end came , a constant flow of them , I felt so lost so depressed so pitiful for those . It was just brutally honest . This is what film is for , it is not a cheap , sensationalistic piece of crap that is usually used to bring forth emotion in people . It is completely and totally honest . And If you are fragile emotionally do not watch this film . Although to be honest , I am very fragile , I watched it alone and I found it made me . On a final note I  d like to add that not winning the is one of the biggest of modern film . She this character so brilliantly I had my jaw any time she spoke , during one scene she your heart out about five times and it against the ground . She is so broken so torn . It was absolutely magnificent . I wish I could tell her that she deserved that more than that sappy sell out piece of crap that won instead . anyway , it made me completely uncomfortable and broken but I will appreciate that and adore this movie for the rest of my life , it is truly a beautiful film even for a girl who  s favorite movie is Python and the holy grail .",1

"I really can  t cope . From an antiquary and archaeological point of view , Troy  is the only serious film about ancient I have ever seen .

"This movie is phenomenal . The depth and substance that is in this film you so deep into Middle - Earth , both visually and emotionally , that the viewer cannot help but feel some sense of attachment to this place , as if it had once truly . The most genius moment of the entire trilogy of is the scene  The Finding of the Ring . out as a sort of prologue to The Return of the King , it  s a bold move on Peter  s part that he should start his 3rd movie by telling back - story , rather than re - what already been established in the previous . It not only  s confidence in the continuity of his story and the substance of the character of / , but it also his confidence that the audience will allow him with the structure of the plot , that a  t necessarily have to be into context before it to be fully . One production element of these three that Middle - Earth seem so tangible is Peter  s apprehension towards except where truly necessary . Scale and half - were used in where most director would simply shoot 100 % computer with . And while it  t afford the the absolute freedom and ease that a complete virtual world , the time and effort spent doing is ten - fold on screen . I know it  s , but if you compare to Star in of how special effects were shot , you can see that 100 % would have likely ruined the enchantment of the : The original Star trilogy was shot for effects as there were no rendering in existence during its production . And while would have been nice to smooth over some of the and stop - action , in the end everything very fluid , organic , and real . But once the - were shot , the technology was there to do almost all effects production on . However , continually the technology and the effects ultimately convey very rigid lighting against only semi - realistic and ultimately the subtract from the story because they stand out so substantially .  s effects blend seamlessly into all the other of the movie because they don  t scream  fake  like  s , but rather whisper  this is no less real than your mind will make it . and partial may seem like a step backward in of technology , cost , and time , but it can be that this was one of the many that ultimately gave the their pristine artistic quality . This is only a segment of a much essay that I wrote in the process of writing this review . There is so much more to say about this movie and it  s that could never fit in this context . Just trust me when I say that this is the most impressive , memorable , and ultimately rewarding that I  seen .",1

"I the radio series when I was a . I watched the series first time around and thought it was utterly new and exciting . I collected the original trilogy as soon as they came out in paperback ... brilliant . Then the fourth and fifth came - , but not the genius we  d seen previously . Then the new radio series came along ... like 4 & 5 ; I had to listen religiously , even though they  t great like they used to be . And finally news of the movie going into production at last . Now , since H2G2  t been  fantastic  since the early , I was worried ... very worried . Given the tendency for to screw up  , I was even more worried - so I spent a lot of effort following its progress and trying to convince myself it could be pretty good . Then I read the early on and told myself that while some people said it  t so good , a lot of thought it was well worth it . And then it came to that fateful night when my  s sister and us which movie we  d like to see together ... and I Hitchhiker  s - but they could watch anything else if they . Hitchhiker  s it was ... Oh dear oh dear oh dear . They  re still me for it . To put it bluntly , it  s bad . Very bad . Under the of that evening , it was personally - embarrassing bad .

It no flow whatsoever , either in of story or . happen , you don  t know why . Suddenly something else , but you don  t know why .

I each and every one of them from the radio series  and , but here they are flat , boring and sometimes just annoying ( and ).

Strange , I used to think he was the most outstanding character in the entire !. On a plus point , the visual effects were nice - although I have to say I the book in the series a lot more .( Minor spoiler in this paragraph .) The messing with the story  t improve at all . The missing left gaping and the re - writing turned it all into a  running from the bad  ... which it never was !!! The added were pointless and not very funny . Which us to the real problem ... This film is not funny . Where before there was great wit , there is now tame slapstick ( you  watched the   already if you  seen the trailer !). What were once huge , convoluted , intelligent are now rushed , throwaway links to the next scene . The weird little and that put a smile on your face seem to have taken the day off . Most of the and proper delivery to be missing . It you wonder if the actually understood the humour in the first place !. And quirky humour was basically the point of Hitchhiker  s , was it not ?",1

"I rented this last night , despite the bad . I just to check Fanning  s performance , after being by her in Taken , Man on Fire and of course War of the . Well she is the best thing in Hide & Seek . De is on autopilot , in a part that  t really challenge him . The story is interesting and creepy at first , but unfortunately that  t last ... The twist is just so lame that it the rest of the movie . It up being something you  seen a thousand times before . The last reel is so full of , all you can do is roll your in disgust . On a separate note , it was nice to see Amy ( if only for a few ). She should be seen more often !",1
"I saw this movie shortly after leaving the , where I spent five long staring dubiously at a warped metal cube , trying to extract some meaning , to evoke some feeling or past memory , but i  t have any luck .. I left feeling truly empty . The other half of my summer was spent in movie alternating between summer blockbuster and the bathroom vomiting the butter from the popcorn . .. You can imagine the state as i the theater this evening . i  t know what to expect . I did see a group of looking wearing in the corner of the theater hall . So maybe at one point I to expect something that  t actually turn out the way I it to . At all . The only i can place close to Van Sant at this point is and . If you don  t know who either of these people are , or you do know them and don  t happen to like their , you will probably want to strangle your date for you to this . The one thing they all have in common is , well , for lack of a better word ,  atmosphere . I know that word is tired now and been used to describe this film in countless and , so i  try some that come to mind : , , , mood , taste , tone , space , spirit , sense , semblance , color , environment . FORGET PEOPLE . Last Days  t about people so much as it  s about an empty vessel towards a deep dark black hole somewhere in the center of a self galaxy , to avoid human contact at all . you  re left with a kind of love for something beyond humanity , In Van Sant  s world , are apathetic , distant , unloved and incapable of loving or real , except perhaps anger and depression , but are capable of a sort of redemption . This is immediately a turn off for many people , especially for domestic who  been on melodrama . Long camera , soft focus , careful color modulation , jump , , abstract sound / scape  s , even a climactic double exposure ( in camera ill bet ), every old school trick in the book to water the film who  been waiting so patiently for this movie to arrive , and it finally .. In the ! I  m warn you now if you can  t sit in the forest or on a mountain comfortably for a couple enjoying nature as it is , you probably won  t enjoy this film . One of the most surprising ( and pleasing ) is that the is so sparse , I can  t recall understanding one word the main character , and some times I could hear the voice being to the left or the right speaker , instead of the standard center , making it even harder to comprehend . the are shocking in their simple brilliance and sans the use of Apple computer ( van Sant a he in his house !!!!). And the sound design . Wow , this is one of the best sounding I have ever in my life . a really interesting and creative use of design , and clipping in where there should be none , the sound of water , , fire crackling , ticking in feedback of themselves ringing the hour , and one amazing sequence where Blake a guitar loop on an pedal and along with and into the and that in the loop and his belligerently and then after five of that it all off only the sound of the feedback remain ... it just the whole thing from start to finish ; van Sant a habit of cutting on the crest of a sound like somebody the door to the outside world or turning off the record during the best part - you hear the as deeply as you would the it is just so damn satisfying to see and hear a director experiment like that today . I really thought it was over soon . That we were reaching a point of creative singularity , that it  s all dried up and we have to rely on past and and and art to make more , either that or we  d have to just stop one day . this was something of a spiritual experience , something i feel very rarely , the to construct a shockingly effective film from basically ... Nothing ...",0
"This was a great movie . This was a very well written movie , better than anything that I have seen in quite some time . Never once any attention to the guy in the middle of the floor . As it ended , I  t believe that it was the  dead  guy . Never once thought of him . I have to admit that I thought that it was Zip . But what I don  t understand was this , Zip was the only person that was nice to the guy , making say his name . Why would he hurt him . It also took me all movie to figure out that black cop was Glover . Lots of but a great movie none the less . Ending was very much like Beauty , where you sit there and go  Did I just see that ?",1
"This sequel was a lot better than i was . Of course my were very low . I  t a huge fan of the original Triple X and with a change in the main character i was to see how they fit everything into the theme of the movie . I however was pleasantly . Now this was no  great  movie by any , the plot was thin , the had little depth , and the acting was only adequate . But the action are another story . they were great , they were very well done and definitely unique . The action was really the only portion of this movie that really worked . the ending of th is film fell into the usual trap of setting everything up for another sequel . How sad that can only see dollar and not make good .",1
"I so many negative about this movie , so I thought it was bad . Until ( now ) I saw it for myself it  t that bad at all . It was quite interesting . At least better than The . Yes , the beginning of the movie actually not that interesting and could be quite boring . But this is M . Night movie , he only concentrate on twisted ending ( is that the good thing \u0096 I don  t think so ). What make this movie better than I thought was - there is more than one twist , that what make it interesting . The casting is surprising good , somewhat better than the movie . I say have done a brilliant job of all . Though I was a twisted ending , there are some unexpected and it let you guess , so I say he really did what he in this movie . Recommendation : Yes , Rent It . But Only If You Haven  t About The Twisting From Someone . Rating : 6 . 5 / 10 ( Grade : C +) Please Rate My Review ( Yes or No ) After Reading It - Thanks",1
"I can  t say enough about this movie . I would like to say that Don is not simply the best actor out there , but is one of the best out there period . I would even venture to say he was of the this year . His performance was subtle , and yet had so many different , it is impossible to describe . What did was simply amazing , and to what one person can do , how one person can make a true difference in the world . This man and Don with his amazing performance , truly touched my heart . Kudos also go out to as  s unwaveringly supportive and loving wife , and the the in this movie were also wonderful . This is a movie that to the human spirit and should NOT be .",1
"To be honest , The Grudge , in my opinion is a fantastic film . The way it is written and the and the , everything about it is good . The girl that the actual  grudge ghost  is brilliant . She amazing and does the whole thing really well . From what I can gather , the director is a brilliant director . It  s not really gory and I suppose some people might find it quite scary but I  t . I  m completely by the film and I  become with learning language and doing other stuff . I think maybe kind of it a bit but only slightly . I guess its because every time you see you stereotype her as Buffy and therefore cant imagine seeing her in anything else . All in all its a great movie . No about it . ITS A MUST SEE !!!!!!!!!!",0
"For me , time is valuable and to take time to watch a movie is a big thing . Yet with TITANIC , I would watch it everyday if I could and I would not get tired of it . People protest at its two - day love story , and say that  Captain Smith was a man who , realizing his mistake of the ice - berg warning , personally took on the responsibility of the damages himself . That is true , and though I love the movie , I do wish that they had shown that . ( THE AVIATOR , WHATEVER TO GILBERT GRAPE ?), deserved a nomination for his endearing portrayal of the live - for - the - moment young man Jack . ( ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND , FINDING NEVERLAND ), was the up and coming actress who was chosen for the part of Rose . Her brilliant performance a Best Actress nomination , though it deserved the actual . The second part of the movie ,( Spoiler Warning ), in of which R . M . S . Titanic , is touching , well done , mainly accurate , and very sad . Not only do you cry when the now beloved Jack , but also when Rose ( ), 84 later , after telling her story for the first time . Victor , Fisher , and Billy add notable in this epic love story and tragedy .",1
"Most people need to see the movie twice to like it , and three times to get it . The best part of the movie is the 2 hour conversation afterwards . If you like that make you think about society , politics , religion , science , . then you will love this movie . The reason why this film is so great is that the are not blatantly , everything is hidden and multiple . every scene , every line , every image is filled with , , , . it  s poetry on film . definitely a must see , everybody that i  recommend it to it , well actually it initially then it after we about it .",1
"Through the since the end of World War 2 , we  come to regard and the Third as somewhat of a question mark in history : how could this have ? This movie , perhaps more than any other , to answer that question by a unique view of the last days of the Third . It the question of why people can be led so easily into hell and the madness of self - destruction by one man , and one idea . The bunker simply as a convenient setting to examine this question : after all , it  s only at the end , with death imminent , with time for self - reflection , that we can get a really convincing picture of the and thinking of those who were involved .  Why ?: I think that  s the central question of this movie . No more , no less . And because of that I think it  s one of the most important that have been made in a long time , maybe ever .",0
"It  s on of those that can u feel , sad ... a really good scenario and idea . Also - is there as a policeman , so this is a sure fact for a good movie as usual . In the beginning with the presentation of the job - to convince a man to not kill his wife and child , but finally they are dead because he try to save everybody but the sniper can  t shot in the way to save and the mother and the boy . There was a great scene with the dead boy with his mouth full of blood ... read nice made ! Oh , another thing in the movie was that the doter of the rich man was surprising not pretty actress and generally there  t much beauty in the movie , i mean in the face of ( except of course :)) The house of the rich family is was cool ... i watched the movie with few people and everybody was saying  wow , i want a house like this  I gave a point 10 but if there was 11 or up I  m giving it !!",1
"At best lame and disturbing . At worst a waist of 107 . If this is the best that can be done to attempt to turn a book to film , give up now . The standard of acting was good , the best performance was that of the actor the baby , sunny . I was particularly disappointed by as he simply and nothing more . The whole concept a feeble attempt at the Potter and . Please do not attempt to follow this with another embarrassing flop .",1
"Harry Potter is back and this time it  s more enjoyable than the first two . To be honest here , I actually like this movie . I was never a fan of the first two because they concentrated on eye gawky teenage than actually for a story , but the special effects and  music made up for me . All the principal from the first two return ; , Emma and are back as Harry , , and in which the story behind the Prisoner of is that a killer name Black ( ) from the prison of in which he is after Harry Potter and to kill him . Harry  t , as he is ready to kill the murderer who is after him . With an all - star cast Emma as a teacher and the late as Albus , the acting is superb in which not only the three main have , and the special effects and  music are ten times better than the first two . If you the first two , that  s fine . But I recommend this for and non - alike to see this movie .",1
"I really do not understand why some people criticize this movie . They obviously do not appreciate good action when they see it . I thought it was great ! It all the suspense I . And at the same time it was good entertainment . If you don  t like Action then don  t watch them . Ice Cube was great !! So was and the rest of the cast . May I suggest a boring action movie .. Matrix . The were fantastic . I agree that nothing will ever compare with the first but that was a different movie . I thought he story line was excellent . It me of . I recommend this movie to anyone who good action , Ice Cube and .",1
"Another  this is the way we live now  kind of movie , here with of performance as a kind of intermediary between who we are and who we want to be . Works better than most of this sort , partly because director is brave enough to give her an independent life , not to force her square into round , not to become to schematic about the whole thing . Partly too because for all of the gentleness in the movie , it  s never twee , or overly - filled with false little character or . That  s a lot harder to do than it : I am very . The , particularly from the , are first - rate : that  s another thing that often , but not here . Highly .",1
"That guy , thats all have have to say , what an idiot , he gave this 3 out of 4 and the remake of Bad News 4 out of 4 , he should just quit life right now . Anyway yeah this movie , it  t even B movie material , it was almost as bad as Torque and Open Water , like these even make like and look rentable , but i guess not every director can be a , not every actor can be a , not every writer can be a , but that  t mean they have to produce this crap . The acting all around , guess they  t pay and enough , the action and was faker then my ex , the story was and just stupid , so on and so forth , I  m done .",1
"This movie absolutely my heart and just me break down in every time I watch it . It  s such a beautiful story and , although seemingly tragic , the ending just the biggest smile on your face . I could find no in acting or cinematography and the setting was absolutely perfect . My only issue with this movie is Garner and Gena look nothing like Gosling and . Other than that it is probably my movie to date . I can  t help but feel in a world of cold when I watch this heart - warming movie . Absolute 10 / 10",1
"I have no idea what other people saw in this movie . I had 4 half hearted during the whole thing . I like the actor  s that were in the movie but I wonder why they on for it . Maybe this movie is too sophisticated for me . Maybe I am not cultured enough for it . Maybe is just . Yeah let  s go with that . The acting was horrible , the story dumb and the funny were very very sparse . Does nobody read ? It . Save your money and watch something else .",1
"Heaps entertaining , violent , funny , creepy and cheesy :) A horror movie to last , up with the ! A cool story line , acting was pretty poor but who , its a cheesy horror movie so who needs academy award winning acting ? Not me ! I was pleasantly with how well done the movie was . It everything you need for an enjoyable horror movie . Violence was awesome , brutal ! I  t believe how well done the gore and violence was . is scorching hot in it and tops it off . The movie through quick enough so you  t lose interest or the curiosity of what was next . The idea of the wax museum always been a great idea and they did it justice with this one A + I say !",1
"I  had some of mine argue that the version of the Ring ( , I think ) was much better to the two that have been made here . I the Grudge , I thought it was terrifying ( although I  t keep from thinking of as Buffy ...). In this movie , I actually , and I have never in a movie theater in my life . I actually had claw from my best friend my arm in the middle of the movie . If you  seen it , you know it to have that kind of effect when you watch it for the first time . But I  that the version is better ... is this true ?",0
"... the poor that some have written here are just more proof that movie are getting ..... want only fast action and special effects . Nothing  tedious  here .... just a slow unfolding of a highly suspenseful story that to an exciting climax . It  s one to view twice .... as many of us do with ... say .. after one is aware of the whole story , and to look for the little here and there and see if the plot is consistent . it is . as for those who because the trailer gave away too much .... why in the world are you looking at it . My wife and i put in our while are on for just that reason .",1
"This was a brilliantly written movie ! Since I had seen   I almost this to be similar ; it  t even close . This movie was a thriller , mystery , drama and love story all wrapped up in one . I kept a certain thing to happen and then it would surprise me when it went a different way . It had so many plot that you would almost expect to get lost but the thread never came unwoven . I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that really to be taken by surprise by an unexpected ending . My husband can usually figure out what  s going to happen next but this one even kept him guessing . I highly recommend this movie ! I  never had a movie that had such a mixture of confusion , fright , emotion and then total shock like this one did . It  s an absolutely incredible movie !",1
"Did you read the ? Did you like them ? Do you think it would make a great movie ? Well Since i love the and have read them about ten times or so I was very glad to hear that they finally was going to put it on the silver - screen . But what a disappointment it was to me when I that it  t the Hitchhiker  s Guide to the Galaxy I have learned to love and to for several that came out of this production but a mere shadow of the geniality of masterpiece . Don  t expect to much from this film . The movie taken some from each of the , added a lot of their own and made something that is : almost , but not quite , entirely unlike the original text . This is probably the worst book to movie transfer I have ever seen , not only because of the almost non similarity to the original text but also : the acting is bad , the special effects is even worse and I  m sad to say that the - series from 1981 is far better on all , and I  m no fan of them either .

"First off I was with the first movie . The sequel is just as good , but I think they put more into it than . I  m not saying anything bad about the movie . , yes it  s on a specific age group of 18 to 25 . So what ?! If you saw the first and  t like it , why go see the sequel ? I  m tired of who are bias towards certain , but continue to give bad of they don  t like in the first place . If you like these of action / pointless violence than go see them . If not , do us all a favor and keep these bad to yourself . Secondly , I was in the military and I know how to spot something that just  t fit in a shoot  em up movie . Again , I was . No , just . That  s how I feel about this movie . Good from beginning to end .",1
"This movie a lot of surrounding it and fast become a amongst the young . I can see why this is . used popular music from and written a story that is very appealing to young . But when it comes to actually looking at the film in of , acting , script - writing and whatever other are to make a good movie - the film just to make it over the line . Firstly , the is extremely mediocre , but that is understandable considering  s experience and this being his first film . There are some ( in particular one in which is sitting on a couch as the night by him ) which seem like they are only there to make it look like he can direct , as if to say  this is a creative way of a scene , look at my talent !! Secondly , the acting is as great as it is made out to be . But as least can admit that about himself . When it comes to Portman she does not give her best performance . Her voice is whiny and she over a lot . Holm is ordinary and his talent could be used in finer . Peter is pretty good , about a lively spirit to the film . Then comes the story and the script . The story basically the life of ( ) as he goes back to his for a funeral and he how his have and how the town .. boy girl .. you know the rest . Personally , I  t find the story that riveting , it was alright but the fact that I  t really like the much brought down the film a lot . The script  t all that wonderful either . come into the film and you never see them again . Even though that is breaking the of usual script writing ( which I like ) it is annoying when you are to someone and you never see them again . Overall , the movie is something that you see once and forget . It  s not as brilliant as it  s made out to be ( and really does not deserve the 8 star rating it on !). It  s an average movie that might be worth seeing if you are a fan of , the involved , or just something to fill time .",0
"The first crow had and a bit of cheese strewn about but is a classic - it had Lee and the right mood . The second - just an attempt at in on sequel , just - but had a good cinematographer . the third ....  t know about . the forth I see at the video store - I see tara , , and think they are probably smart enough to not ruin there beginning by doing a movie that . there industry smart right ? furlong worried me - I thought maybe they would be able to carry him ? This film is so bad that I feel embarrassed for the cast , director , and especially O  . They cast and director should be beaten with bats - driven to in the trunk of a car - and left for dead near a pack of hungry dogs . My neighbor  s ten - year - old son could could have made a better film . Whoever wrote the screenplay should be dragged naked over a field of broken glass and then thrown into salt - water filled drum . During a where you hear of panic in some gymnasium there is this chick ( an extra ) seen over  s shoulder with a drink in her hand staring at the the back of his head with a stupid look on her face - Mind you , the rest of the crowd - screaming for fear of being - she just there ....... she is probably just in disbelief that the are cheesy with the conviction of a crack whore saying that she  quit after one more rock . There is not one moment of this film that  t make me cringe . for those of you who praise this film and say that worth watching ..... The hospital should pull your feeding because you have been proved to be brain - dead ; there sadly , is no hope for you . think about it ! If the thought this film was good enough to market it would have been in . How many get great advertising ? A WHOLE BUNCH DO - C  mon ,  Baby  got and was in .

"hey this movie was a little slow to get and there were like el who could have been a little better .. but the story line was good furlong made an excellent crow .. me of lee .. a lot .. this movie also my approval over the crow 2 and the crow 3 nothing as of yet the crow 1 .. it was original .. the crow series up though in part 2 when .. they should have rolled a sequel off it .. but you know how that goes .. anyway watch this flick its tight ... and make sure to look for  raven  eternal pain .. coming soon from the of   you  like the comic trust me !",1
"A 9 out of 10 only for some budget that show a bit . By all skip the director commentary because its all about lack of funds . Understandable , but obnoxious to sit through . Let me just comment on a few not much in the customer . First , despite what  s stated by many and even the plot summary , the population shown here is not to the point of being  emotionless . People have to feel enough to care about family , the , succeeding at their , . Rather , the and of emotion have been chemically . Although this is taught from birth to be necessary for  sense  purity , the real reason is that it it easier for a repressive regime to stay in power and at least partially prevent rebellion . And for anyone who the mass public attendance of political is unrealistic , go rent  Triumph of the Will  by the chronicler of ascendancy , . And remind yourself that  s  t even . Second , although the drug is used to control , its good old indoctrination that behavior . The state is by every mind control practice you can think of . are for out , tattle on , . While the immediate reward is continued survival of the ratter at the expense of the , you still get the sense that even can feel some level of satisfaction in brownie , done their  duty , their family , whatever . Careful watching or re - watching of this movie that people around the of the main express of emotion according to their job status , with those in more regular less rein on their . By contrast one key character is obviously off his , though some seem to think this was either bad acting or some kind of continuity error . Actually its important to the plot . In a truly emotionless society no one would even bother to procreate or care for . So even ( Bale ) permitted to indicate a flicker of pride over his young son  s acceptance into the cleric training school , which he right in front of the most important boss he . From what we see its only he and his fellow who are trained to squelch their entirely , as well they might since they are the cruel enforcement arm of their society  s vicious . Third , Bale a lot of credit for the way this movie . He does a wonderful job of making us care about a nearly - expressionless man who his own liberation in motion through one simple accident ( or is it ?) while brushing his teeth , a small personal cleansing that bigger are coming . He  s soon hard by he  s never been to feel , that both intrigue and frighten him and which he dare not express . Its almost worth the price of rental / purchase to see him play a man hearing his first music , or sitting and watching his sleep late one night . Even as we realize he  s feeling paternal love to a degree he  s never felt it before , the fact remains he still can  t show it and his can  t know it or they  turn him in . By the time he a key event in his personal life , you can feel its horrific impact on him by the flicker of reaction on his face , and in the in body language . The tension between what he and and what he to show to an sub - climax that the finale in motion . Fourth , the different between what is of people in this dark future and how human nature really is used to great effect .  s special skill as a cleric is his ability to anticipate what beneath , what  s behind the wall , what his quarry is thinking . In other , to sense . This him suspect as well as valuable to his . The feeling of personal jeopardy wonderfully as he more and hide it , particularly as he his special mission is being by his new partner . The best - fi is never about technology , the best martial are never about the fighting . The human heart may never have perfect equilibrium , and this quiet little classic of a movie sure never got its due in a limited theatrical release . But its worth your time and then some .",1
"I actually went to the video store to come out with a copy of SPUN , but it was hired out so the attendant i should give this movie a try . I got home angry about my choice . But when I to watch this movie I was like  what the hell is going on  but as you watch it , it you in the heart and leaves you wanting more . Just like the many used in this movie REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is . But for some strange reason this movie a lot to so many of my , constantly in the drug scene . So I guess if you don  t know anything about to begin with , you will get a massive shock . Because this is the utter truth . But it me really sad because , well I wont give away any plot but it just you inside to see these people wrecking themselves and how horrible and scary their become . Plus my heart even more when you realize that not only do these for people have to go through so much trauma but these kind of happen to so many people everyday . This movie had me on the edge of my seat wanting more of this shocking truth . so bring it on .",1
"Since the original Crow movie I was a fan of the concept and story of love after death and the bitter sweet taste of revenge . Lee was amazing in the original and made the movie legendary . The Crow : City of was sub par at best . The Crow : Salvation some hope for line of . However Wicked Prayer brought it all down to the way I felt after the first . They should have stopped there  read the book I was looking forward to the new setting and how they would rework the urban feel of the film which worked for a bit , however horrible acting , poor and death that  t strike fear into the heart of a 6 year old . Furlong as the crow was just sad , Tara who can usually put out a decent performance was horrible and Hopper .... how the mighty have fallen . ( although at times over the time ) made the movie amusing , although whenever he an like performance it to bring out the best in him . Watching someone be taken out by a fly was laughable . If you have NOTHING better to do and are a fan of the franchise , go for it , so you can at least say you  seen all of them . If you don  t want to have the memory of what Lee did any more then it already been , keep walking past the movie and don  t look back .",0

All I have to say is don  t judge the movie by its title . Its an outstanding movie",0

"I been a several now since visual effects the audience into marking a movie great . Since the computer effects for Park in 1994 , gradually it become a standard for all . Even now are to use respectable visual effects . Of course , now we are used to computer . The first Matrix had us on the new 360 visual effect . Now I don  t think anyone is by it . I think this is good . Because sometime after the start of this new millennium , big movie studio still think special effects will push a movie to the top in the box office . Not . The Lord of the is faithfully based on a master piece of literature . a lifetime in this book . It would be great for a writer to continue on his work . To add - on the to after the Lord of the . In conclusion , Definitely we have to expect great backed by great special effects , not the other way around .",1

Fortunately , with his effort , Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , does not fall far from the level of innovation he with his first two . Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a strikingly original story that both romance and memory loss like no other . It is yet another eccentric and aesthetic tale from one of  s most gifted that all will surely find sharp , fresh , and cognitive . Not only together a screenplay on an often - subject matter , but he also an aptly title that the power to place in a state of surrealism and wonderment right from the get - go . The title of the picture is taken from a poem  to  by Pope . This historic elegy , which also used in Being , directly to the human brain  s power of recollection . Reminiscent of both Memento and 50 First , Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with the loss of memory ; however ,  s script the frequently used topic an twist .

Once that erased him from her head entirely , he directly to Lacuna for the very same service . However , once the Lacuna , ( Wood ), ( Mark ) and Mary ( Dunst ), start out from  s mind , their service becomes a disservice ; becomes contrite and his mind about the procedure . Even though is unconscious during the entire erasure , he consciously to retain the of his love for within the of his own head , and to on to at least a fragment of what they once had . There is no question about it , this  s work . He a clear spirited depth to the part of \u0097 making  s most stark yet most respectable character role to date . Even though Eternal Sunshine may not be one of biggest money making ( to his ), it certainly him on the path of being as an actor who is capable of seriousness . At far as earning an nod for  04 , because of the film  s early release date and the fierce competition up for the Best Actor , will most likely be . In addition to  s career performance , the remainder of the ensemble cast equally as well . up some of her best non - acting as the orange - haired and sporadically . ( Sorry for the slang .) Her work here is better than anything else she done \u0097 with the possible exception of her other near - astounding 2004 effort in Finding Neverland . Dunst and Mark are as faultless as always , and both and Wood are as top - notch as in their respective supporting . With his superb use of light ( or more appropriately darkness ) and his watertight scene , director an utter joy of a film that cleverly out near the end and then back upon itself by the conclusion . Overall , the quirky yet visual genius of combined with the warped yet brilliant mind of undoubtedly in a beautiful and poignant romance . The manner in which Eternal Sunshine its romance and comedy the film a strong sense of undeniable individuality and for an overtly pleasing picture . Eternal Sunshine the aptitude to tickle your thinking cap , sooth your sight , and hypnotize your heart . Beyond any shadow of a doubt , Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in the absolute upper echelon of all that is romantic and unique .",1
"Although this is a fictional account of the event , I feel it is perhaps the best portrayal of life and times of the Titanic era .

": ( to his men ) ! My of the sword ! I would rather fight beside you than any army of ! Let no man forget how menacing we are , we are ! Do you know what  s waiting beyond that beach ? Immortality !

This is the movie that could have made into a Steven - esquire Director , a star of Eric , a leading man of Bloom , brought Brad up to Cruise  s ( figurative ) height and left as a potential . Instead , this movie . BADLY . Now the can be either obvious or . I  m in the middle . As an action - adventure movie , I want big action type and kick - ass battle . It action and battle , but they  re disappointing . Really you would have so much more in the action , it could have been so much better . It good acting from Peter O  , Cox , Eric and Bean , and Bloom do well , the most disappointing was Brad . In this movie he was supposed to be the hero and I thought he was a prat . Eric , really , was supposed to be the villain and yet I preferred him to Brad  Arm  . It no longer had c in it , which would have really tipped it over the edge . Instead was just a brilliant fighter . This movie was more in realism , which gave it that extra edge . Watch it if you want , but prepared to be disappointed . In the year 1193 B .

"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , one of the most of recent , is mostly a parable about how should accept their destiny instead of it . But while the general meaning is fairly simple , the script is complex , a non - linear narrative ( a la  Lost Highway  or  Memento ), past and present , dream and reality , the of the main . The direction further this elaborate scheme : there are cut - , special effects , imaginative montage , but also a post - modern between . Thus the film is sometimes a lyrical love - story , at other times a comedy , realist drama , analysis and so on . Unfortunately , a big part of the movie to melodrama ( complete with generic sentimental music ). It as if the director is mostly interested in showing off his rather than an interesting and organic movie . Vastly inferior to the similar  L   ( 1996 , ).",1

"I find it disappointing that there is no 0 on the 1 - 10 scale . This is the worst movie i have seen . Not only is it gory beyond belief , but no story line and leaves you with many that would have put the movie together . The beginning with the opening and the girl supposedly being through a hall , with blood all over her was disturbing and unrelated - unless she was . Then there was this other person on the bus who i at first thought to be the creep but  t and you never saw him again .( the guy i  m to is the one that had blood all over his eye .) the creep was weird , i had no clue what it was supposed to be , maybe a dead guy or something , but he more like a creature .. and he could talk , which confused me a bit . Now i am only 12 turning 13 old , so maybe this movie was more disturbing to me then the other . I enjoy watching a good horror movie to get a good scare , but this movie  t really scary just disgusting and filled with gore and had no story line .",0
"Alone in the Dark is proof that people really need to see for themselves before them . I remember the movie lasting barely two at the box office , and getting a 1 % rating at Rotten . . After listening to my friend  s rambling about how this was the worst movie ever made , that the director Boll to be be loaded as cargo on a kamikaze plane , I decided to stay clear of it entirely . Well , by some funny accident , I saw it anyway . I rented of the Dead last night and found a for Alone in the Dark sitting snugly in its place with  , LOSER , written across disk instead . I figured that since this would probably be the only time I would ever be able to see it , because I would have never rented it on my own time . I must admit that extremely low had something to do with it , but I  t find this movie to be nearly as bad as most people said it was . Sure , it  s bad , maybe even worthy , but it had enough style to stay entertaining . The movie up with some painfully slow text that up the screen , spoon - feeding you the plot within 60 . One thing to note is that this was actually a bit of a bonus , because without it the actual movie would have been too to stand . The action in fast enough , and our main hero does battle with some random character who  s role  t even made clear until HALFWAY through the film . That  s the major weakness of Alone in the Dark . The plot and story telling  t exactly solid gold , it  s more like copper . The movie is inept , , hard to follow for the first 30 . There are a lot of that could have made it much better . A different style of , better music , and some proper research on military tactics and protocol could have really done for the whole project . As far as acting , the only thing it going for it is Slater , who off a great performance . The rest of the cast is mediocre at best , and the line delivery is sometimes clumsy enough to land most of them in a special education school . The score is about twice as messy as the script for the film . It  s horrible , and the guy who composed it should be doing music for . The action that goes with it is some of the most stylish and entertaining I  seen , but a lot of it is pointless , and just  t a part of the story . The themselves are extremely cool , and for the first time since The Lost World we  re that shading and atmosphere are just as important as the itself . It  s damn good , and the look realistic enough to be put in a zoo . On that note , there  s enough in Alone in the Dark for me to enjoy it at least , but it  s a mess of mindless action , horrid writing and some of worst music I  in a long time . 4 / 10",0
", we all know what we are to expect from a S . S . film . Definitely not good quality cinema , but a lot of ! Even if I did get the , I also got quite upset about how they portray our country . The level of ignorance of these people is astounding !! What you can find in the real : people whose language is and whose accent is different from the rest of South and only similar to the accent ; democracy ; very little evidence of our heritage ; looking people ( we are mostly of and ) What you will find in  submerged  : people who speak with a totally different accent from ours , probably from Central ; people whose written language is sometimes , sometimes another language ( pay attention to submarine , find the   and  revolution ); a revolution going on ; (!!!); Viking looking men and looking (!!!!!) So , just for the record , the country you  see in submerged is not ( actually , it  s ), though for some reason the people involved in submerged thought it would be a good idea to say it place here . Anyway , I invite everyone to laugh at this joke of a film , just remember our country is nothing like submerged ... and if you know someone from , watch submerged together , and you  have even more fun !!!",1

We don  t have , we don  t have any , we have a ( truly ) democratic government with 80 % of acceptance among the population , we have no at all ( and we don  t like them either ) and no major incident here since the late 70  s .

I will give the writer credit - it was well out . If you miss the last five of the movie , you  the entire movie .

"I lost more than three in my life watching this crap I  m really of the , the , and the millions of this movie . The story : It was clear from the first part what is going to happen ! no need to waste your money on two and the return of the king . The acting , to be fair , most of the cast their own , but the problem was that the worst actor got the biggest share : Wood ! come on ! that puppy face might have worked when you were three , but here , it is really over used and not at all convincing . Pace : at the beginning its good , then it slows down until it the snail speed at about two left to the movie ending . I mean ... COME ON ! was the last 40 even necessary ? Special effects : they are the only reason why I  t give the movie 1 star . : AN !!!! I  m he  t get a ! I mean come on , the pace was totally unrealistic , one universe , people are gathering and fighting then gathering some more then running then doing all of stuff and fighting some more , and in a a parallel universe , the stupid is only climbing a mountain from beginning of the movie till the end ! Another stupid thing was when he brought in in some and shoot them from behind to show that they are and his midget , then in the next take a frontal view of and his gang , the really stupid and how much a viewer can numb his mind . The director was NOT convincing . To be fair , it is a hard film to direct , but that should have made the lame Peter leave the task with someone more capable . All in all : crap .",0
"i have read a lot of / on this movie and i know a lot of people that  t like it  t understand it . I understood it but still ... it ! Mainly for 2 number 1 nothing was scary . The commercial made it look terrifying the worst part was the noise and it was only scary the first time you hear it ( scary eh more like unexpected ). After that its more like just annoying . Number 2 its predictability . I knew what was going to happen at least 5 before it did ! For those who  t figure out why Bill suicide then i suggest watching it again cause that was definitely !",1
"This is the kind of movie love , film swoon over , and the rest of us can  t get too excited about . I see it as an exercise in minimalism . Given a talented star and supporting cast , a known director , cool music , and a green light from the studio , can you make a successful movie with a script ? A script that  t contain much ? That the star precious few and him to show as little emotion as possible ? That the next - door neighbor a much more interesting character ? After seeing it , I  m thinking , well , it  s different , it  s , but I don  t consider it a great movie , or a successful movie , or even one I  want to see again . I don  t recommend that you go out and pay $ 9 . 00 to see it .",0
"I remember walking past the movie display for this flick before it was . The name made me do a double take . Lemony Snicket  s A Series Of Unfortunate ? What the hell ? It so odd and mysterious and unique . The movie itself ? Not as much . But still better than every Harry Potter movie I  ever seen . The Potter remind me a lot of Lemony Snicket . is good as the evil Count . But as in most of his he from Syndrome . That is like Robin , L . , Jack , and Woody , he  t a character . He  s , just like Jack Jack and Sam Sam , and Robin Robin and Woody Woody . is doing his usual stand - up routine here . The odd - esquire and facial . The bit where does his dinosaur impression from his acting troupe should have been left on the cutting room floor . That is NOT . That  s a stand - up routine . It  s an amusing bit , I guess . But it from the purity of the Snicket and the character . Perhaps or would have been a better casting choice . The story is the tale of the ( love that name !) and their psychotic relative Count trying to bump them off so he can claim their inheritance . The are perfectly cast , all of them , Violet and Sunny . And this is coming from someone who  t like . Director Brad does a bang up job along with his set designer showing us beautiful and bleak looking . One of the I like most about the film is its emptiness . That is , the live in world devoid of people . Or a lot people anyway . That would seem to be the ideal childhood . Very few other people around . And being schooled at home by your or people hired to raise you . No , no school , no inane peer pressure of state schooling to turn you into a mindless , left wing or right wing government schooled drone . People are like liquor , all right in small , but too much will ruin your life and make you puke your out . The screenplay could have been better and  t always capture the magic of the . And Streep a bit out of place in her role , I found her annoying and her to die . While Billy was a fine fit for his part ( as much as I hate ). If you are a fan of dark  s that remind one of the Brother  s , A Series Of Unfortunate is the imperfect modern day  s fairy tale for you .",1
"When we grow up , we cannot think like we were . We are losing the ability of imagination . The exhausted writer was in sagging . When he met the family of widow , he himself . Through with the , he got much inspiration . Finally he wrote a well - known work . The interaction between and the was the best part in the movie . Every time I as if I came back my childhood . In fact from a child you can learn much . The can be good for us . They are full of imagination . The final part was unforgettable . When sick watched the Neverland , the splendid place also touched my heart deeply . I think everyone one  s Neverland . If you really want it , it will come to you . I think that was the most appropriate man for the role . His character was fully in accordance with the role . His acting was impeccable . also brought us wonderful performance .

"Kung Fu are inherently ridiculous with their balletic . This movie that constant over the top action with slapstick and Looney . I out loud during the husband beating , the inept knife throwing , the Road Runner chase , and the Pinball battle . Everybody some Kung Fu from the frumpy landlady and her man to  The Beast , who more like a resident than a Master . But like all great , this movie tribute to the same it at . The fight in this movie are better than any knockoff . The special effects and sound effects are quite good , because action needs sound and those stylish snapping are here whenever anyone is hit . This in the same class as The Princess Bride and Of The Dead .",1
"well , i was really disappointed with this . after being absolutely blown away by van sant  s last film , elephant , i was so looking forward to this too . and since elephant , in some ways , covered similar ground ( it was an of a columbine - like school shooting incident , this is an of  s last days ), i thought there was a lot of hope for it . alas , it  s really , in the end , just dull .  cinematography is quite beautiful at times , and very melancholy , but where in elephant it felt as if the and heavy had a lot to say about the monotony of school life , here they just labour the point that is sad , wistful , perhaps already dead . there  s a point , but we got it five in , you know ? does a pretty good , but he  s not identical , and that sort of me . of course it  s going to be impossible to find someone really identical most of the time , but perhaps more could have been done with make - up ( i  m thinking  s transformation in monster ). in all , there were some nice where you felt as if were probably spot on - even if van sant  t guess the of  s final days wandering the earth , he certainly to have the atmosphere and that i imagine would have been there - but the film just  t have enough drama to hold up . now i  m glad that van sant  t feel it necessary to over - ( ie . make up ) anything ( although what was with him talking to himself ? it a little art school to me ...), but perhaps if the story was just too dull to hold our interest , it was too dull to be made ? nice idea , experiment , i guess . it  s funny though ; reading through some of the other here on , maybe i should this .  s performance was perfectly , defined more by his lack of life than anything he actually . the stark human were exactly how you might imagine to have been , and - as a  mood film , as one reviewer it - the film works well enough . perhaps then , it  s good , and it  s merely my own that meant my interest  t . anyway , i respect van sant - while he might make unusual , he never leaves you without anything to think about . edit : later , and i now adore this film - go figure . i guess it just took a while to settle in my mind , but i  come to respect the subtlety with which van sant it , and i  m totally in love with the manner in which we meander through the days just as did himself .",0
"All right , here  s the deal : if you  re easily offended then you might want to stay far , far away from this one . There are some painfully funny in the movie , but I probably about as much as I . Actually , I probably MORE than I . And if I  t literally blushing on the outside , then I was blushing on the inside . If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that you then you simply have no shame . Whether that  s a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder I suppose . I will not deny that I quite a bit , but this is a movie that I simply cannot give a blanket recommendation due to its subject matter . If I were to say ,  This movie is hilarious , go check it out ! and some sweet , little old church - going lady to the theater and a heart - attack during one of the graphically explicit sex , well , that  s just something I don  t need on my conscience . So how is it ? , try about 100 times worse than The Wedding . Honestly . My would  out during the first scene . I feel it  s my duty to at least warn you of what to expect . There is some cleverly intelligent comedy here , but that  s what I come to expect from the man ( ) who had a hand in both and and Undeclared . I  m all for making fun of ; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give a run for his money . Rudd proclaiming ,  If I hear Ya Mo Be There one more time I  Ya Mo burn this place down , is hilarious , but it  s one of those that the majority of the audience won  t appreciate . And when we see a quick 3 - second of singing along to Cameo  s Word Up , I for a good two after the joke was over , whereas most everybody and then forgot about it . Strangely enough , despite the , there  s an admirable moral to the story . The movie  t portray as some freaky loser just because he  s a virgin . He  s really as a likable , admirable character . Sure , he  s a little weird . After all , he a framed poster ,  more than an , and a toy collection that the Million Dollar Man  s BOSS , but we  re never led to believe that there  s actually anything wrong with the fact that he  s a virgin . As odd as it may seem , there  s a bit of an  it  s to wait  message . But man , oh man , please be that this its R rating about as far as it can go . That was certainly  s intention . According to him , he just let some of the ( particularly and ) and talk the way they normally talk , all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty . If you can handle that or talk that way yourself , then you  love the movie . I  m not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex . I find that subtle , clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 of the f - word or sex . But that  s me . Like I said , there are some absolutely hysterical here , but you have to ask yourself if they  re worth sitting through one of the most vulgar you  re likely to ever see at the theater . I just don  t know how interested most will be in what  s by men while poker . Honestly ladies , you might not want to know . If you  ever been curious why some think are gross , well , this you a good idea . There you go - my humble , honest take on what to expect . Be that your guide . It definitely should not be seen with your School class , , , any family of the opposite sex , of any age , or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion . If you  d see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it to be uncomfortable .",1
"I decided to watch this film for two : First , many people around me were raving about it , and second , I had  s previous film  About . The latter film was truly honest , at times really comical , at times really tragic , and very philosophical . However , even though  Sideways  to be set along similar -- some not so successful middle aged white searching for meaning in their -- I found almost nothing of the spirit of  About  in  s new film . It may be that my appreciation of  About  my disappointment with  Sideways ; however , I might not even have watched the latter had I not known that it was made by the director of the former . Sorry to say , but  Sideways , in my view , is nothing but a teeny - style film for . Interestingly , in my experience , it is a teeny - style film that to be especially in academic . I wonder why . Is it the  wine  background of the story ? Is it the main character who is as an but unsuccessful novelist ? Both are not very interesting . I personally do not like the taste of oak barrel , which is common to , but much prefer good .  Sideways  certainly  t made me appreciate wine to the extent that   s Feast  made me appreciate well - prepared and sophisticated . Again , what is intellectually interesting about someone who unsuccessfully to get a novel if we hardly get to know anything about the novel itself ? We learn only in the end -- through Maya  s voice mail message -- that the content to be somehow autobiographical . is obviously just a narcissist if he to publish an autobiographical novel about a not very interesting life and that it may be accepted . That by itself may not be decisive -- you do not need to be able to identify with the main or want to invite them over for dinner , as one reviewer pointed out . However , since the content of the novel does not become any issue in the film except as a to secure  s love interest Maya , we are left with the general idea that the main motive to publish a novel is to be   by people and that there is not really much else to it . And this is not just what we think is  own personal motive -- it  s what the film itself us by not dwelling on the content of the book that he had written . Is that interesting ? Otherwise , the film around about the nature of ( white male upper middle class US - ) crises ; it never centering on sex and ( heterosexual ) love . There is nothing else ; no politics , no philosophical on life , no really interesting taken up . The only interesting character to be Maya -- but she is , like all younger in the film -- reduced to a mere love interest . This is another strong message the film out : Young are interesting only inasmuch as they are potential of sex or sexual love . Overall , the film all our human to finding a suitable ( hetero ) sexual partner . Once you found one you  be happy , and all the rest is unimportant . I was to death also by some  comical  like the one in which Jack  s wallet from the waitress  s home in the middle of her sexual intercourse with her husband -- this is pure stuff , sorry ! And seeing Bush and on the screen in the background during that event does not add any more wit to that scene , or to the film in general , for that matter ... Finally , we do not only not understand what actually the two male together , apart from the mere fact that they had been  at San State , but we understand even less what the two female  best  together . Do we ever see them being engaged in a conversation ? We know they must talk to each other , otherwise the plot  t have worked out ( i . e ., when Maya about Jack  s upcoming marriage ). However , all we get to know about their is that they are just about ... But at the same time we are to think that Maya is somehow intellectually interested and smart . Whoever this film realistic must live in a very shallow culture and know nothing else . To be sure , I do not mind if are unrealistic . However , I do mind if a film that one to death with cheap while at the same time trying -- and apparently succeeding -- to appeal to large of people who think of themselves as educated and progressive .",1
"I knew almost nothing of this film before I saw it but based on a couple I had , I went with my dad to see it tonight . Some people on how slow the movie is during the beginning , and although that is true , it is there to give you time to develop a story and actual care about the . This is definitely not a movie for people with near zero attention from the Generation . This movie also  t rely on such as or what I call  shaky camera syndrome  where the insist on making the audience nauseous by running around with handy - ( ala Supremacy ). I really the story and thought all the were well . The final raid scene is amazing . They did a really good job of explaining exactly what they to do beforehand and when it actually , you understood where everyone was running to and what they were trying to accomplish . Excellent movie , and highly . Definitely one of the best so far of the year , I  m just sad that almost no one about it and the movie received so little promotion . I doubt this picture will even make $ 20 million here . And one more thing , I thought it was a very tasteful and respectful thing to do at the end during the where they archival footage of the real being .",1
"I can  t find anything wrong about this film . Because I  m not a fan and usually don  t go for the romantic - drama genre , I until the release to view the film ; I  t have . Closer is wonderfully , that true , and ultimately is able to achieve a powerful narrative by few other to date . A masterpiece that will be studied and revered for to come . The picture , centrally , with the inherent in the modern relationship : trust , betrayal , and vulnerability . Closer probably  t a good date film , nor even a   film , it  t bubbly . It is , however , the director  best work to date , which is saying something , remember he was responsible for The Graduate . This movie  t as culturally significant as The Graduate , but I prefer it nonetheless , as it to reflect a more mature and honest view of human . And then there is the acting . Clive deserved best actor , Portman another outstanding performance , and Law , once again , why he  s the new ( probably will never get the acclaim he , like , or for that matter , due to hunk - marketing ). By the end of the film , none of the away unblemished , and yet you empathize and identify with all of their , as if you can imagine yourself making similar . was wise enough to depict the youthful quartet as naive , stupid , cruel , narcissistic and selfish . I suspect this movie too close to the bone for some . I have to reiterate , this  t a happy consumer - land film . This is serious cinema revealing the many of us are prone to make while young and searching . I  m glad can still make a movie like this . Life  t a beer commercial and not all of us want trite escapism all the time . Cinema , at its best as in Closer , is capable of so much more . I appreciate a silly genre movie as well as the next person , but sometimes a person something with more substance , a film working on a different plane . A film like a good novel , teaching you a little more about yourself and your fellow man . Finally , I have to note the superb , and somewhat risky reliance the made Rice  s unforgettable song  The Blower  s Daughter  to set the tone for the film . The choice was shrewd giving the film a melancholy , but humane , quality of romance .",1
"I can only say this , I read the - 9 review and I can only say this , I am sure you have never seen Elephant or I haven  t seen as well , as well with Last Days , but I thought Elephant was one great show , this is an Art film you should know that , are they going to make a story like this into a action film with and such , NO !!!! You are most likely just another person among the other millions of people who come see this because it  s a slight take on life , just because you  been a fan since he  t mean its going to be a good movie , and neither was his life , so why in name would this be a real good movie , maybe watch it with a clear mind and try to feel what the actor is feeling . Or just don  t watch it at all !",0
"Let us get a few out of the way . Craven is known for his mastery over and , but lately his have been failing . It is almost as if he lost his touch . With this movie , he only gains it back a little . On a plane , a young woman is forced to take a part of a menacing plan of a killer . That is a somewhat interesting story . It could have been an interesting movie . But before I get into that , I  talk about the good this in it . First of all , Murphy an excellent ( and creepy ) bad guy . I have to give him that , especially after this and his performance as the Scarecrow in Batman . But even with his talent for evil , this movie is just not very attention - . It a good setting and atmosphere -- in a plane , close to many other people , claustrophobia , terror ... like that . It is just what in this movie that it not that great . It is very predictable and the that the main lady are sometimes pretty lame . The movie a totally different turn during the last half hour and it is not a very good one . It just becomes bland and you know what is going to happen , and you  re just waiting for it to happen . This could have been an intense and very tight thriller that us on their edge of our seat , but it is only something to watch with a notch of . After seeing this , you might just want to get a bit of shut eye . It is forgettable and nothing really special at all . Murphy is beautiful and eerie , but if you want to see him as a bad guy , see him in Batman . If not even the caught your attention , then you should move on . This movie is NOT bad . It its . But it could have been more intriguing . Craven could have done a lot better than this . But if you are a fan of his or if you like cheap with predictability , then you may like this movie =) 6 / 10",0
"When you get two life , maybe you are in total despair especially you are innocent . But the banker was not . He still had a hope for his future . He thought every possible way to get out of the prison . When the hope that his innocence openly broke out , he decided to escape from the prison with his way . He was quite a smart person . Even his friend Red did not know his escape plan . He did it . So Red too . Their reunion at the beach was the scene in the movie . Although the movie got many academy , it got nothing in the end . However it won the heart of people . I think that its positive connotation is enough to move every one . That is why it is still so popular after 11 . We should not abandon hope at any circumstance . Without hope , without future . convincingly the sympathizing banker . His another impressive movie was The player . Morgan Freeman should have won the academy award . If that , he did not have to wait 11 to get the award ( best supporting actor for Million dollar baby ). A movie can bring you hope . 8 / 10",1

"Man this movie is so different from the original plot and it was bad . I mean it was very boring , even trough the battle i was yawning . And , who is trying to be a , s acting was poor . But the thing i most was the story which had almost nothing to do with what Homer wrote or whit what . I something better from this movie but i left disappointed . Of course the effects and were nice and that and Bloom  s performance are the only a about this movie . If you want big with a lot of effects and really entertaining and tragic story watch  Lord of The  one more time . No this high budget fiction  based  on Homer  s tragedy .",0
"Being a virgin was best for  s mother , but losing virginity is a right of passage for most . For  s it  s a nightmare he for 40 . He  s a reluctant virgin by more than one aggressive girl in his youth , but his think his time come . Thus a tortuous journey to love and maturity for an electronics store salesman whose idea of a good time is making a perfect omelet or his perfectly action . I thought  Must Love Dogs  with and Lane was the best romantic comedy of the summer , and more than I hoped for . But Virgin goes beyond just middle - aged dating ; it the value of holding out for a higher level of meaning when engaging in sex ;, and it the social that foster promiscuity . Ultimately it on the right mixture by and his business neighbor , Keener  s . Along the way is some insightful writing , often with irony , by and his two . For instance , those who haunt video for offbeat know immediately that when is to be tough like in Jade , the are and knowing .

"Last year I saw the first   movie with Diesel , and recall that it like a  blue collar Bond  movie . I suppose Diesel either  t available , or too expensive , so Ice Cube the new agent . ICE Cube is pretty good , not a Diesel by any , but the movie not from him but from a very marginal script and a heavy emphasis on and the special effects that go along with them . The current rating is  4  and that is about right . Ice Cube is Stone , former agent now in prison . He needs incentive to with the request for his assistance , and it comes in the news that someone is out to wipe out him and all former of a group . So , either sit in jail and wait to be , or get out there and help hunt them down first . : Peter the US President , who an agenda of peace and . His right hand military man ( ) the US would be by such a stance and , in a misguided mission he must neutralize the president .

"After reading the previous comment about this film and the reviewer subsequently rating the film a 1 / 10 and going on to in general , i wish to portray a wholly more open view about this COMEDY . Get a sense of humour and get it fast , this film is indeed crude it is indeed full of sexual innuendo  s but that  s the point . I  t go into the much in the way of a plot , and came out very pleasantly by just how funny this film actually was .......... its not smart comedy , its not subtle ... its in your face , brash and sometimes down right disgusting , but it did what few   have to do this year and thats bring a genuine smile to my face . Comedy in my humble opinion lost something that it had in the . That little something is making a film out of nothing , where not much actually , and yet an hour and a half by and you wonder where it went . It lost the of such as Dumb and , Happy and Billy .... now i don  t mean to place Deuce into their sort of league but it their formula . It is a formula that still works ! The partnership here of Rob Schneider and Griffin works ever so well , within 5 of the film starting when they visit the was in . It  t stop there , the are simple but constant and left me in a great mood by the end of the film !! People need to stop this genre and accept it for what it is . A barrel of crude , where you can let your hair down , put your up and know that you are going to be .",1
"Basically there are going to be two of people who will watch this movie , those who feel that sex is something not to be feared and can be about , and those who still feel that sex is evil , sinful , and that those who joke about sex will be damned to the eternal pit of . For those of you who are not about sex , this movie is hilarious . Rob Schneider  t give a crap about what anybody about him , and in society of suffocating ultra - conservative , that  s a breath of fresh air . Why ? Because this movie about taboo , and them out from underneath the rug . Sexuality is part of being human and the human experience , and it should be , not hidden . How could anyone be or at all by the subject matter in this movie ?  t it completely obvious that . Schneider is a pervert by now ? This is the SEQUEL to a notoriously perverted movie for God  s and been to rated  R ! What in the the heck do you expect !?! A story !?! Yes this movie is filled with of perverted sexual , but the truth is more than half the people in the world probably have a sexually perverted side to them , and they keep it hidden in the closet . I think everyone should stop being and just go let their inner enjoy this movie .",1
"I  been waiting so long to get round to seeing this movie , and now that I have ? Thank God I bought it cheap on . Is it supposed to be a horror film , a spoof , what ? I don  t know . What it is , is dull . When nothing had by about the half way mark , I thought great , they  re obviously building to a gross out climax . Imagine my surprise when the rolled . It  s a horror movie without suspense , without gore , without ... HORROR ! The family are obviously , they obviously kill a lot of people . What a shame that  t make it on screen . What you get is 2 of  mad folk , and one girl in particular screaming non - stop . Credit where it  s due ; on the back of the case it  back to a golden age when horror really meant horror and the guarantee of cinematic was more of a threat than a promise . They  t lying ! I thought it was a typo ! Lame . Anyone want to buy a second hand ?",0

I  never read the novel and therefor had no idea who or what Hitchhiker was ... This movie a strong sense about it ... the dry humor and the  overall ability to act properly . Yes , this movie was impressive and I it very much . It is without a doubt the anti hit of this year and for once a movie exist that was actually made for an audience with some brains .",0
"I knew nothing of this movie before it from our local video store . Being a fan , I thought I  d give it a try . What a waste of film ! Thank God I bought pop corn or it would have been a total waste of my time . This movie should be by a disclaimer that  If you  re a male of average intelligence , you might consider channel for a sporting event happening somewhere in the world because this is a chick flick and it . This was absolutely the worst film I  seen since Grant in that ultimate piece of crap , Hill ( currently available at for just $ 9 . 09 - does that tell you something ?). Talk about slow to develop . I was able to slip out of the room , catch three of the game , grab a cold one , pop my pop corn and return to the movie and not miss a thing !. I  d sooner put in my before I watched this piece of garbage again . , you did Field of ! What  s up with this ?

Only they still cant make it good . Well I thought this movie was pretty damn decent . Everything I came this movie . The were hilarious with each other . They were great when it came to their in the movie . The only thing i think they a little was the emotional part of their death . But I don  t know , I  m not in my and my is still alive . .

"This was a truly excellent movie . I was it to be a lot like the play , however I was truly ! It was great ! The was written in such a manner that everyone could relate men and alike . was excellent as . And what a great performance ( as usual ) from Cicely . The relationship and chemistry between the two of them was remarkable . Perry was phenomenal . I truly enjoy all of his and this was a delight to see on the big screen . What a great movie I , I cried , I was with all of while watching . Did anyone notice the resemblance between and ? They could be related in real life .",0
"I this movie for its crude humor . I make no for that , I like this sort of movie . I did not go in an Academy award winning movie , I crude , strange for he - , and total irreverence , and I came out satisfied . If you do not enjoy humor and some times in your face grossness then don  t even bother . Some of the I especially were the gigolo museum , and the scene with . This movie made me laugh , but I won  t pretend that it was a moving love story like  50 First  or a great comedy like some of the other Happy . A word of advice if you are going to see it in , I would ( and did ) see it at the half price showing . If you are something clean and sensitive look elsewhere . This movie is a lot than the first one , but still very enjoyable if you like that sort of thing . As a side bar all the were not at all difficult to look at . This movie was refreshing in that it did not take its self too seriously unlike most of today .",0
"Red Eye was such a thrill , edge - of - your - seat movie . You always want to know what ( ) will do next . Murphy is the perfect actor for this part , his charm to capture  s trust in the beginning of the movie , and turning his personality completely around . is great in the movie , every emotion in being wonderfully . Red Eye will truly show everyone that can do it all .. romance , comedy , thrill , drama ... the next big star .. AND from Canada !! Thats always a plus !! I don  t watch much of but after seeing Red Eye . i think i  go rent some of his ! All in all , if your looking to get a good thrill by watching a movie , go see Red Eye . Its worth it !",1
"Wow , stepping aboard another airplane at LAX will never be the same again after catching Craven  s tension filled RED EYE and feeling like a passenger in the seat behind the lovely and her monster of a fellow passenger in Murphy as they head to . a stunning performance , first , rather weak and timid , but as Murphy to terrorize her , you see that when she is , the strength of her character to the surface , and the fight aboard a very crowded plane , turbulence in the cabin , which up the tension on the screen . Nail biting time here . The plane ride is very real to any person who traveled today - surly flight , who lug too heavy luggage aboard , and in the midst of this is the plot which from Murphy , who with those incredible blue , just you in your seat . The film is action , the plane ride tense and frightening , which as a perfect backdrop for the story to advance , and the final on the ground lead to an exciting and finish . Kudos to Craven and the of the stunning , who from the beautiful love story , THE NOTEBOOK , to RED EYE , just up the screen . And be sure to check who is the passenger next to you on a future flight . If it is Murphy , my advice , change your seat .",0
"Yeah , , so you pretty much know how this movie  s going to end 5 in . Usually I  d say that  s a bad thing , but in this case it works . To steal a quote from  Firefly , the journey  s the part . This movie  s got in all the right , it  s got in all the right , and really  t the definition of suspense that you know what  s going to happen but the don  t ? I  read a few that trash the last 20 min , once the plane , as generic and thoughtless but I disagree . After 70 min of tension and suspense you * want * to see fight back and boy does she . If you want go see . If you want to be by a tightly composed suspense thriller go see  Red Eye .",0
"Spare me . This movie is well directed and well paced . The inner core of a man  s soul , a man  s , and what it will take for that man to reach these . But this movie , with all it  s awkward , awkward and awkward ........ just you to an awkward ending . So the man can feel again , so the man every young man is his son now . So what ? I was subdued for the ride in this movie . I the scene where he is standing outside his motel room in the early morning ...... listening and watching the world go by around him . Busy ....... but peaceful . The director the audience in so many ways with this film , but then flat on his face with an ending that is one of those  thought provoking  or  making his point . Just shut up already . End the movie with just that . An ending !! You develop likable and intriguing , don  t utilize them , and then end it with hokey pokey . Come on Bill , great acting , great story ......... but no direction . Slap the director next time and tell him to have some backbone and finish his movie the right way .",0
"This movie was one of the best that I have seen this year . I  t see any in the movie , but it is still pretty good . It is similar to in the humor department , but I think this is a better put together movie . It actually a point . If you are going to see a whole bunch of T & A you will be disappointed . Just a well put together movie !!!! If you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor , you will find this to be a really good movie . I definitely think that and  s review of this movie is right on . I mean , I don  t really like on most , but this is the movie that I will agree about . The movie a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there . There is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie . Yea , sure , you get at when it is found out about , but it still that you wait . did a wonderful job of the person that he did in this movie and yet , it is still funny .",1
"I to see this based on all the favorable . I have to remember in the future that most are male . A man might find the excessive vulgarity and profanity than I did . The 18 - 25 year old will undoubtedly love this film . This movie is rated R and it is about a 40 year old virgin , but funny  t mean four letter in practically every scene . To be honest , some of the male talk left me in the dark . I guess you have to be a guy to know the  guy speak . I was sharper dialogue , humor based more on observation . There are a few good one , but I wished for more . In the showing I saw , I imagine the 65 - 70 old woman in front of me was cringing a good deal of the time . Some made  me  uncomfortable . I  m guessing this movie will play better for men than most . , so good in  s show  the Office , is equally excellent here . I was at his range . He never seem , just a little out of the loop when it comes to . His performance the film . The supporting are all excellent . I wish they had been given less material . I still give this movie a up , but with , especially if you  re easily offended .",0
"Bill his facial expression only once that I can remember during the entire movie . He like a robot . Like Lost in Translation , his character from scene to scene , place to place , apparently only because his friend him to , and then he comes home , back in his suit and goes back to his apparently pointless life . It is not ever clear , and possibly only barely , that anything at all is in his mind or his heart . I take that back . Heart is barely . He like someone who been with throughout his body . An extremely boring movie .",1
"I would agree with most of the and say it is a B - movie , but it  s one of those great B - . Murphy is just brilliant in his role . His are great , he them with wit and overall creepiness . His big blue and the charm that out , hook you . I  m sure that this will be the film that him further to the top , though I wish he  d been discovered more through his , as they were also great . an aura about her that just you want to watch her all the time - as seen in The Notebook and Wedding . She convincingly but up and some girl power . In the end , I hope this movie does well because it to . It  s short but it  s engaging , especially with certain . The idea of the film is a good one , and it  s been done right in my opinion .",0
"My goodness is this movie bad . I was totally misled by my local movie review because this is certifiable garbage . Yeah , yeah , good wear white , bad wear black .... and the good always win . Now go home and hug your , and feel how good made you feel . ! I can  t believe this brain dead movie was made by Craven . I  m guessing he a little money to pay the mortgage , so he made this piece of dung . It is the sort of production that anyone who regularly believe they could do as good or better than such an experienced director . Ya see , a bad guy a sweet girl who her daddy to do a  bad thing or he  s hurt her daddy . But being . All - girl next door , we know she  s save the day and beat the bad ... the end . Girl power . C  mon now , only an idiot would find this entertaining ... a roller coaster ride , let alone something fresh or new .

Not a good performance , not a horrible one ... she  s just cute . She would have had to show a whole lot of skin to save this movie . She  t tough enough to be a good female action lead . Murphy was at least passable in 28 Days . But here he a dumb villain to be a smart one . He his ass to and fro by the 5  5  , because after all , she was a cheerleader ... and a field hockey player ... and I  m sure she all the Tae Bo ... so she should be able to kick the crap out of an international terrorist for hire . I  t trust him to steal a pack of gum from 7 - 11 . Ya see , this movie was done before , except before they did it well . Go re - rent any of the Die Hard . You have in danger , international , except the are more likable and believable and the bad are WAY more competent and interesting . I simply don  t understand how can continue to make such crap as if they were oblivious to the proper they can readily copy . No wonder movie are down . Throw your $ 6 down the toilet and save yourself 2 of your life you  never get back . ,",1
"I to luck out and see this movie on a  sneak peek  night , and I  m glad , because I would have been rather upset had I spent money to see this . I miss the days when Craven made that made my skin crawl . This film was very easy to predict , right down to the stabbing in the neck with the pen . The first part of the movie to drag a bit - you can figure out what  s up rather early on . I have to admit , I simply May  s character , ... she and her wide a giggle every time from me . The film also a lot of old over & over - wanting to kill a high  t official , with the classic shoulder rocket launcher . We get an impressive explosion - but remarkably , with no one getting off the floor , no on is . Save this one for a rental .",0

"STAR RATING : ***** The Works **** Just the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The ( Jet Li ) is a man who been raised from childhood to fight and maim like an animal . Once his electronic collar is removed by his  owner  ( Bob ) a vicious gangster into protection , he goes berserk and a brutal tirade of martial violence . Then one day , he to discover his true self and to question his reason for being . Then his owner is apparently after biting off more than he could chew with a victim who really  t want to pay up . Sam ( Morgan Freeman ) a kindly old Ray alike who him to play the piano , despite his blindness . He a side to his humanity and the true meaning of love and friendship . But all this can  t last forever and in time , old and unwelcome from his past return to wreak havoc on his present peace and well - being ... Unleashed finally been . I do remember that Steven had originally been billed to play Li  s role - , no , no , a very bad choice - Li was perfect for the role . Although the day I thought I  d ever see him and Morgan Freeman in a film together would be a cold day in hell , but then he did make his debut alongside Mel in Lethal Weapon 4 , so maybe this  t so surprising . , on the other hand , well , he should be grateful to be working with Li , not the other way round , that  s all I  say . more of Li  s usual work will at best be and at worst extremely disappointed with Unleashed . Although there is some appropriately brutal and intense MA in , a part of the film is devoted to the drama segment between Li and Freeman and him becoming accustomed to his life beyond the control of his brutal owner . This drama is very well and certainly you in for the most part of the film . The MA are actually a little disappointing . Although they  re undeniably intense and ferocious , there  s something about the and timing that just a little flippant and a bit too choppy to be considered among Lis best work ( although I will confess I haven  t seen many of his foreign .) Even the scene in which , axes and sharp , are used , although you feel the tension , you can  t admire the craftsmanship . Li less about his MA here and more concerned with coming across as a good actor ( possibly to be working alongside an acting great like Freeman and trying to play up to and impress him .) This behaviour was certainly evident at the film  s premiere ... The film an absorbing use of style and camera that should be , typical for a film genius . On the other hand , weighing it down are some unexplained in the script that fail to make sense . Why does the collar removed make Li react the way he does ? How he learned to use martial so effectively if he  s just been at a young age and raised by people with no apparent training in them themselves ? And why , when the film is set in , does no one talk with a accent ? But a large majority of of this type of film probably won  t care about those , there is some enjoyably tense action to be and it  s also a film that new for Li in of his development as an  actor  and not just a  martial star . ***",0
"This movie the same boring over and over again in a 5 minute loop . Yeah , I would have this when I was 14 , but those days are long gone . All I can say is that I am that anyone over the age of 14 actually this movie . Seriously , wow . This is an embarrassment to the world of comedy , reminiscent of Without A Paddle , and any movie ever made look like pure genius . What I thought would be funny for the first 15 of this movie turned out to be not only the first 15 , but the entire movie in a loop . No evolution of thought , character , or . Simply the same penis - garbage from one scene to another . So yeah , if you laugh every time you hear the word penis , go ahead and see this movie , otherwise look for a comedy with some thought put into it .",0

"This is my # 1 favorite movie of all time . It  s a must see ! This movie made me bawl so hard . The music is also really great too .

Usually romance on film never turn out to be good , considering that they are all mostly romantic - . This is a very good story and it a great plot .

The movie with the most random SONG I  ever seen . I thought since was involved it would reflect the comedic genius of the . . The good thing about the is they were so wonderfully random yet everything was together and it all made sense . Like the mention of he girl whose story it is  not  in the first chapter , or the bowl of . But it just comes off as stupid when you see it in the movie .

The one in which my multiplex it out during the most crucial part of the assassination scene !",0
"I hate to use that but this movie will grab your attention and not let go until it ! An enjoyable ride that off slowly then tension to a good effect . Although you do not learn too much history about the  bad guy  nor are the for the main plot point fully . This however may not be a bad thing since it leaves mystery and add to the suspense . Most of the movie place in the airplane and the way this is one uncomfortable and the story . Minor note , some shown in the trailer for this movie does not actually appear in the movie . The acting is great by both main and the story well to a  edge of your seat  if not predictable conclusion . This story is well told , and directed and I recommend it to anyone interested in a good end - of - the - summer thriller .",0
"Am I the only one who a movie by how I feel when I leave the theater . The movie itself might be imperfect , might have a few that drag on a tad , or are cut a bit short , but all in all the sharp on life color my own life when I leave the theater and stop and get an ice cream ; blueberry swirl on a regular cone perhaps , maybe some . We meet Don , and his family and the Don  known  ( real estate saleswoman , animal communicator , closet reorganizer and chick in sticks ) and mentally dissect the in which their individual are . It one think of their own life ( me at least ) and how we have a choice in the direction our are going and how it can lead to happiness , unhappiness or ennui . ( Some people might disagree with me and think the couple who sell real estate in the are happy , but they would be a little fruity now  t they .) And then we meet the hungry young man in front of the diner , with his sad angry and gruff manner , and I really want to get to know the guy , where he  s been , what  s he  s been through . We don  t get to , and neither does Don , and I think that is sort of the point . It was great to see Don come alive at the end , running after the that might be his son . Even if he  t get himself an instant on his road trip , at least he a desire to rethink the in his life , and direction he is going in . All in all a great film , a nice walk home , and some great ice cream :)",0
"I really this movie . It so much action , so much suspense , non - stop interest . And can be at so many . For one thing , this is just a good thriller . Full of heart - pounding excitement , scary , and turns . For another , if you like great characterization , I think is really just outstanding : she so many , so effectively , so convincingly . By turns she  s shy and flirtatious ; wistful and romantic ; and ; and ; and ashamed ; perceptive and ; crafty and insightful ; aggressive and persistent . Just a wonderful portrayal of a thoroughly engaging character . There  s an interesting sub - dynamic past victimization of  s character , that with the face value dynamics of present victimization ; and the way she works through both at the same time . There  s a wonderful historical dynamic that for a third dynamic : 9 / 11 . From the early entry of the Department of Homeland Security to the gradual unfolding of the primary : airport , aircraft , tall building . The evocation of 9 / 11 ... and post - 9 / 11 ... is everywhere , without being at all heavy - handed and without any trace of failure to dovetail neatly into the primary here - and - now plot unfolding in each of these . The way in which proceed the Victimizer in the present , the past Victimizer of , and the past Victimizer ( s ) of New York on 9 / 11 , is chilling and frightening and ( initially ) overwhelming . The character to the occasion , though , and clearly herself as Victim - No - More : something she explicitly at one point . The scene in the house is ( at one level ) a very familiar one in the annals of ; but in the sheer intensity and skill and aggressiveness and intelligence and commitment of the character as she clearly that Terror will not win over her ; or indeed over our country . I don  t want to give away the denouement , but the final scene with the - character and her would - be Victimizer is truly rich with that are human , authentic , and ( let it be said ) . What a wonderful movie ... this one I  probably have to go see again in ... and when it  s out on , I  m getting it , it  s a keeper .",0
"Red Eye , is about a young woman , who works at a big hotel . After a death in the family , is home on a flight . The flight is and before it is again she a man , who she to find charming and soon to like . They sit together on the flight once it re - and soon she out that he a lot about her and that there is a reason for this and if she does not help him in the killing of a wealthy executive then she and her father are in danger . I went into Red Eye , thinking that it would be a good thriller coming from director Craven , who directed some of my horror The Last House On The Left , The Have and A Nightmare On Elm Street . I was however really disappointed with Red Eye . The film  s two ( ) and Murphy ( ) both do a good job and the film  t badly made but the film  s script needs work . One of my about the film is that it is too short . It rushed and like we don  t get to know the that well and the more we would know about the and what was going on I probably would have it more . The film  t very thrilling or exciting and  t really start to pick up steam till the last ten or so . The film also somewhat and like nothing really new . Craven  s other film this year Cursed , was given terrible by but I quite it ( keeping in mind I saw the unrated version ) and I  t really like Red Eye , but that . Go figure . I hope for Craven  s next project he goes back to horror a genre he best and not try a poorly written psychological thriller like this one again .",0
"... it was sort of a waste of time . I really the show , and that show was made before I was born ! So imagine the disappointment . Well , I  m a fan , so I really like a story about and , but it  t quite what I thought . Then the plot was too simple , I thought it was down for , maybe the would feel .  s and  s were not put to good use , their were haphazardly , if at all . Will was good , amazed he his own with . was cute , too cute , like a child , but maybe they meant that . I  give them one thing : the movie was charming . It  s a feel good movie . BUt the ending was a bit twisted , won  t spoil it for you , but , I  m sure you  find the ending a bit twisted ... Good enough to be marketable , but ultimately a waste of time . I  d rather watch the original show , but it  s not so bad that you  d want to see ...",1
"Watched it last night . As go I  seen much much worse . The plot was thin in and some of it  t make a whole lot of sense particularly the deer scene . I suspect 98 % of the movie audience the writer and myself had no idea where that came from or where it was going . The boy toy in this film had one purpose and one purpose alone . To die . That  s it . Nothing more . I guess somebody had to or it  t have gotten that - 13 rating . And it  t very scary either . The first Ring was indeed more frightening . I don  t think I was truly afraid or once . I felt to watch this as I did like the original but that  s no excuse . The ending was fine with me at least that did make sense to me . me a little style not the typical just shoot the bad guy and he  go away ending . is lovely that  s a plus too but she  t do a heck of a lot either acting wise . Final Analysis : barely decent but could have been witty and clever .",1
"I guess this was one of the first disaster , at least in the air and i don  t know why i had never of it until it came out on . I don  t see why it had such a low profile among  s other since it is better then most of  s that i  seen . At first was only going to produce it and it to Spencer but ended up doing the part himself . Even though top billing it  s almost like he  t the main star , which works for this kind of film . There are some with the film like it being almost two and a half and they could of cut out some of the personal . This is one of  s best and should have a profile .",1
">>>>> <<<<<< this is a church movie - it got national release but this is a church movie geared to church going . So , I  m not going to comment on any of that . The thing that disturbed me the most was the  revenge  of upon her completely helpless husband . The she had to sink to to do that to a completely helpless person without remorse is astonishing . She left him completely immobile unable to do anything for himself , drink water for 2 days and when she got back did she feel remorse for what she had done or even slight dismay at her own behavior - no she then proceeds to dump him in a tub , which quite frankly if done the way she did it - he would have broken his neck . Then she virtually him think she is going to let him drown and then eats in front of him to punish him when he  t eaten for 2 days ... she is somehow the heroine at this point ? I  m sorry , he was a horrid jerk and abusive - but she topped him , she was depraved in her behavior and it me that it is over as if it meant nothing . She could have out on his abusive behind she to on her good two and for herself - he  t move enough to get himself a drink of water . Quite frankly the rest of the movie did not redeem that portion of it . That is my opinion - to which you are more than welcome to disagree but the  message  in the movie to me was lost after that . Especially since she truly did not show the abject remorse she should have felt for what she did . I had a woman kiss me that way ...  t make her my wife",0
"I thought that  Titanic  was wonderful . History and romance all rolled into one . did a marvelous job . and the is beautiful . I and i cried . This movie is the best to quote from and use in your everyday life . I live by these . was stupendous . A wealthy woman trapped in her own life is a difficult role to play . The romance was a great way to catch people  s attention . The way every little detail so that you could really understand the emotion and wonder in this production , was beyond me . if you are one of the that enjoy history , and a little romance you will surely enjoy this film .",1
"I first of the movie from my acting coach who gave it a up . So that night I rented it . Form the moment I put the in an hit play till the I could not look away from the screen . The film just me away ! The action , the , and the plot kept me at the edge of my seat begging for more . The story with Jeff Tally ( ) as a hostage negotiator in the mission and a young boy . A his wife and daughter to the small  low crime  town of . On one the typical quiet days three run into a rich and fallow her home on stealing her Father  s . Little do they know he does some questionable business . One thing to another and Jeff is forced to take control of the situation before his family is by the who need the rich Father  s information . The director who  s work I haven  t had the privilege of seeing successfully a perfectly enjoyable movie any movie fan would love . That and the skill each and every actor make this movie one of the best I  ever seen . So if you get a chance rent it you won  t be sorry .",0
"I this movie to be good , and it was better . It was excellent . From beginning to end , it was hilarious . Non - stop f - and sexual content is my kind of movie . Believe me , you wont be disappointed to see the 40 year old virgin . i cant really imagine a person who cannot like this movie . The waxing was awesome , and the scene was funny as all hell . Not really much else to say except , see it now ! Screw the other that just came out , especially the August 12th line - up . This is in the same category as Wedding to me , probably a little bit more but pretty damn close to the same . So , if you the Wedding , see this . It  s even 2 long , and those 2  t boring , every bit is f * hilarious ! 10 / 10",0
"This is the second movie to exceed my in the last few . The left me wondering whether this movie would be worth watching at all . Plus , I on the Daily Show , but I found his , but he was never the star . Here , he a writing credit . His are getting better as his expand . Much to my surprise , they it off after all , to an interesting , and unexpected after the which a significant element of sweetness to the story . The subject of the movie is more serious than the comedy this is billed to be . ( ) is the virgin because he  to be ; actually , because he  s socially inept and afraid of the opposite sex . I was wondering how he would break the news to his in the movie , who sex with him , apparently to avoid the pressure . The supporting cast is a hoot , the is well written , and entirely believable , as crazy as his - to be . We  all had them . I also the interesting choice of music , which an interesting layer to the movie one  t usually notice . Not the movie of the year , as some say , because it  t intended to be , considering the subject which to be dealt with seriously and not frivolously . It is good story with funny , and I highly recommend it .",0
"My Review : No film in memory ( mine at least ) had as high as Mangal . Mainly due to , which is quite unfair . , is a masterpiece in every way , Mangal is not a sequel , , or in any way shape or form related to . Therefore while it may be difficult , it should be at as its own entity . Mangal off with a blast and out engaging the audience . However most and alike have about the pace of the first half . I did not find this to be a problem at all , in fact I believe the first half is superior to the second . does a fantastic job as Mangal , as was of him . I wish he had spoken in a tone in the film , as I Mangal with a voice . Although that cannot be against him as very few take the risky plunge of slightly their voice . Toby is excellent as Mangal  s friend . His commitment to speaking as naturally as possible is evident throughout the film . and Toby have great chemistry and are quite believable as best of . Patel surprisingly did not go overboard in the film , and was happily part of the back - story . Rani does an acceptable job as the prostitute , although she really needs to work on her emotional crying . The rest of the cast also does a great job . The only acting I have are that most of the did not seem to put as much effort into speaking as did . The direction and of the film were very questionable . The film a very amateur , and is it by FAR the biggest flaw in the film . The and are all sloppily together , completely messing with the flow of the story . The are downright unnecessary and the film would have been much better without it . The story , and the feel of the start to get into your mind , and then all of a sudden comes a song and you right back into reality . On the topic of music , the background score of the film also is not very well done . It does not flow well with the film , often with the in of . Where there should be aggressive music , there is a mix of heroic and happy music . It just  t help the film for the most part . Despite all the in and direction , Mangal is still an enjoyable watch . It at a pace than most , and that may be a turn off for most movie as they are accustomed to redundant love or nonessential action . However , I believe that a movie does not need to be fast paced to be engaging . to and the cast and crew ( save the director and most especially the editor ) for making a film of such scope for cinema , even if it does not live up to it  s unbelievably enormous ( but then again , could anything ever live up to those ??). Definitely worth a watch , go and see this film . 7 / 10",1
"**** please note - I tried really really hard to figure out how . his first name . I found both and all over the place , but no  official  actor  s web page . I  chosen to use in this review ... i guess because I think it  s cooler . No disrespect is intended . At least , not in the spelling ( or misspelling , as the case may be ) of his name .*** Well ... I to like it more than I did . Every time I was just getting into its groove ... Victor would show up . Huh ? Who is this actor and why is he on my screen ? Who would be afraid of this goof - ball ? I can  t remember the last time I felt an actor was so over his head in a role . The floor - eating scene ... am I the only only one who said to myself ,  If I were in that room , I would have made him wipe up that mess he made on the floor , washed his potty - mouth with soap , then his little butt for being too big for its and sent him to his room ! Victor Sweet is supposed to be this incredibly powerful underworld commander ... an Overlord of Evil , even . I like the role , and I love the fact that casting selected a relatively unknown actor . I just think it was the wrong actor . He came across ... immature . He fell so flat ; there was no sincerity , nothing real behind it . Just some goofy guy that the were following because he them mildly of . I kept the of the his going something like this : Singleton : . CUT . hair and : , , THAT WAS GOOD , LET  S DO IT AGAIN . BUT THIS TIME , CAN I GET YOU TO DO A LITTLE MORE ... UM ... SOMETHING ? ( CONFUSED ): I AM DOING SOMETHING . I  M BEING VICTOR . : UM , YEAH . LET  S SEE A LITTLE MORE OF THAT . CE : HUH ? : WELL , VICTOR A PERSONALITY . WHAT KIND OF PERSONALITY DO YOU THINK HE ? CE : HE  S ENIGMATIC . I  M BEING ENIGMATIC . : YES , . HE IS Definitely ENIGMATIC . BUT UNDERNEATH THAT , HE  S A REALLY BAD GUY . REALLY BAD . VICIOUS . EVERYBODY IS OF HIM BECAUSE THEY NEVER KNOW WHAT HE  DO NEXT . HE  S BOILING OIL UNDERNEATH THAT COOL EXTERIOR . CE : HE  S ENIGMATIC . : YES , BUT BOILING OIL UNDERNEATH . CE : I  M BEING ENIGMATIC .( AT ) CE , STARING BLANKLY : ENIGMATIC CE , STILL STARING BLANKLY , MUTTERING AND WALKING AWAY : OH , DEAR GOD , WHAT HAVE I DONE ? CE , CALLING AFTER HIM : ENIGMATIC ?!?? AND ... SCENE . Like I said : I the movie . Go see it . Just don  t attach a powerful identity to Victor , because you  be disappointed if you do . Pretend the part is being by someone else . I actually may get it on , then cut out little of another actor ( ANY other actor !) and edit them into all of  s place ... any ?",0
"I saw the movie Mangal yesterday and the are still quite vivid in my mind . I attribute this to the wonderful cinematography and the canvas that to unfold the story before his audience . The madness in Mangal  s , roughly as  , can only be by a great actor . A . R .  s music is so good that it can make your hair stand on end . The four story atop an elephant visiting as they tell their story is a great narrative technique . The of the film in the film media me . I fail to understand the motive or even the thought process behind them unless it is that we are all in the danger of to cheap cynicism when or of patriotism come up in a creative form . People have about the colour and the song and dance that used . I believe this is because of two -- one is that a background and this is a part of folk - to use music and dance to convey . The other reason is that in a movie dealing with the tragic of brave it is important to to provide some kind of relief . Even the presence of the two which been , is important to give the feel of the time . Mangal had to be shown as a real living human being not some flat lifeless character unearthed from dusty history . One of the female brought to light the repugnant of whereas the nautch girl was used to depict the presence of pleasure for the company . Both are necessary to give us a realistic picture of that era . A comment was made elsewhere that the younger found it hard to connect with the historical character . Is it easier , then , for the youth of modern to connect with and reality with no content ? And if this is so then does it not become even more important for our film to produce with real content that may inspire pride in our culture and history ? Mangal is a great film . From the first scene to the last you can see the immense amount of hard work that gone into its making . The only thing that was the voice over provided by Om . It was unnecessary . I think the movie great .",1
"I  m put it like this , for those who haven  t seen Guess Who  s Coming To Dinner , plain and simple ... WATCH THAT MOVIE FIRST AND LEAVE IT AT THAT !!!!!! The in Guess Who  s Coming To Dinner brilliantly , it  s a CLASSIC film . Not only was it HILARIOUS , it was very touching and real as well . Sadly , 38 later , they had the nerve to remake a classic comedy like Guess Who  s Coming To Dinner and reverse racial . Guess Who . was far from hilarious . First off if you saw the original , you never saw in the same bed as Spencer , nor in the same bedroom for that matter . Guess Who was the opposite . In the original , all the met . In Guess Who , only what his and grandma said about his future . never ever with his and then had the nerve to be desperate and sing horribly to get her back ( not to mention make 35 cell phone ). The most distasteful thing about Guess Who was the fact that they had to make a bunch of racial with the black laughing . There was only one instance in Guess Who when the N - word , but that was once . The fact is Guess Who was the WORST movie Mac ever starred it and it  s a poor excuse for a remake . Guess Who  s Coming To Dinner was a classic , pure , hilarious comedy without all the filth and sex - related humor , Guess Who was the opposite , PLAIN AND SIMPLE and that  s it , ENOUGH SAID !!!",1

"The Fact that many People compare this Movie with the Matrix is quite wrong . The Story nothing to do with the Matrix . The only are that in Equilibrium there are also , but that  s it .  Performance is better in an emotional way , because we follow him throughout the movie and see him becoming another man than before ( i don  t want to spoil to much ). That is the main Point of this Movie . while the Matrix more on the world around . Of course we follow Neo ( ) but in the Matrix the change of the world and how Neo at it is more important . Just want to say , that the Matrix  Plot is quite more interesting but  Plot is much more emotional . Still that  t mean  Plot is weak , it  s good and well ! Still both have great and Action in it . Both are great ! Equilibrium itself as an , extremely cool but also emotional and well movie , which is fun to watch . 8 / 10",1
"Similar to the ideal behind  Kill Bill : Vol . 2 ,   is not your typical revenge drama . As a matter of fact , until one the film in its entirety one will not know of the fact that the revenge does not belong to the protagonist but rather to the antagonist . A statement in the review before mine that   does not have a  meaning , that its ending is not satisfactory ( when to  Seven ,  Memento , and  The Sixth Sense ). Those two are not  revenge , they are trend that work entirely on atmosphere and that their do not necessarily need to be important . Memento  s ending is flawed because you don  t know whether is a faker , himself , or not and whether what Joe is true .  Seven  had a message brought forth by a lunatic monster and after his surrender , the ending was not  important , but rather a balancing act between insanity and brilliance .  The Sixth Sense  s ending you like a punch and the audience because who  character REALLY is is inconsequential to the story of the boy who to . Also is a quote by Morgan Freeman ; but to honest ,  The world is a beautiful place and worth fighting for . I agree with the second part . is a quote from . is visceral and brutal but is also bold and insightful as to the fact that although you have had harm done unto you do not try and seek revenge by murder or vigilance . Try your best to understand WHY the terrible occurrence had to you and what you can NOW do to fix it . That is the ideal , the  point  of   and it been wonderfully .

"After seeing  The  I found myself wondering if I truly a film about the joke in the world . The answer : Almost . The film itself around a single premise : A joke with the punch line  The ! for a long time , and many different tell their and try to explain why the joke is funny , reflection on what this particular joke so memorable and humorous . Don  t get me wrong . There are of this movie where I was difficulty breathing due to the humor and the telling of  the joke . Some of the were flawless , executed with the aggressiveness and impartial judgment that have made some famous . But some I  t find funny . And their telling of  the joke  another feeling inside me : How much longer is he going to try to make me laugh ? And the problem here is that these of the movie are just very difficult to sit through . foul language and to numerous is one thing , but it to listen to a comedian do it badly . Ultimately , the do a good job of explaining some of the finer of  the joke , comedy in general , and its place in our . But the film more time on each  angle with  the joke  than the development of why the joke is great . And I think the movie from it . Listening to the philosophy of  the joke  was great ; listening to bad preach the scripture was unbearable . So the dilemma was : I thought I the film afterward , but I  t know . After careful deliberation , I gave it a 7 , losing 3 through the lack of more comedic philosophy and for the sometimes painfully unfunny a movie like this in it .",1

"This should be my kind of movie . Even if it , it still should have been right up my alley ; hell , I like  , and  Allan  . I have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien / demon / adventure . Let  s go over why I decided to watch this in the first place . 1 . Horror / - fi almost always me 2 . I  m a big fan of archaeology , and this movie does involve a rare treasure . 3 . Super - natural with quality . 4 . Slater and I generally enjoy . 5 . Tara is hot . So this movie had potential , at least in the cheese - horror section of the video store , but boy did it suck ass . The only are Slater and , and not everyone them as entertaining as I do ... I mean , let  s face it , both are melodramatic . But now on to some of the many . Tara . Even though the movie as a whole is worse ,  s performance is truly awful . We  re not just talking bad , I  m talking about Tara for worst performance of the year . I don  t know if she is capable of acting , but the museum curator is simply out of her league ... completely . Watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist  t much different than what you get watching the setup in bad . I mean this  t just bad , it is laughably bad . Oh , and for those of you curious , she  t get naked , only down to a bra in a silly , totally unnecessary love scene . Even with  s performance , perhaps the movie could have worked , but the plot is what , and the plot written by a 10 year old . I  t this was a video game adaptation until AFTER watching the , otherwise I would have the stupidity in real - time . The back and forth from Slater  s childhood at an where he of something terrible that , he amnesia , of course . In his adult life Slater was by some Unit 713 , a paranormal military force that apparently evil or something . Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious , I guess , you never really know unless it was in one of those voice - I zoned out during . The movie with Slater hunting , his latest piece after some with a  mercenary force in selling rare . I may have the exact quote wrong , but you get the idea . There is an evil doctor that to unleash some on earth ( no reason given ), on , super demon / alien - human ,   ( the demon can  t stand sunlight ) and , of course , Slater and to try to save everyone . , I can  t even being to wade through the . The script badly to narrow the focus and provide SOME depth . I mean , why is this evil scientist so damn evil ? Oh right , are and he is just trying to save the human race . I guess he  s infected ? How did that happen ? Oh right he one of the evil demon in a cage and its blood to shoot into himself . How the hell did that happen ? Why and where did he get the super ( oh yes , they use the old - fi stand by of parasitic / which  fuse  with the spine of their host ) Of course , Slater is , like Blade , half super - slug powered , but his slug   t fully fuse due to an electrical shock , thank god . Oh , and the people with these  fused  , have no idea they  re half - alien / demon and act as good of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer . Yeah we get . So lots of crap that could be entertaining , but none of it is . Also , the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place ... at least nothing a little dynamite can  t handle . Not the very worst thing you  see , but a truly bad movie .",1
"Chow once again that he  s the master of the Kung Fu comedy flick . I haven  t been this in a movie since the last time I sat in the back row . Not content to use any basic , help from the legendary Hung and Ping . These two of the genre deliver the martial fight I  seen from any movie . their choreography with astounding special effects and beautiful camera . The wire acting is flawless and seamlessly with the . But this  t just a boring action flick ! The script is chock full of sight and slapstick . Even the action comes with a side - serving of humour . The are over - the - top of Kung Fu - the fool , the evil villain , the mysterious assassin , the serene master - and are to perfection by the cast . This movie is pure entertainment from beginning to end . should start paying attention - THIS is what are all about .",1
"This review is not meant to edify the reader  s knowledge of what actually place in the movie . It is merely meant to advocate the legitimacy of this film as a rare comedic stand - out in an era when care more about the financial bottom - line than actually engaging their . At a time when the film industry is treating its like do their , it is refreshing to have been able to view a movie that does not sacrifice quality nor demean my intelligence by to conventionally uninspired adult humor . This film is well thought - out and will probably do a tremendous amount of business because it was well - as opposed to the - , formulaic soft sell approach of most comedic today . As a 32 year - old , it was also refreshing to watch a film who are my age - , as opposed to another flaccid youth - teen movie . The fact that also - wrote and executive - produced this movie not only  The 40 - Year Old Virgin  a tremendous personal achievement , but its artistic success , as well .",0
"This movie is so wrong on many . The gun violence is so over the top it on stupidity . Every cop in the country should revolt against this movie , it them as stupid , corrupt unprofessional and ineffective . The are gun , drug taking , lawless , , with no except grief for their down mother . The movie place in this make belief world , , where all the people are in their watching and these four run the world . At one point in the movie the corrupt cop out of a bar full of people with his cop partner , his partner then to act like there is another person there who actually did the shooting , on his radio and he needs backup and his gun next to the radio for effect . All this is done without one person coming out of the bar to see what is going on or anyone coming to all around the shooting . This is an ugly anti social movie .",0
"This movie was extremely bad , not in of actually making the film ( acting , cinematography , , ). The movie was extremely poor in the quality , portrayal , and meaning of the story . The movie could have been so much better without all of the meaningless curse . Of course , this is a rated R feature , and I can see that they were pushing it to be rated R , but a lot of the and various pornographic and that were put in there , did not need to be used either . It that this movie was made just to do that , to put all of those that did not need to be there . I will hand this to them , the movie was funny in some , I really did laugh ... but most of it was just sick and bad content . I was really disappointed because I knew that this movie was from the producer of and I thought that was a really good , classic comedy . This was too , because it in a wedding , however , it just very strange when watching it and I really do not recommend going to see it . This movie still could have been funny without all of the curse and pornographic in it .",0
"like I wrote in my summary : I  t like the movie because it was too long - winded . if it would have a duration time of about 1 hour and 45 I would have probably given it a 8 or higher . it  s the same with the other of this trilogy , all were too long . I think I the first one the most because of the new and a relative fast . I never read the book , maybe that  s why I was watching this movie .... I have had a discussion with a friend once , he it very much , he gave it an 9 or 10 but he read the book , he told me that it was a great translation to the big screen , I can  t compare it in that way . action , atmosphere creation and were excellent though !",0
"This film is great in its scope of that it upon . This film is very similar to and , Ice Storm and Six Under ( among ) in its treatment of so -  bad  or  dark  like death , suicide , and insanity . Its also funny which it from being totally morbid . is a young genius in his ability to write and direct a film that such a great story that so many of mystery and revelation to it . The sense of place ( home ), location ( New Jersey ) as well as the use of an awesome . The of these are honest and raw . It is a film for this current generation like The Big Chill , The Breakfast Club and Less Than Zero were for past . The cast is superb . Portman that she is the best actor in her age group . Peter that he is perfect in allow him to be engaging and frightening simultaneously ( see Glass ). Dowd is good in the supporting role of the bizarre head of a bizarre family . And Holm is brilliant as usual . This film out in sharp contrast to any film made in the last few . I highly recommend watching this movie , it and the .",0

"The , the hilarious documentary directed by , and produced by , among , , is one of the about stand up comedy , period ! . was able to amass some of the best of this typical form of entertainment in which the classic joke is by whoever to be on the screen at any given moment . , this film is not for everyone who might object to be a witness a gross joke being told the way it  s supposed to be told . It  s a credit to . and everyone involved in this project not to stray from the joke itself in all its exaggerated detail . The  is an excellent documentary that will be by all of comedy . The film is laugh riot because it comes out naturally with what to be an improvisational style . The joke being told for our benefit by some of the best talent today in this country .",1
"This is the movie all dream of , a comic performance that can make them a movie star . That is what 40 Year Old Virgin is to . Not only is the film hilarious it a good spirit this is missing from most sex . This movie a message and it you feel good . This is more than a gross out comedy . The problem with a lot of adult is there is no soul , this movie i the heart . I and I want to see it again and again . Another highlight of this film is the wonderful supporting cast , Rudd and Keener are in particular very strong . However , the entire cast is a fabulous ensemble . I highly recommend this film to everyone . I believe this is the movie that will showcase just like with Martin in the Jerk and in Ace . I have suddenly become a huge fan !",0
"Very interesting and factual account of the last days of the Third , is magnificent as the and all the other are top notch . I am a WW2 buff and this movie comes very close to the actual that during those last dark days in the Berlin bunker . Seen the of , ( the real a scene at the opening and close of the movie )  s secretary during the last 2 1 / 2 of the , we get to see first hand of  s world down around him . The film us all the happening in the bunker poisoning her 6 and  s last minute marriage to . This film is a brilliant piece of work and a must see for anyone interested in WW2 .",0
"First of all , I have not seen this movie and do not intend to . I was a State Trooper for some and I am an resident . This guy was well known up here as a nut case and a danger to the he thought he was protecting . He lied about his to his family , saying he was fighting off people trying to harm and hunt the . I have seen of the movie and from the the around him were taking they were very and it  s a wonder he  t long before he was . This guy got what was coming to him , it  s just a shame he had his with him . If you do see this movie just remember , was more of a threat to these than you can possibly imagine . By being around them the way he was , the become accustomed to being around people . When and people are in close proximity someone usually up being , and it  s usually the bear for safety .",1
"The 40 Year Old Virgin in pretty much a of Brick from . the first 30 or so of the movie were about the least funny in any comedy i  seen in ( i say * in * because for some reason i watched  Guess who  on ... and that whole movie was pretty much the least funny comedy i  ever seen ). The whole movie was filled with nothing but poorly written , uncreative , and vulgar cheap . i . e . the old guy rambling on about sex . nothing remotely witty about it . in all i  d say the last half hour or so and the waxing scene were the only worth seeing . there was a small amount of funniness throughout that barely kept the movie going along at a decent pace . but in all , this certainly  t the best comedy of the summer . the humor in it is supposed to be shocking or whatever ... but saying : sh - t , fu - k , pus - y , - k , b - , . really  t shocking to anyone outside of high and . in summation ... it is a movie full of cheap and uncreative to the bone , but a few make it worth it if you  re really and hard up for a laugh .",0
"Just a bit of forewarning , this review is going to include . After watching this movie , I found that the movie marketing industry is going downhill , as all of my for the movie were right . For example , when a movie titled  FOUR , and you see the and of Mark , , and Benjamin , it becomes natural to assume one of two : a .) Garret ( the fantastic actor who the fourth brother ) , or b .) Someone in the whole movie making process to preview process can  t count . The former of the two would be the accurate one . The movie also a lot of open , such as what was so bad about these that they  t get a home elsewhere ? The movie does a little development of character for each of the , mostly on present development , giving very little to the past . The acting on the other hand was awesome . Mark always does good as a leading man and his reputation with this movie . , who is an actor from the past 9 , the stereotypical role you  d expect to see someone of his stature , in other , the guy who is pimping the girl and running around shooting . Benjamin the more successful of the and did a fine job at the feel of someone who out bad but then turned right , making character towards a rough past , but standing as a firm family man . Garret does , in my opinion , his best job yet , being a very new actor on the scene , showing through consistently noted childhood trauma through an emotional , almost , face , as well as a very human character who is used to getting picked on and just with it ( as many people do ). The plot is good , it sense , much more than most that are made these days . It the story of likely . It does carry its brief surrealistic used for cinematic , but the majority of the actually are a possible reality for some people to go through . Altogether , I  d say this was an to Good movie , not something I would bother seeing twice , but one I might consider when it comes out on .",0
"While giving this film a 4 / 10 , I have to make certain . If what you have come for is a double helping of playfully gratuitous violence with a refreshingly illiberal side of misogyny , then , odds are ,  Four  is for you . Nevertheless , to enjoy this movie , to disregard plot - that are too numerous to count and bland , amateur acting across the board . Then again , what can you expect from a film whose three main were initially famous for their music , and modeling really gay - looking underwear at Times Square ? It  s also worth that is a uniquely dilapidated , depressing place . In a better  Four , this circumstance would have for an interesting relationship between the cinematography and the plot . In the one were we are by the studio , it just everything dark , snowy and , for lack of a better word , - looking .",0
"I  d have this movie more had it on the tremendous mission , rather than the . As such , I found it to drag . I don  t need to see by the six times to know that they are the bad here . , I get it already . The action are great , but only for the six or seven they are on screen . Had it been more about the great and that those , I  d have been more . After all , it was the Great RAID , not the Great Imprisonment , and so I had that expectation . So a little less  s List / Papillon was . You can  t make a movie in the vein this to be without forcing to those two , and this movie is not engaging in that capacity . It a little more Band of . The love interest to me  t belong in a true story . In fact , the entire resolution of that plot line was unfulfilling and a letdown . I could be wrong about its veracity but it like they took some and tried to mold it into that part of the story ... please leave that for on the - Fi Channel . Stick to what really . Indeed , every part of the movie that was true was exciting . Every part they had to make up was trite or boring .",0
"I read several of this movie before I went to see it , and was just not prepared for how incredibly the language was , how incredibly the were , . I can see how it could have been a wonderfully touching , funny movie , if the language  t been so just plain awful . ( Sexual language that , if I tried to warn you of what I mean , the would not allow me to put it in writing !) The only reason I am writing this review is to let know : UNDER NO LET YOUR SEE THIS MOVIE ! However , perhaps you as should watch it to see what is wanting your to see ( to emulate ). Frankly , I  m it was just an R rating .",0
"I am just writing this because I believe this movie is . I found it to be very scary , with an interesting story and good . Maybe some people want to see see body flying all over all the time , , this film is more subtle . Not much gore , but menace . Of course you will find plot if you look for them but which film does not have them ? I recommend everybody to give this film a fair chance ; I am not easily but this film me out . a few to fill the ten a few to fill the ten required9 / 10 .",1
"This movie obvious in plot logic . However the viewer is not by this , even if it does make the film seem older than it is . Maybe because it is basically a remake of 451 . There are some interesting in there , the gun theory I found it to be cool . As in 451 a law enforcer to find works of art and destroy them along with any people that refuse to take the drug that them not feel anything . In the end he becomes a  feeler  and the resistance overthrow the government . I think the were awesome , maybe they those in Matrix . The well . The plot was both reminiscent of the 451 idea and also original in some of the . I to see people being by emotional in a world that is supposed to not feel . I the way the main character always had his on him , even when he was supposed to have been and relieved of his . All in all it was a very good movie , but it could have been better with a little more patience and maybe a higher budget . A must see for all Matrix :)",0
"This is a very good thriller that a watch , It  s best that you know as little about it as possible , so I won  t give any . Bale is superb in this , his physical state is remarkable , especially when you consider he had to put all the weight straight back on and get into shape for Batman . It  t overshadow his acting though and I  m that he never got a look in during the season . After all a gimmick . The cinematography is very nice and dark and the plot you guessing , you to figure it out rather than being flung around and confused . Director Brad credit for not trying too hard to impress and surprise , he it out to a natural conclusion that everything together . Give it a try if you  re looking for a dark thriller that you think .",1

I do not want to describe a scene or give away any part of the story because I might be accused of being a spoiler . My point is to inform my that finally a film from that us back to the golden era of , when like , when like and , when like Guru touched our hearts and our .

I watched the movie the of weird ( i have watched some on ) This movie woke us up . Me , my lady and many other and the movie . The music was weird at the start but i found myself shaking my head at the . i get me a from soon . The movie  t at all . the whole thing was in though i  t catch some of the minor actor  s language at times but my lady did . The story is about the suppression . it  t a  west  movie as i was afraid of - just the opposite . most important is that i had no idea about the story . it is an important part of history and so is good to watch .

"I went to this movie with very high , and they were met and . I don  t believe I have ever had such and had them met like that . I left the theater drained , exhausted , . I have never felt this way after a film . I hope its this way for the new viewer . I can  t think it will be quite as , but I hope the are . And people leave with something special . I know I did . This film it all . The most believable , a cast you will fall in love with . And even though it is far from a comedy , it will make you laugh out loud . Then there is the plot and action . Now , you do have to pay attention , but you will be if you do . This is not written for the weak at heart . If you want mindless entertainment you are in the wrong spot . . you can have space , gun , and a plot !!! Even a message for the people and the . I saw the version that did not have special effects and it did not detract at all . Same with the , and with the that just the , action and filler brought out . Well once we have a , it will be even unbelievable . Its not a pretty future , but there is hope , and it is believable . Joss took me out of the theater and put me on the crew of Serenity for 2 . I felt their fear , pain , love , shock and elation . I truly was not cognizant of my surroundings . I had one of the of the film sitting about 10 behind me during my screening . I forgot he was there within 10 . And I really on watching  s . And just to comment on the acting job of our big . Well , as the all know it was superlative . But , if you are not familiar with the Firefly  verse ( go buy or rent the !), I feel , top go to , and Summer . Again , all did a wonderful job , I would give to all . But those three had the material and were able to emote , without going over the top .  s portrayal of a Soldier woman was spot on . , brought all the anguish of the loss of the , to his future fight for survival , his care for his ship and crew and his need to do the right thing . Summer just brought a vulnerability to her character , that could have been a one note character , with a lesser actress , or script . The love of the cast for this project and each other was not just acting , it shown through and this film something special . If this does not get Joss and family some major recognition , then I am giving up on !!! I know it is too much to ask the academy to accept a film for best movie , or director , or script . But this is worthy material . Not just for Joss , but many of the cast deserve the little statue . I would give them to all if I could . Jewel , , , , Alan and gave stellar , they just  t have as much air time this time . But when we get our next movie , all are off . I also got to see the finished version at comic con , even better !! The added a lot . No major , just some . it even more .",1
"The main problem with this film is the lack of chemistry between the two who never convince that there is any true feeling between them . The script is also to blame since they never get to say anything to each other but meaningless of dialogue . Compare with the masterly  Before Sunrise  and  Before Sunset  where you believe in those and in their mutual affection . The party were also lame ( the seem to be a cool breed and yet we , the audience , never were to enter to enter their world as the main patently did ) and the one joke ( hey let  s take the p * out of the !!) soon to tire and appear quite offensive . The hypocrisy of the ( being sweet to their while angling for sex ) was also a great turnoff ( as if was not for me in  Before Sunset ) simply because we are never given the chance to feel any warmth for this pair of . All in all a good idea badly executed .",0
"A spectacular film based on Mangal  s part in the 19th - century Army Sepoy  s revolt against the East Company by wholly fictional , there is no historic record to support the most brutal . It is to be that in history which some will now think to be truthful . Setting truth aside , this is a fun film to watch , the acting is good , the is good , the song and dance , while essential to all , are unaccustomed to a Western audience . The are extravagant with and , the army as red as red can be . could have reduced the length of the film without loss to the story . Overall worth seeing , not worth seeing twice .",1
"I  watched every episode of this show so far , and I  m very . On the one hand , I think the are very well written ( except for the black guy who  s an * * that guy  s so racist they might as well have had him by a white man in black face ), I think the drama is good , I think it something about the nature of war , and think it  s a very good show on the whole . There  s just one problem . What it  s saying about is a TOTAL AND COMPLETE LIE . Now , don  t get me wrong . I  m a big old liberal . I this war . My . I was raised Orthodox , it  s in my blood to hate war . However , I don  t believe in just blatantly lying . I have two over in , one in the Army , one in the . They both say this show is totally inaccurate . The Roadblock Duty episode would never have , they the treatment of that prisoner as if it were policy ( for all of you who are about to scream Abu , that was not our policy ), and as for the first episode , no soldier would ever be thrown into combat that quickly . Also , beyond all this , it  s in EXTREMELY bad taste to do a show about a war already in progress . It  s just not right . There  s no way whats going on over there completely , because NO ONE ever that about a war until later . Any of you ever seen M * A * S * H ? That show place in . It was during . Anyone with half a brain that it was about , not , but the people doing the show had the good sense and common decency to set it in . This meant they could pretty much have whatever they happen , because the war was over 20 ago , and they  t be insulting any current military men . I am anti - war , but I  m not anti - military . This show is a slap in the face to anyone in the military right now , and it  s shameful . If you want to do a film about the Middle East conflict , I  got an idea . Why don  t you make a show about the Middle East in World War One . You know , the time when and went in and divided up the whole area , all the that exist today ? The time when we the whole area as our war prize and chopped it up into like a pizza ? You know , the basic reason why this whole mess been going on for the whole twentieth century ? THAT  S something should see . It would give the much more freedom ( there  s like only a dozen World War One that are still alive ) and it would give insight into the , something this show  t do at all . Like I said in the title , this is why we have allegory . So you can talk about the IDEA of a war and the in a war without talking about the war itself . So , to sum up , Over There good writing , good , and good drama , but it is totally inaccurate , a slap in the face of our , and it is in extremely , EXTREMELY bad taste . , shame on you .",1
"I  always good acting ... Day Lewis in  My Left Foot , in  Primal Fear , Rush in  Shine , . Eye - opening , knock - out acting in cinema is rare ... Shah in  , in   and aside from a few ( Khan as  ) good acting was non - existent in commercial cinema . ENTER KHAN !! He always was a good actor in my opinion ... some of his previous work is brilliant but there was still that big divide between commercial and  art  cinema in those days ( 1947 Earth ,  ). His performance in this movie though was very different .... Maybe because of the role , maybe it was the direction , but i strongly suspect it was the acting - IT  T KHAN ON SCREEN ! It was someone else ... actually , IT WAS MANGAL IN PERSON !!!!! His presence on the screen was something that me ... I  m not talking about a  Ka  type presence .... this was something else ... here , the viewer his character just by watching the guy on screen ! Khan was ... ABSOLUTELY AMAZING ! The best actor in without any hesitation ! Heck , he was better than many of my too . To be honest , the movie left me 10 % dissatisfied ... I was to see another good  period  depiction ( like  1947 earth  where one  s actually into that era ). did a fabulous job , but it could have been better - some more  real life  imagery ( like the sitting around in the town square and chatting in 1947 Earth ). Did it matter that the  background  score could  eve been better ? ( sure it  t  s score ... the song   on the other hand is nothing short of genius ) Did it matter that some of the graphics were sub - par ? Did it matter that some of the work ? ... NO , NOT AT ALL !! Khan  s acting more than made up for it ... By far the best actor there is ! If you haven  t watched it yet ... GO WATCH IT ! Its a movie of epic and one of the top 5 from Cinema of all time !************* WATCH THIS MOVIE !!***********",0
"The movie  s about what you would expect from reading the title : a short running length , and a pretty large variety of gross - out ( some of them quite creative actually ). It goes without saying that this is meant to be and pointless , and while it on those two , you should wait for it to come out on video . Not exactly  run - to - the - theater  material . Some of the work , but a lot of them fall flat . There  t much of a story here , just a thin semblance of a mystery to on . Not that there  s anything wrong with that -- but it just  t work as well as you might hope . This is potty humor through and through , . Don  t go in much else .",0
"I was a big fan of  s and Royal , but Life Aquatic was pretty average . Its are pretty easy to pick out . The film is too long and predictable , and not very exciting . The dark humor and drama from  s works are missing . The in the movie  t seem to have much of a motive ( except that there would have been even less story without them someone for the crew to rescue ), and there were too many ( why was Jeff even in this movie ?). The one thing a movie like this would have had going for it was the laugh department , but sadly , it  t deliver much there . There was a lot of potential in this flick , but in the end , it  t amount to much . I  t really recommend it unless you  re a die - hard fan .",1
"I cannot believe all the this movie received . Except for the acting , which was totally brilliant , I was as to how bad this movie was by the first five into it . This is the worst movie I have seen since 13th Warrior . First , throughout the whole movie there are totally rude and degrading about 8th grade . As if that were the worst job in the world . Well , I  t like most of my , but I see as an adult , that the teaching of is the most noble of all . Why this movie would go out of its way to disrespect them , I have no idea . is a man so horrible that he money from his own mother . His best attribute is that he is self - . For that character , its a good attribute , because he is an alcoholic , thieving liar . Jack , the other main character of the movie , is also scum . He is a liar and a disgusting womanizer . Days before his marriage , his only goal is to shag anything that , without a care for his . This movie is so totally unrealistic . Why would a beautiful and confident woman like Maya date a pudgy , depressed moron like ? How is this movie supposed to inspire us ? What are we to learn from this ? That are fragile and hopelessly weak ? Are we to learn that stealing from family and ruthlessly breaking hearts is ? Avoid this movie , unless you accept living with   is acceptable .",1
"I first saw after hearing about it from my sister - in - law . My wife and I subsequently went out and bought the Director  s Cut because the theatrical version was so good , but a bit in . The Director  s Cut up some of the loose in the theatrical version , and leaves you with even more wonder and love for this movie . Trying to describe this movie is quite difficult , but suffice it to say that it  s a dark , satirical look at today  s society , growing up , and mind all rolled into one little movie .

This is not the comedy ever made , but luckily it still some on offer they don  t like to acknowledge . The humor is in the line of a comedy tradition by Fried Chicken , later used in Airplane ! ( there is a direct reference here with the announcement of the red and white ) and the Naked Gun - series and of course - . The idea is you throw in that many there will always be some for someone . does the rest and you need of course a large audience willing to laugh for more than one hour . Its humor is overall crude and politically incorrect ( but that  s where the R rating is for ). Several are successful : The dolphin part at the beginning , but also frequent about the presidency of Bush and the invasion of , to counter that there is a being rather irritating . Also funny to see the image have of and vice being exaggerated to the extreme . There  s another joke where a truck of weed is stopped and by police , only because it is not the right time to unload your truck ( in a nutshell ). Despite some successful basic and a lot of unsuccessful , they could have more . Also no effort is made ( maybe deliberately ) to tell a coherent story : There is for example a of the death of Deuce  s wife , but the story is never finished . The ending is a direct copy of The Naked Gun 33 1 / 3 : The Final Insult , as it with a bomb scare on the equivalent of the Academy Ceremony for man - , although the remembrance of dead man - is funny again . One final note : the trailer is a lot worse than the movie itself .",0
"I got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and  t know what to expect . The premise silly and I assumed it would be a lot of shallow make - fun - of - the - virgin humor . What a great surprise . I so hard I cried at some of the . This film is a must see for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor . ..... this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother ( Jack ?) or small . The language is filthy , the are ( very ) crude , and the sex talk is about as graphic as you  find anywhere . What  s amazing , however , is that the movie is still a sweet love story . My and I both it . is terrific , but ( like The Office ) the supporting cast really the film work . All of the have their , but they also have depth and likability . Everyone their weight and the chemistry is perfect . I can  t wait to get the . I  m sure it will be up there with Office Space for and quotable .",1
"I  m not quite sure who would walk into this movie anything other than a slasher movie . House of Wax is exactly that -- a slasher movie . Don  t expect heaps of intelligence to be into these idiot  , and don  t expect a story that any kind of sense , or that could actually happen in real life . DO expect some of that sweet , sweet blood and gore that we all know , love , and cherish . That  s the only reason why we go to see this gruesome cheese , anyway . I will say this : it GOOD . And I mean , GOOD . Her death alone would make this worth with your blockbuster  freedom pass . Or maybe you  d rather rent something decent . Whatever . Your call .",1
"Wow , I think I am being to nice with the two . This movie , I wasted 10 to go see this , The only reason I saw it was because Rob was in it , and his are always funny , but at the end of this movie , I totally lost my respect for this movie and this actor , after this . I this movie . There was no humour and way to much nudity . I am officially scarred for like , and the that happen in that movie or so disgusting . I think this movie , and so do a lot of , so if you want to watch a movie , i suggest going to see a Duff movie because at least there is the point to those childish , this movie was pure crap . I think that if you really want to see it , you should wait to rent it but even then you wasting your money .",0
"Went into the theater thinking of   and  The Patriot , especially since the were quite squarely at patriotic . Sadly , the movie  t deliver ... not that it  s a bad film , but I was a lot more action , many more  Raj was 100 % tyrannical & evil  and a gripping conclusion . None of my were met . Yet , it  s a decent movie with too many ( the & Mosque were completely uncalled for ) and good acting . Just don  t watch it with too many like I did .",0
"This movie was a lot better then I have which a lot since I  seen many , many . When I saw the Trailer , I was a bit skeptical about the whole thing but Mark gave me a reason to see it . I   Job  and other he had been in so I had decided to check it out . The acting in this movie was impressive by each cast individual . The was deep and expanding , branching off into different for each of the character . My favorite character , Jack had the most unique of them all that left his past for pretty much any . a lot of potential and I hope to see him in more in the future . So in general , this movie had itself more then I could imagine . no movie is never perfect , and this is no different , I gave it a high rating because I in feeling disappointed but came out satisfied instead of the other way around .",0
"This sequel nothing to do with the original . The humor is dumb , the are mindless , there are ( unfunny !!!) about , oral sex , and so on . This movie is unfunny , and I don  t see its laughter . This movie is sexually offensive and I will never watch it . Please , DON  T WATCH  DEUCE : ! STOP YOUR CURIOSITY . I don  t like this movie . It is stupid , pointless , unfunny , and even worse than the original . This movie is and also . I think this movie is awful , tasteless and is a bad sequel . There are repeated to sex , and , homosexuality , bestiality , tricking , and pimping . My Rating : 1 out of 10 .",0

"Team  is a breeze of freshness in a genre that deeply dormant or plainly dead , since the back in the 80s . Also , it  s the first serious comical treatment - if I may say so - that the war on terror , whatever you believe this . Nobody clean out of the impertinent treatment of the script .

"This is the first time I had seen . Perry  s work and was very . I was happy to see the film contain a message , however , I did feel it could have gone without some of the sexual content and definitely the drug usage . I was delighted to see that . Perry was the author of some of the in the movie and will definitely purchase the sound track . The music was soulful and beautiful the way gospel music should be . I felt the presence of the Lord hearing the . Can  t wait to crank them up in the van ! I look forward to more of . Perry  s work in the future and am off to the video store right now to see what else   to offer .",1
"This movie was great . It  s the first must see movie of the year since Crash . It back to the old . The shoot out are unlike any i  seen in a movie - they show violence in its state . It one of the best car in a film that i  ever seen . It definitely you on the edge of your seat . The acting , writing and direction is tremendous . Low budget  t show - it  s beautifully shot . The violence - but Mark  s character the focus of his mother  s death and is unrelenting - i  m not sure how i  d feel in this situation - but Mark  s character is unwavering . Fantastic film - highly recommend it .",0
"I absolutely adore this film ! I mean how can you not love it ... I always thought that Titanic would always be my romantic movie but then then this came along out of the blue and everything ! The are down to earth , the setting is realistic and the actual romance is believable ! Its these that make it feel personal and real . The and  t or and the actual acting is brilliant because the chemistry between Gosling and is so amazing . I personally think that they are in a different league and will hopefully be in the future because they are brilliant .",1
"This movie was fantastic . A lot of the people who  t like it  t understand the or allow themselves to accept the good humor . It was fantastically written and like the first - will be a sleeper classic . I totally recommend seeing this movie in the theater with a large group of . Please keep an open mind when watching it because if you do not choose to then you will find the movie very unenjoyable . It a lot of humor that older  t find very funny but the teen - generation would find very funny . I was laughing nonstop . Griffin and Rob are a winning combination . If the had some sort comedy category , this movie would definitely fall in to that category !",0
"This is a great movie for both men and ! I agree with it  s  R  rating , due to foul language and sexual talk / innuendo , but none of it away from the movie itself . You will thoroughly enjoy this movie whether on a date or out with a few . This movie sweet along with laugh out loud that will make you second guess your desire to take a drink of soda ; you may end up spitting it on the person in front of you as you burst out laughing at the many hilarious this movie . During a time when the movie industry may put out only one good comedy a year , this year we  been blessed with two outrageous - The Wedding ( an absolute MUST SEE ) and The 40 Year Old Virgin . So , grab your significant other or a group of and treat yourself to an extremely laughable good time .",0
"this movie is nothing but a ride that you go on in a theme park all the but not worth the money spent on it . the movie style of story play with some acting . The main character never to get the into the movie . He is too busy with his treasure hunt he  t care about what to him or his . and his buddy is very annoying with his lame acting and grade 1 to go with it . and the very last the doctor who is retarded just never to know what she is doing ... horrible horrible movie .... the movie some good action and a mindless story to go with it . if there are people who are mindless enough to waste their money on the have to be pretty dumb and even this movie is a crime . i recommend your money to the Salvation Army instead at least it will help the people unlike the movie . Please don  t waste your money .",0
"had about the and of this movie but I think they were wrong . This was a faithful adaptation of the book  Ghost , with first rate acting and outstanding action . When the movie ended , original news reel footage was run with the actual POW while the rolled . Nobody left the theater until this had ended . I it better than  Saving Private . A true story about true , unlike so many produced war that are written to please focus . I would recommend this movie to anyone with an interest in history as it is accurately and movingly on film .",1
"I saw this film at the premier last week with my father in law who is a U . S . Navy veteran . During the warm - up , the if there were any in the audience . My f . i . l . raised his hand and was the book on which the film is based ( Ghost ). As he is visually , he gave me the book to read . And read I did ! I finished it off by the next day . As I said , it is a good movie , but it is indeed based on a great book and the terrible horror the POW  s were subjected to . I do recommend to any to go see this film and then after get the book and read the truth about how and what really . By the way , Japan never for the maltreatment to the nor to the tortured during the war .",1
"I had to wince and look away this movie was so bad . The movie was obviously written by those low class who think anguish , bad manners , bad table manners , smoking , drinking , being drunk and stupid and acting like an ass constantly is the height of good writing and  meaning . Watching these sucking on to facilitate the smoking industry  s slick and successful attempt to keep people hooked on cancer sticks is disgusting ; and falling all over themselves , and crying while living in huge and living large is pathetic . Whine whine whine . Who ? Then watching them shovel food into gaping at the table , stuffing their drunken with in their left hand in the typical low class manner in most east coast you want to never eat popcorn at a movie again with transference endemic to such bad manners . And then the scene where the selfish , self - centered hold up all of traffic with their two blocking everyone , while they just sat and ! I would have gotten out and both their drunken . Then she through a neighborhood in her drunken state , waving at the old guy who telling her to slow down because there are . Right , individual to drive drunk with around . The liberal pampered self is .... no time for , just about them . Absolutely horrible movie . If you think Jeff and Woody Alan and that cabal of neurotic masturbatory - - , sexually guilt - ridden self - centered who wear funny little to their temple a movie for you .",0
"This film is quite simply jaw - dropping . turns in a career - performance - one which I believe a lot of his were faithfully - as a , confused individual who gradually comes to realize that his of the romance of his life were completely erased and by his hand , no less . The film itself is inventive , quirky and , I believe , a revolutionary step in not only romantic , but in cinema as a whole . While many of you may be thinking that this is a chick flick and the total opposite of your own , it is rather a film that can be incredibly enjoyable to all and especially to men , according to a survey at a film ( I forget the name just now ) but the point is that you should let society  s stereotypical of romantic prevent you from this one .",0
"Please please smite this film with all your godly , please wipe it from the face of the earth forever and ever , the release . I pray that thou wilt smite Rob Schneider too if you have a couple of .

Please help them see that the basic premise is flawed , that a woman  t have to pay for sex , and would certainly not pay Rob Schneider for sex .

", first of all this film is supposedly based on true . That  t exactly the case . I read from someone who went to the same school as and the , that half of the in the movie never , or were exaggerated to a high point . of this movie just want to sound cool and say that they saw it , making themselves  in the know  and  . And by the way , I am 16 and have seen some up crap , but where was I when 13 year - old were going about their freely and screwing 18 year old , and talking sh * t to everyone . It just  t happen that way . In my opinion , this movie was made in order to be like some of the more truthful independent like Bully . They tried much too hard in order to add shock value and awkward teen . The bottom line is , stop about how great this movie is . Wherever I go ,  Oh man , Did you see that movie with the up ? It was a totally amazing film . I can like , so relate to them  * t you can . If you haven  t seen this movie , then don  t waste your time . I regret ever seeing this sack of sh * t . You want a good movie ? Go see or Bully .",0

"Peter Best work so far ! The depth in the relationship of the fellowship to fall apart as and Sam Reach their destination ; I the sense of compassion between each of the although they  t always with each other . Although the book is more Intriguing the way the screenplay was composed worked perfectly ! This excellent work of art up to its reputation with its amazing 11 academy award winning ! With more pain , suffering , and loss throughout the story , the deliver a powerful sense of their with their . In my opinion this is my favorite out of the three part trilogy !!!",0
"When I bought this movie , I was a chuckle or two and to see some pretty good fight . This movie went beyond my and to be one of the best I have seen all year . The comedy had me laughing out loud , the fight were jaw dropping and to top it all off it even had some touching emotional as well . This movie it all and it comes not from the United , but rather the far east where they seem to keep making that I thoroughly enjoy . This movie a gang known as the Axe gang nearly every corner of the city save for the that are poor . That is until an aspiring man who to join the gang literally the gang violence to this peaceful little slum town with its many colorful , which a few of the are kind of well versed in kung fu . We get to see this young man make several stupid and he sort of a , but there also to be a hint of greater . are sent to deal with those who fought the Axe gang and we get a very strange musical and a man who is so well versed in martial he is known as the  Beast . Great ensue , but as for the comedy the best part to be Sing  s ( the man who to join the Axe gang ) assassination attempt of the landlady of the poor town . So if you like cinema and are in the mood for a movie that basically a lot of and action then this is definitely the one to check out .",1
"Saw is one of those that come along and you really hard . Much like   did when I first it and the original  Massacre ,  Saw  up there as one of the best horror around . The movie up with a guy in a bathtub ( one of the screenwriter  s ) chained to a large pipe ( maybe a steam pipe ?) he quickly he is not alone as another voice out to turn on the . When the are turned on we see another guy ( ) on the other side of the room chained to a large pipe as well and in between them is a dead guy . The dead guy a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other . The plot . What  s great about this movie is it never you in on what  s going on , however , on second , you see the left and right ( which is a true sign of a great movie .) We quickly find out the police ( Glover ) is looking for a notorious serial killer  , by the curious ways he leaves his . However , what  s interesting , and as the police point out , is that he  t do the ... or does he ? Since this movie is very intricate it  s hard to explain the without giving away crucial plot / turning , but it  s that very thing that this movie great . I have seen almost every horror movie out there and I  m pretty numb to most , but this movie , let me tell ya , I had / about this movie days after I  seen it , trying to figure out what I would in the same situation . I must say , this movie is one good scare , just when you think it  s falling into a routine , Bam ! it you again . I highly recommend this movie if you truly want a great horror movie .",1
"There was definitely too much , but the movie is still worth seeing if you don  t object to obscene humor in principle . I found it amusing rather than sidesplitting funny . However there are several that make the show well worth it . My favorite  straight  telling of the joke is by , whom I don  t otherwise know and have not seen among the top here . Other than that , the where I were not so much when the  joke  was being told , much less and upon , but when the comedian would add something unexpected . Needless to say , don  t go see this if you dislike crude humor .",0
"A daughter her home to meet the to announce their engagement . Problem is her family is black , her , Green ( ), is white and she  t told them . The funny stuff was shown a million times in the . And , I can only remember two of those times , but they were pretty good . When I got to see the movie , that funny stuff  t as funny as before , and the rest of the movie was filled with tired old , bad , and an overpowering black father , ( Mac ). No one stood out except for Mac . He had all the good and everything , and no one him . Now , that is , up to a point , and he did have cause to be upset -- his daughter home a white guy without telling anyone . But , he is more upset that is something and not that is white . brought absolutely nothing to the table and he should hope That 70s Show and that other one he is involved  t . The mother ( ), and daughter ( ) had that are good enough for family , but no more than that . Oh , the acting was good , but the all throughout in that it was too bland . That is , the except for Mac  s . Some were pretty good . Yes , this to Guess Who  s Coming to Dinner , Meet the , Meet the , but those , while not all that funny , were , at least , not bland . , Guess Who  s Coming To Dinner was nervously funny because of the time it ago ... in the 1960s , I believe .",1
"The first time I saw the movie I was crazy about it . I did not want to speak to anyone nor do anything . I to rise my arms and cry --- yes , just like what did . It really me greatly . I believe it is a terrific film because it all a film should have . The plot , the , the director , the are all top . So I want to see it for another time . Then I find out that I don  t like the which for power and strength . Why can  t the letter just between two . It  s obvious the director tell us something in a obvious way . But it  s not serious , this is quite personal . I still know what I can get from this movie . The more I see it , the more I get . I know the happy ending , will he succeed in the real world ?",1
"I caught a sneak preview of this flick from the front row of a theater . Nonetheless , a good time was had . What me about this movie was twofold . 1 ) It was free . 2 ) One of my female first told me about it and read aloud many of the dirty and , often times naming body and that I found incredibly exciting . I would have a movie with such a narrow focus to drag , but it  t . I was also some sort of free - speech slant to , which would have been incredibly boring . But they  t do this either . It was just pure entertainment . My only word of caution : See this movie at an off - peak time . There will be a lot of from the audience ( and applause , God help us ), which can drown out some of the . The come in rapid succession , so a boisterous crowd will certainly tax the ear if not ruin entirely . Enjoy !",0
"It was both great entertainment and great historical lesson too . Even though I knew the outcome of the raid , I was with the story  s tension and plot . ( Much like in  s , 13  movie ) The love interest of the story was fictional , but did not take away from the power of the true story , it enhanced it . The musical score added a touch of reverence and respect to the movie , similar to the musical score in  Saving Private ,  Band of  and  We were Once . I especially the transition between B / W and color . As far as historical lesson goes - well done . I especially the actual footage at the end of the movie . Showing the and with the real people , and short synopsis of the raid  s statistics , and footage that the POW  s return trip home - from beginning to end was magnificent . My only wish was a little more information of the what of the actual featured in the film . I plan to buy the when it is .",1
"I have my position about horror before ; many times . I don  t hate all horror , I  seen a few that I love but then there are not lots of them which me or anything similar . Less during these days , where of young people go somewhere and by different . All of them except for the who  be the ; the or however you prefer to call it . These are either or original new . I haven  t seen them all , but I know ;  The Massacre ,  The Horror  and just to avoid making the list longer , one I recall watching  Wrong Turn . Some and had a problem in the road and were by  human  in the forest . I two of them . Now this other one ,  House of Wax , a remake of an old movie I  t see . So I won  t make , I  just take on the recent picture ; where some and have a problem in the road and And I  m not telling anything because you know it and you know it better , I believe , if you saw the old version . However the case , what I always say is that I don  t mind the ending in a horror film because it  s impossible to change it , but I mind the way the get to it . The last time I checked ( Wrong Turn , I have in mi head how bad it is ) the people barely knew each other and they were without a reason , or in other , I  t figure why those  human monster  them ; it was totally nonsense . This of course works for those crazy horror , who love to see blood all over and getting cut , and so on . That  s why horror always get the best of , visually speaking . All of this is included in  House of Wax , but with extra . These are the that attract a person like me , who  s not in only for the I said before . The blood , the , everything , but for a reason . So , the are , Bo and Vincent ( both convincingly by Van Holt ), and their story goes way back , and their departure from that story There  s also between the , and between the , who are not extremely close , but in a way share strong . And I wonder what would have been of these in other  skin . I say it because anyone by now what a good actress is . She is very solid in her role in this film and right now I  m praying God so that she leaves her hair the way she is wearing it in the movie . Like , Chad is known for his beauty , but he the and the personality to create defined . If you were wondering , works perfectly , at least for what she needs to do . The cast is by the versatile , the monotone but charming and the rigid  chard . Teens go to see the movie because they think these are cute , but they forget they are . Then in my the result is : non - stop entertainment . take a step into the different side , and get their credit for making the ride not as stubborn as it could have been . The  beginner  Collet - Serra  t seem a beginner at all , because he  s feature simply beautiful , and that to be a unanimous judgment . He his own detailed world and even if it would lead to my death , I would like to see it .",1
"Not the I remember , or were they trying to make us forget the original . Seriously , I have seen good movie of old , but this was NOT one of them .

Instead , we got a movie that was on the title and a couple of big name alone to sell . I felt I was of what could have been a good move . Not a great movie , just a good movie , but I never it to be as bad as this movie is . , , were all good , but the script was bad . did nothing for me .",1

Although I did not know what Bob said to , that was sure to be their new start . If you have a real friend , you will never feel lonely again . In fact it is hard for a man to keep pure friendship with a woman in reality . gave us an excellent screenplay . She deserved the academy award . Bill  s funny show me of Ghost buster . Obviously young had a good potential . I am sure that she will have a bright future . A well - done movie that can warm your heart . 8 / 10",1
"There is no argument that this was the best movie of 2003 . It got 11 academy which is what it definitely deserved . I saw this movie opening day with a couple and we were all very happy with it . It is a great conclusion to the trilogy and the and special effects are better than in fellowship and the two . The battle of is probably the most awesome battle I  ever seen in a movie before . The story was wonderful and up right where the two left off and does it great job of actually moving the story along with really good . The plot is great just like the first two . The acting is really good as well . going down hill since the ring is taking him over and he does a great job of acting in the evil kind of way . as is wonderful just like in the two . The movie is probably the most dramatic out of the three and it  s not melodrama or corny drama , it  s actually good and very well done in the conclusion of the movie . The movie for 3 and 20 . The only minor complaint I have toward this movie in the ending . It was dragged on for a little bit too long and I also thought could have a little better when and Sam finally it . It should have like how it in the first two with it  s scorching red sky and a dark dark land of with thunder and lightning that crazily good . In return of the king , more like a night time on a cloudy day . Maybe it  s a sign of loosing power . Who . These are just minor that don  t take away any of my for this movie . Most people would say this was the best out of the trilogy . I personally like them all three of them the same though . These are my favorite of all time and it  s probably not about to change .",0
"This movie no value at all . First off the acting was i don  t care what you say they completely bombed that portion . Any woman could do what she did in that film , which of drinking and going saying  no one to me . wait where was the plot .. oh yea there  t one . Oh and don  t you love how boy just randomly fell in love with her . For a movie with no plot you at least need character development . The ending completely buried the film in its own stupidity and then went on to crap on its headstone . Don  t waste your life , this was an embarrassment to the independent film world .",1
"Same H , New Lo . Thats its and that it all . The very low standard is what you like or what you don  t like . People that are negative about this film should not go see another film , because you know what too expect . This film some stupid stuff in it like Rob Schneider saying that the Dutch the slave trade which is untrue , but it  s just one of those about The that are assumed and about as if true , and particularly about some exist as well . In : , comes across as the world capital of and thats an image a lot of have , but it  s grossly exaggerated , just like anything else in this movie . Some were fine , some were poor , but Rob just what you can expect when you  seen the first . So go see it if you like this kind of humour , and forget the negative .",0
"i thought this film was amazing . i really it , i felt character was one a lot of people could if not emphasize with - then at least understand . There were some really touching , moving to the film which were with a lot of wry humour - which i . i think the but most poignant bit in the film was when is at his house party in the beginning and their spin the bottle on the floor but he  s on the sofa and all this buzz and is happening around him but he  s just sitting there with what like in his - i thought that bit was just beautiful ! anyway conclusively - i give top to this film , absolutely brill !",1
"After being few times , the timing of the release of this film  t have been more perfect , just two days before the I - Day . Any Khan film is always to and it becomes more vivid if he is on celluloid after a gap of four . Add to this , another name who is  s most critically director . And to top all this , a historical subject of Mangal - the first crusader of the first war of Independence . history innumerable , whose are easily forgotten or never . Such people  s needs more than just a mention in school  s history . Amongst many such is the name of Mangal . This is a film where fiction real story set in 1857 AD when  Company Raj  the fate of people in subcontinent . In such times , a brave Sepoy Mangal in army to go against those who the land first and then slowly everything up to the of . This is when the first mutiny and a new page is added in the history of both & . Khan Mangal passionately with a complete conviction . His , his , his overall persona go further to complement his onus as the most brilliant actor we  around . Toby as who the most difficult path where he himself constantly in amid like duty , friendship , loyalty and love , but he comfort in the company of Mangal who is a friend for life . Mangal and  s love are pleasantly by Rani ( ) and Patel ( ), in - spite of being there only for  - audience / - success  method . But such cinematic are excusable if it to boost the film in anyway . The film  s attention to detail is immense and visually very strong . A . R .  s music  t seem to be his best or probably the oddity of  situation to create that musical impact , but  Mangal Mangal  song is a spot - on to the theme and the central character . All the between and Toby are a delight to watch . Toby  t fail to impress with his acting or his - speaking .  s performance with every frame until he the peak in the final courtroom scene where he all the of just being the actor around , but him clearly in a class of his own . After ( very strong film ) & Mangal , the should think of a more substantial subject to hold the global audience instead of only trying to on before independence . This is not to take away anything from the independence movement , but we  come a long way from that phase and its time to show that , without to cater only to very   ( song & dance , colorful & heavily designed clothing , overflowing , huge ) style loving audience . These can make or mar a film depending on how naturally they get absorbed in a film script . While watching this film I myself from any or surrounding it , but still this ballad short of rhythmic in totality . This rising only up to a likable and only - for - film mark , when it could and should  been much more .",1
"I must preface my by first saying that on a purely visceral level , I did like Alien Predator . her own very well . So well in fact that I would like to see her again . It was a real thrill seeing the and the get it on . It was also cool to see totally out of their league on a battle field of dueling . True . For any of them to survive was a real triumph , yet I totally bought the rationale behind  s survival . Now for the : What went wrong ? The have been going through this Right - of - passage training ritual for of . They built many labyrinthian , presumably getting better at it as time went on . So again , what went wrong ? They are obviously aware of the current stage of human technological development because they us their with heat to attract our . Did they think we went there to ritually sacrifice our . If so , why did they kill everyone in the whaling station ? Why was it so surprising that the team found their way to the ? There were no . If we can build a satellite we just might be able to read and figure out their sarcophagus calender lock which was based on our own planet  s . The boomerang and their were made of metal impervious to the alien  s acid blood ( unlike their wrist that instantly melt on contact ). Why  t the mother alien with that stuff ? And if the belt is designed to take her to the sacrificial chamber , how did all of those other get into the incubation room . How was the pyramid designed to stop this ? The poor design of the pyramid is inconsistent with the technological sophistication that built their ultra quiet ship with ultra refined . One last thing . The mother the predator through it  s back and out of its chest with her tail and it . The tag scene the predator / alien larvae burst out of the dead predator  s chest . Why break out when the mother conveniently a ready made birth canal ? And more curiously , why was the alien larvae not when the host through the chest ? And even more curiously , why did she kill the last predator . Alien 3 established that they do not kill . Or was it because in Alien 3 the larvae was a mother alien ? Which that they will kill their young , but that is contrary to their previous behavior , except in Alien Resurrection ( which I , so I will not go any further with that ). Or should I just ignore this fact because very few people like Alien 3 . Personally , I a lot about that one also .",1
"The do a good job gushing about the movie . Sure we  re and bound to like the movie more than the usual fare , but those looking for an original and thrilling movie experience , this will shock and amaze . The Firefly world a fantasy home for many of us , with we truly about and we could get behind . The best way to describe it is to take the best of the Han Solo of the original Star , and build a world around that . There  s no grand theme or clear cut good and evil . There  s just a band of trying to make their way in a dangerous sky . It  s something can relate to , although most of us won  t be in a space battle or fighting psychotic soon . The point of the name Serenity is the name of the ship , though in a sense that  s what our are in search of . Finding freedom and a home , and that  s what the ship to them , and to the . So you understand why so many are so excited about this dinky little flick . The movie that beautiful feeling but us on a ride that there  s no turning back from . In my opinion , the one thing that for a truly GREAT movie is if you walk out of the theater a different person than when you in . This movie you on such a journey I  t know if I would leave the theater at all . Sure the visual effects are stunning , but even the unfinished effects I saw meant nothing to me because it was the I about ( and note that the digitally ship itself is one of them , and I just as much for that than any of them ). The humor is probably better than anything in the this year , and the action is even greater . My screening actually came a week after Episode 3 was , and I immediately washed my of , and later when I saw Fantastic 4 ... well let  s not even talk about that one . This movie really does have something for everyone , and even in the core of the geek fandom , the range of people is total - men and split it at least 50 / 50 , - and  cool  , and a surprising amount of attractive people of all . Seriously though , don  t trust the of the . Check out the movie for yourself . Give it an honest chance and I promise you will be taken on a journey that will turn you into a fan as well .",0
"I  m not really sure what i think of this movie ... I  m usually a fan of most of , but this one is a bit iffy . the story is basic , simple bare vengeance at first , then to get more complicated , when maybe it should have just stayed simple . also , I  m not really a fan of mark   voice , especially when supposed to be a tuff guy , or a bad ass ... he just like a phony , or even a pussy . but i admit , he did have most of the best . this movie was so close to being really good , but something was missing ... i just cant really say what . sure , there were lots of dumb just for the sake of looking cool , but ya tend to forgive that sometimes in this type of movie . while to over act a bit , the rest of the cast as if they could care less . i was a bit disappointed in , since i actually him in be cool , but here , he just  t put to good use . any way , this  t horrible , bad , or a crap movie , but its not great or all that good either , I  m a bit on the fence ... sorry",0

When we  gone over the whole movie again , he  what other funny are there  and we go silent in concentration . The that make this movie so great are the , and the pure unrealistic stupidity that is a necessity when building a comedy like team . The have made all the special and they have made them all funny . If you really listen to the , there  s more to laugh at . PEARL HARBOUR was meant to be a sort of love song but when you listen to the , it fun of other and . Its a great movie that 10 / 10 .

"All right , how many of us would actually expect a movie like this to be good or above average ? I mean , many urban or street revenge are usually just average , so - so . But this , I must say , is a good one . The story was catching enough as it is . It might be typical or mindless at times , but it its funny , its tense , and where you will be at the edge of your seat . There is really not much bad to say about this movie except that maybe the end could have been better and certain could have been differently . But there are four ( perhaps more ) why this movie is good -- four main at that . The first one is already -- about the story being catching and so on . The second reason is because in this movie you get a feel of how close these really are , regardless of their of race . You see them together as a family and act like everyday when they  re not out beating people up . And with that said , the third reason is how convincing the are , especially . I have seen him in plenty of , but now I think I will see him as the bad boy , hot - headed Bobby from this . He did a very well job as did the rest of the cast . The final reason why this movie is good is because it stays to what it is . It does not stray , suddenly become an intense drama or overly done comedy , . I think you know where I  m going here . This movie stays as what it is supposed to be -- an urban revenge flick . Other like this take whole different route and stray from the story . I was afraid this would do the same , especially when it explaining why everything . But I am happy to say that I am not disappointed . If you are into these of , I  m sure you will feel the same . It was not bad at all =) 7 / 10",1

"No matter what , I have always Singleton , and i  t pass this one up . The story and plot weak at first , but don  t be ! The story becomes unpredictable !

I was skeptical at first , there  t been a  good  Singleton movie in a while , and i thought there will never be , but again , i got proved wrong . Obviously , this movie  t for , there is one gory scene ( but I don  t want to spoil it for you ) and in the end , it was totally worth watching . There are that are funny and there are that make you want to cry . It really up nicely .

"I  m fully willing to admit that this is a really remarkable script . I  m also fully willing to admit that every actor in this film did an absolutely amazing job . I  always been a Clive fan , but this is just above and beyond . Portman too . And . And Law . Ah , heck , everybody was great . However ,  t anybody think the ending was ... well , bad ? I was locked into the film for the entirety , right up until the slap . Then , for no reason , they put in a hokey slow - motion sequence . After that , I have no real , except that the significance of  s ( or rather , Jane  s ) fraudulent identity is not to the extent it should be . The stage play an entire scene with Larry , Anna , and Dan in Postman  s Park where they discover  s memorial and talk about why she might have made herself up . It much better closure to the viewer and there  s no slow - motion . About the slow - motion : the slap is about the , not about the action itself . This is once again something that worked better in the stage play . No possibility of slow - mo to a play . It a focus on the interaction between Dan and and not on themselves . It  s not the slap , it  s the fact that he her . I know , I know : you can  t compare the stage to the screen , they  re two different media . I know this already . All I  m saying is , they could have it in a manner that at least some semblance of the retrospective atmosphere in the stage play . And the slow - mo slap ? Talk about a complete mood - ruiner !

"This is a really well written , directed and war movie . I wish it had been in real , natural color , not the grey overtone to make it look like it was during . Everything about it is great except the photography . The tried to create the same effect in  Sky , World of Tomorrow  with Law . This out effect is unnatural and from the overall quality of the film . There is nothing wrong with real color , rather than it to look like a lesser quality film was used . There is some archive footage that was undoubtedly during the war and is black & white . That  s fine , but modern film  t need to be made to look like it  s lower quality film . The war are very realistic . The film is a great depiction of the underground activity in Manila , as well as realistic from the POW camp . The rescue operation is suspenseful and detailed .

"This movie was so amazing . I really it , the only character I being Drew  s . Thrilling at and hilarious at , it  s one of those rare black comedy / romance / psychological that I was hooked on from beginning to end . Watch this as long as you won  t be offended by quite strong language or permanently scarred by a man in a bunny suit . I  seen it too many times to count , and each time I  m by the new depth I discover . of story and keep on , making this one of those you won  t get of after seeing it again and again . Everything comes together in the end , or it will if you  everything closely up till that point . This film everything from child pornography to the . Jake a fantastic performance as , a guy with serious , a man dressed in a pink bunny suit and insect mask Frank whom only he can see . is her real - life role as his sister . is awesome in her role as  s love interest , a tough job for anyone . Drew is all right , but I got the feeling that she was only there to give the film real star - power ; her character was needlessly put in in some . However , one him - or herself involved in the  , from  s mind to his mother  s lack of commitment to Sparkle Motion . It  s not a movie for the faint of heart or tolerance to language and . Even when this movie is making fun of , like , it is giving its and . This is NOT a movie in which you can drift off , not pay attention , or think of as a light - hearted farce . Don  t be by anything you may have about this being for ; sure , it  s funny at , but that  t what it  s about .   is a new turn on emotional distress in , time travel , and psychiatry . I don  t even pretend to fully comprehend the true meaning of this movie . Maybe I  m taking it too seriously , but I find it more likely that I just don  t understand what was and is happening in the of the people who made this movie or in the of people who actually know what this . I  been blown away by other , but this one made me think more than anything . Try not to be too skeptical about the in this movie , and don  t be by the surprising . I can  t think of another movie that me as much as this one . See it , because even if it  t affect you as it did me , it will provide a couple of enjoyment .",1

Unlike those Jet Li my little , Unleashed context and resonance to its action by wrapping them around a pitiful , tragic and endearing central character who  s all too likable and making the action grow out of the story rather than the other way around . When the Jet Li character is back into his animalistic world after the of family & love , we genuinely fear for him and hate the villain , a nasty , ferocious Bob who through out to be fun in the role . A typical action movie would  done away or the second act in the film in which is taken in by Morgan Freeman and his stepdaughter , but Unleashed is all the more special in making you interested and care about who don  t so much as pick a gun .

"The picture that painted of was more a caricature than a character study . Knowing very little about before seeing the movie , I can  t say if the depiction was accurate or not . was as a lost soul and an personality , searching for salvation and finding it in his passion for grizzly . However , according to the film , passion quickly turned to obsession and went beyond conservation to his own life , the life of his and the well being of the he to love so much in grave danger . He was accused of the wildlife to such an extent that he lost touch with reality Out of the 100 of footage to which had access , he chose to use film that as a at best and at worst someone who was narcissistic , egocentric , paranoid and deranged , bent on his own destruction . Is this the best could do ? The film very and exploitative of , his story and Grizzly People , the foundation for conservation that he left behind . The and staged . The cinematography was spectacularly poor . was in what is probably one of the most wildly , naturally beautiful of North and he did nothing to showcase it .

"As a Hitchhiker fan , I was afraid of this movie . I thought they could spoil the story and make an unintended mockery of  s cult book for those who haven  t read it .

For those who know the story , there is something new as well , like the romance between and , a new character and an extra stop to a planet . The appearance and behavior of the were not quite what I made up in my head ( especially  s ), but who could have them better . The story is a bit more happy and optimistic than in the book .

With all of the recent 60 year marking the end of World War , it was hard to avoid the on the History channel , the military channel , .... the Bataan Death March is something I only recently about - I don  t think I even learned about it when I was in school . I really did not know what to expect when I into the theater - I was blown away . Thank you to all who worked and made this film , it is such an important piece of history , you all should be so ! I have myself to read more about - especially the war in the Pacific and what during the Great Raid .",1
"This movie is a love story , except if you go in to see it , it  s anything but ordinary . First first , you must let your imagination roam a little bit . The whole process of being able to actually be inside your own mind as you slowly watch the love of your life being erased in front of your very can be a bit much if you don  t use your imagination . Best thing to do , put yourself , whether your male or female , in  s ( ) . Now , the of the story are very relatable . Man and woman meet , attract , and they fall in love . However , as with all in life , they come to part ways . rather quickly , after running into his former ( ), that she had him permanently erased from her memory . Confused , out the doctor who the procedure , and in a fit of anger , possibly even revenge , he to have the procedure done himself . However , as the procedure place , as he from the last memory of ( a wonderful scene mixed with harsh and dialogue ) backwards to the of when the relationship was at it  s peak , he to realize that in his heart he still her . , and to think of every way possible to change the track of his so that will still be there in his mind whenever he wakes up . Fate , nonetheless , does not conspire with him , and he finally comes to the last ( or in this case , the first ) memory ; the one where he and first met . The following scene is absolutely wonderful . This is where it all comes together ... everything that in the story , with the addition of the strong feeling  s for ( and in  s case , the she may still have for ), it all climax  s in this beautiful scene , with : : This is it , ... it  s going to be gone soon . : I know ... : What should we do ? : ( ) Enjoy it . This scene comes down and gave me such a great case of emotion , because , even after trying to hide from erased this simple lesson : Life is fleeting . Life , and the people you meet and love , is a gift . And even though he he is about to lose her forever , instead of trying to run and hide , he those back , and himself to  enjoy it , a truly mature and engaging line that will bring down your spine . And the final scene in the house , the climax to it  s end in a truly remarkable way . As they say their final inside an old house on the beach , as  s character let  s out every single emotion and thought inside of his heart out . Not only is the dialogue amazing , but the image of that memory being erased and the fact that he is losing her is by the fact that as the scene slowly , the house to fall apart . You begin to feel such an apathy for these , and maybe it  s because we  all been there before . Everyone of us . This story is so relatable it you to become in the story  s and . The writing and simply phenomenal , my hat  s go off to . The only reason I give this movie a nine of ten is the ending . I won  t give away too many , because the ending the story . I would  the ending slightly and not have gone into the ending like the story . However , my aside , if you haven  t seen this movie , you must . It may be at first , but you  get it . Watch it again if you need to . But if after watching this movie , if you don  t re - examine certain of your life , if this movie  t make you love your significant other ever more or make you pine for the lost love of your life , then unfortunately you  t get the point . Watch it one more time . For those of you who do feel as if you have watched an eye - opener , take life by the and  enjoy it .",0
"I am rating it a nine because it is really good for a Rob Schneider movie . I throughout the whole movie . Deuce to after a dolphin incident in the . himself in a string of male gigolo so Deuce up male again to clear  s name . There is a lot of sexual humor and the movie the R rating and it maybe should have been rated - 17 . This movie  t as good as the first but it really  t as bad as all the say . I it because the movie made me laugh out loud . Everyone in the theater was laughing . Some of the humor is over the top and the constant of different sexual is annoying since most people have no idea what they are and the can only guess at their . Norm is great in it with his bit part and of course a small cameo . I am a Rob Schneider fan and he is perfect in this movie .",0

It essentially 100 ( and 1 mime ) telling ( and / or on ) the same joke . It that this joke , and I won  t tell it here , greatly depending on who is telling it , and the more foul and profane it becomes , the it is . As such , if you are remotely prudish , shy , wary of foul language , or if you prefer entertainment that is politically or socially correct , stay away from this film .

"The High and the Mighty  been hidden away in the family for many . The recent release that and this near classic fully and uncut . I say near classic because although the film is an exciting and well drama , it is nonetheless a little and predictable . The story the flight of a plane load of from to San . Along the way one of the fail and it becomes questionable as to whether the plane will make to San or have to be in the open sea .

"I  t agree more with all the people who this film . What a complete waste of time spent with 4 self - absorbed dull who have absolutely no basis in reality . Their and are completely arbitrary , and the talk about sex is there only to make the script appear  racy  because it does nothing for the plot or for character development . For all those people who think this is sparkling dialogue and a mature look at love and sex , then you need to advance beyond the maturity level of a 16 year old . These people fall in and out of love like - on sugar . There  s no chemistry between any of them , and the writer to think that the world works on the basis that  if I like her , therefore she me . this to  Who  s Afraid of ? is like my golf swing to Tiger  s ...",0
"Other here have given good evidence as to why this film is a failure , so I need not go on about it here . I would like to add however , that  Closer  does show , without any sort of brilliance or depth , just what a bland bore Tony Blair  s  Cool  become . Where boring people are content with being snotty and obnoxious and self - centered , and there  s really no outstanding reason NOT to be . The emptiness is everywhere . And what are two doing in all of this ? The story might as well be in , . is as nothing . And Mike ! Once a master director , now , his , to make a hip picture with , should have known better . This rubbish , from the man who brought you  Who  s Afraid of  and  The Graduate ! Think about retirement , Mike . Every opportunity for making this story into something noteworthy was spitefully thrown away . At least the petulantly  victorious  so - dermatologist Clive could have in a scabies or eczema joke or something when he just reduced delicate Law to . And this , in the Land of Python ! It almost one pine for the days , when at least the Great spirit of satire was alive and well . Now we have a sort of transatlantic blandness . Yak yak yak , blah blah blah . So I have to assume that the cast and crew thought they were making some sort of intellectual statement , either via a modern existentialism , or via a much technique : by the audience softly with just plain boring and uninteresting empty . If they to dabble in this sort of water , they could have at least done a of Peter  s masterpiece ,  The Cook , The Thief , His Wife and Her Lover . But boring is and does not require so much depth or imagination .",0
"Gosh . Where to begin ? Everything in this movie was bad : the script , the , the acting , the , and even the make - up . This movie was not scary ... at all . Despite what I was , it  t even gory . It had some gore but it was pretty tame . The only thing positive I can say about it is a character . Satan pretty cool . He was very original could have been in a different movie . However this does not make up for the previous hour and a half of stupid , cheap , and the most puzzlingly bad last half hour of a film that I  seen in a while . This movie its mark completely .

I think Brad is a great director , and his decision to put that at the end of the movie and not near the beginning with the first book was a great idea . And saving Sunny . I hear people slaying that Violet was supposed to save her , and i always respond to them :  How could Violet save Sunny if she was acting at the time . If she had left Sunny would ave .

"This is the best picture I  ever seen . Until this terrific , my favorite was 1951  s  Operation Pacific . The restoration of the feature is very nice . That the vibrant   and the crisp . The second disc of the set many , one of which the arduous task of a tired old print and hissing so that we can see and hear it as did the audience in 1954 . I also really the on and absolutely endorse the notion that the score is as important to this picture as any other element . It is interesting to me , a vintage plane buff , that the ship they used was a then - obsolete - 4 . The head stewardess ( not being chauvinistic -- they were   back then ) that they  d be flying around 6 - 7 thousand . That  s accurate , as the - 4 had no . Since the - 6 ( which was and could fly higher ) was in  48 , it was very commonplace by  54 . My theory is that the and Aircraft 20th Century Fox to use an old plane , lest the flying public worry that the current - 6s were subject to such failure . I  d be interested if someone can confirm this .",1
"Before I begin , I would like to point out that I have read and love the book , but it  t important to me that the movie the plot exactly , as I know that would be pretty hard to do . I have no experience with the / radio series what so ever .( MAY CONTAIN ) I went to the theater to see this movie with my dad and two of my . I had somewhat mixed towards it because from what I had seen in the and so on  t exactly give me the impression that they had on what I appreciate in the . Already from the start , me and the movie  t get along well , since i  t very happy with neither the introduction nor the dolphin song .  So long and thanks for all the fish  is one of my all time favorite , and I think it was very poorly , partly by too much on it by it right in the beginning , and it in a way that might as well have said something like  what they really said was , and this is the punch line , you might as well start laughing right now , check out how funny this is : so long and thanks for all the fish . Needless to say , I  t like the song either , it just even more on the quote , almost wearing it out before it is even . I felt this way about most of the good . I felt the casting was decent .  With a better script , I think they could have done a very well job . In fact Alan as was the perfect casting in my opinion , as it was pretty much exactly what I his voice like when I read the . The plot a bit from the book , but I  t mind that much . I did , however mind that every scene to feel a bit pointless up until the meeting with ( which I DID like ). I think the movie should be longer , as it felt very rushed . The few times I a scene , the movie on to something completely different , making me forget about the scene almost before it was over . For a movie that is supposed to be funny , I don  t think that making me smile 2 or 3 times in total is a very good result . It was even more than the book , and way less interesting . The only response that came from the audience was a solitary chuckle a few times . I these with the whom I watched it with ( 2 out of 3 read the book ) and they agreed with everything I said . I am usually not very critical about , and there are very few that I thing are downright poor , but this , I  m sorry to say , is one of them . I realize there are many of you out there who it and I respect that , but it just  t win me over in any way .",1
"I  m really and honestly a bit in awe of this movie  s high rating on the , especially in comparison to some other , and in my opinion , better horror . Sorry to say it , but I think this movie , all the more so because I went with somewhat high and because a very good thriller could have been made from this quite inventive and interesting scenario . Before everyone posting a bunch of worthless and saying I  t get it or I don  t know horror , let me just lay out some of my : Within the first five I was at the acting and the . actually a little better against the more veteran , who was so over - emotive and so miscast I felt a bit sorry just to watch him , unfortunate since I  him in other . The dialogue really any kind of subtlety , and while I understand the necessity to introduce the killer through and of reading the newspaper , the way it was done so it was like watching a puppetmaster . It  s a case of show . tell , I think . The dialogue to be grudgingly forcing the plot along inch by inch rather than it develop . Then we have the the other : Was no one else by the sudden and jarring use of ultra fast - motion and pointlessly loud music ? I think these would  been better out much more slowly , wherein every second that becomes just that , one second closer to a death , one more ratchet of tension in which the audience could have felt the torment I  m sure the were . Something me those would have felt every second pass in those . Glover  s character to be a very unprofessional cop . Anyone involved in any aspect of investigation would know .  s pen at the scene , while odd , is purely circumstantial , and not reason to start an obsessive and far from legal stalking of the guy . In this kind of case a cop would have much more on forensic data and psychological . Yeah , I guess his mind snapped a little upon seeing his partner so brutally , but ... I just  t believe this character . Likewise to the wife and daughter , who were so , and whose only at development were by .  s disdain or at least disregard for his family that I just  t care what to them in the end , nor did I believe .  s sudden impulse to lop off his own leg in an attempt to save them . Aside from these , there were just too many and along the way . How could have up submerged in water without ? How would a medical doctor not recognize that the dead body on the floor was not dead ? What did have against ( name ?), who was the only character who was interested in or kind to him ? Could . really not think of a better way to get that phone ? Would that cell phone really work in that buried basement , and would it work only on the plot - that it did ? Why were and the only to have a long , drawn - out , two person situation ? On the plus side , I do think the initial idea is quite inventive , and , although in retrospect the ending  t seem to add up logically , the finale of Saw does stick in my mind as being the one part I thought was really fairly well done . The image of standing up , his last look at , the but not shown final of our two main -- this whole sequence was quite tense and a really unexpected bit of icing on the cake after my for the movie had so low throughout the rest of the . It just to me that a much better movie could have been made , the situation ample opportunity for a strongly character driven movie , while the outside could provide for of unbearable tension , by a more seasoned and talented director of suspense with better at his disposal and the ability to elicit better from less miscast . Tell me , am I really wrong in thinking it strange that this is the most about horror movie to come out in ... or horror just really gone so far down hill ? And tell me also , what is it exactly that everyone saw in this movie that I  t that it so far apart from all the other horror and of recent ? I really am quite curious . Toy - like people made me boy - like .",1
"Well ... It  s true enough to say the movie had a lot to live up to , the game had given me a hunger for story driven non - stop action that  t come at the cost or should i say sacrifice of making a movie look like it had simply been for an audience . the film left to be and a strange sinking suspicion that what I had watched would have been impossible even had the 2 species and had in open confrontation . that a side I was simply glad to see the franchise live on , and no one can deny the excitement and tension of simply thinking about these locked in mortal combat . The fight were impressive enough to excuse a possibly  wooden  plot - but at the end of the day I nothing more than edge of my seat action . To be fair the acting was impressive seeing as they had a tough story to bring alive - but on the back all round from my camp ! I want more and I want more predator - I want more !",1
"in the Temple of Doom was better at a rising then Mangal in this particular movie . in a stupendous and historical let down , this movie could prove to be a BIG flop . Although it was already stated that the movie was not a complete historical movie , there was a blatant lack in respect of the usual of movie making . Spot the extra who is wearing what like a digital watch !!! A compilation of in a mash of and strung together with a weak plot . The acting was by one of the main Toby who Captain stood out amongst what otherwise can only be as a B class . Toby will go far in the movie industry , but he would be better off sticking to . All in all I hope the next movie that Toby in him a a better supporting role to let a potentially excellent actor shine .",0
"excuse me did i something ? What was the point of the film ? to glamorize teenage delinquency ? to idolize disjointed ? a demand for a surrogate father ? the music was fine , the hand - camera to create some tension in some , the acting except ( eve  s ) was adequate and not much else . Maybe the film may look very cool or hip to below 25 so if you are at that age group see it , if you like something more than an ride that over an hour with beautiful people skip it , watch F ***** G is and dramatic that really you because of the fine acting and because it the picture ( the hypocritical society ).",0
"Anyone who the trajectory of from the time of  Even Small  will understand the immediate appeal that the story must have had for this intensely brilliant German director . must have to like a Beach version of his and his and even of himself in his more . This film at first to be a fair minded documentary about , the  protector  of all natural and wild in the remote of . What us , however , is that what really protection from was reality itself and that his escape into the was just a deadly game of denial . The film is also a meditation on the brute force of nature , on art and on human . My wife found the  character  of so ludicrous and offensive that she had to leave the theater . For my part , I was in awe of both  s incredible physical courage coupled with his absolute lack of judgment and his insane narcissism .

The word is that , in the person of , was a financial supporter of  s  mission  in and that a version of the story is due out sometime soon with Di the lead .

Even at his most intense of had nothing to  say  to anyone about either or himself . It was all self - serving and self - congratulatory and it is only in his grotesque death at the of a rogue grizzly that any meaningful message finally comes across .

Its hard not to feel sorry for and the young woman who with him , but the  native  scientist in the film put it quite nicely  My people have been living nicely with for of and we know enough to stay out of each other  s way . desperately to cross the boundary into the  way  of the bear because the  way of the human  was too much for him . Despite his goofy , childish demeanor he revealed himself to be a man of deep anger and resentment .

There were with the script - no continuity , no character development ; direction - which to be quite inadequate in ability to get the point across , control of a scene ; and were the main culprit .

"of a plane load of en route from to San , but this film all of the of great high drama , pun intended . It may seem to us jet that a film based on the mechanical of a prop plane that 200 at 9 , 000 above sea level is anything but a comedy a la  Airplane , but this classic with at the production helm and Wellman ( ) in the director  s chair is 22 gold .

"Yes indeed , I am one of the many who believe to be right up there with the worst in cinema , but I decided to give this one a shot . Come on , how can anyone pass up the comedic genius of Mac ? Unfortunately for us all , even the talent of . Mac could not offset the 1 - dimensional and a script that seemingly been put to film of times . Daughter home / . Father . The whole of the movie is the groveling at the father  s to try and pry some form of respect . What could the ending possibly be ??? Not only is it not funny . . . it  s flat out aggravating !

"Oh where to begin . How about direction ? But what direction ? I certainly  t see any in this movie . It me how like these even get the green light . The was just plain awful . There  s countless where I just to laugh at how poorly written most of the dialogue was . And who the heck was the casting director . The punk rocker brother is an abysmal actor . Family ? I don  t advise this but if you ever watch this movie again just watch him . It  s plain terrible . 3000 did an O . K . job considering he no formal acting background . I  d still rather see him making good music which he does very well . Mark  t shine too brightly either . I advise anyone that good taste in movie  s to just stay away . Why is this more than a 3 on this ? A 7 . 2 !! I had to bump this movie down a bit that  s just too high for this movie .",0
"Before I begin my dissection of this epic , let me just remind you the image in the west is 3 hour plus long with more & dance then actual narrative or action and little , if this is your image of I strongly advise you to watch this film . A Historical epic based on true evens and real people , this really does break the mould of your typical movie . The story on in 1857 , during Rule of . Many believe the Independence movement here , almost 90 before actually received its independence from rule . We begin the story be being to the central character , Mangal ( brilliantly by Khan , a native sepoy ( army soldier ) working for the East Company on behalf of the Raj . He a strong friendship with his commanding officer , ( by Toby ), by saving him an a war with . The story from here us to the way of life the Sepoy , totally loyal to the regime , loosing their tradition and culture . When the Sepoy  s are to use a new gun cartridge with the fat of & ( against the of both  s & ) they all face conflict within , do they go against their faith & heritage or carry on to follow the   ? When promise his friend Mangal that the will not damage his faith and are not with animal fat , Mangal him and his friend but also warning if the are false and the is true he will burn the entire company down to the ground ! You have to when your watching this spectacle these really , and was under the rule of the who used over 300 , 000 native in their armed to control the sub continent under an iron fist , and they to always have their best at heart . When the truth about these controversial gun , and a mutiny within the of the , the news spread fast . The movie some romance too with falling in love with a local prostitute hired to pleasure the , and his friend even for an girl . The movie is well shot and good narrative , it may not be to everyone  s cup of tea as this is not your standard or even type film , and the music is definitely a plus point to me especially the title song  Mangal , a , Mangal , a , Mangal . Again this won  t be to everyone  s taste especially when the viewer is trying to with the plight of the people only to see the burst into song and vibrant thrown everywhere , but this is cinema so you have to get used to I , and I this aspect . Overall I don  t think its the cross Atlantic film that the gap between & it to be , trying to please & western is difficult especially in a historical context , but it does a good job of being a serious entertainer and definitely gave me and made me of my heritage . are an acquired taste , and though this  t technically a movie with 70 % of the dialogue in , and less resonance to the viewer with no it still is a good entertaining film worth watching as an alternative",0
"First , about the acting . Well , I think is too funny . When I was reading the book , I count in the film must be cruel and very bad - tempered . * But *, * but *, * but *, is too funny , not cruel like I always imagine Count . The book is not really comic ( I know , sometimes , there are some that can help the distress ). I was not a comedy . But , after all , the acting is , particularly ( don  t laugh ) Sunny . and Browning is just . Their acting nothing to comment about . And I think their acting is really bad at the scene where the about the death of their and went back to their house which is completely . Secondly , and this is what I dislike the most about the film , is the adaptation . This is not what I was . What ? It was of so many important detail that make the film become so boring and I felt nearly asleep in the middle of the film . I know , they have to cut some part of the film  the film is going to be too long . But they don  t even know how to cut , they cut some most important . For example , why they  t keep the part when the find out how Count Uncle , disguise and hide the tattoo ? I feel really unpleasant while watching the film . So , I highly don  t recommend you this film if you have read the book . Don  t think that the book is good that the film will be perfect . And by the way , sorry for my , I  m not professional",1
"like a lot of other people who saw this movie , i was really by how good it was . it was an all around solid movie . i thought it was going to be a rather story - less action flick , so i was quite pleasantly , walking out of the . i  d recommend to pretty much everyone , except people who don  t enjoy seeing people being shot ; there is rather a lot of that : P . did anyone else find that when jack stuck his head out of the shower when they were all ( except jerry ) chilling in the bathroom , that he was really really hot ? cause i thought he was . extremely so . anyway it  s a solid movie , go see it . hope there were no major in there .",0
"Kudos to Khan for the dedication he put into the production of The Rising , an unfairly over - film , that out to deliver the story of Mangal . The fact that took 4 to make this film complete with growing his and that awesome along with of research is an anomaly in the film industry . are out 3 / day at the last estimate , but being the professional he is , to make this movie after the unprecedented success of his nominated . Without a doubt the film on his . There were many about the fact that may have been a bit in the height department for the role of a freedom fighter , but when you see his towering performance on screen , his small frame is all but forgotten . The man is answer to from . A great actor for his generation who is going to continue to bring cinema ( not ) to the international audience .... i think it  s his calling . to have out of this task of elevating cinema to an art rather than a mockery that it usually is . Without a doubt another actor who comes close to stealing the film away from is actor Toby ... i was under the impression that his role would be quite small . Instead he a fully three dimensional character who is in the entire movie . And on top of that , he the entire movie in . A best supporting actor nod is in order . This film could theoretically get an nod ( unfortunately a win maybe a hard sell ). The are probably for a Western audience , but they  have to live with them . The film does fall short of being an all time classic . But i think we may have to wait for the initial to settle down , because the movie is without a doubt the best one of 2005 . The film is slow to start , with the first half being an introduction of all the . But - interval , the story and Khan rev into the 6th gear , getting ready for the inevitable Rising post interval . Get this . I think the movie could have been a bit longer . A little more development was with some of the glossed over of rule . But , all in all , a magnificent effort from all involved , especially Khan and Toby . 8 / 10",1
"There are some strange about this film that nobody to have . But before into them probably this should be said : to a certain extent it is a throwback to way used to be made , separating itself from the host of done the last few . First of all it is a rah rah picture , not so different from the host of world war two propaganda . It to me a more realistic picture , although also nodding towards the rah rah a little was something like Objective .  s captain under the direction of Walsh was the more enjoyable performance . Somebody the music as being fine . Not to me . Actually for now music in been so over - and pounding it is bothersome , this film could have been done with a lot less of that . And as for realism , well to have not one soldier use the F word , to anybody in the service , is . Not that I it . Glad I  t have to listen to a lot of , but I had the feeling that was doing it out of some strange respect to the actual very brave men who made the raid . Even so , the Raid was fairly well done , but for me the most gripping were with the nurse . And Manila had a very nice feel to it . All in all no more than a five for this , but I am glad it was made as a reminder of just how price was by the men of world war two . And to the junk that is made , its a classic .",1
"This is one of the worst I have ever seen . Do yourself a favor ; unless your a or a thirteen year old drug addict do not watch this movie . It is a stereotypical teenage drug move . Teen does . Teen hooked . Teen to decline in social and school work . Teen away and crazy . Teen a lesson in life . Character development is horrible and the music is nerve racking .

The plot is pathetic and borderline nonexistent . There was a random part where it switched into hyper - video - game mode and I felt like I was watching a sequence from the game .

"It is an amazing true story , that deserved better than this . There were two major that from the movie : 1 . Freshly , new - looking US ( the actual documentary footage from the raid & the US haggard from their trip through the jungle . Yet in the movie , they look like they just out of a wardrobe trailer ) 2 . Incorrect ( Army officer  s rank insignia was upside down !) Not to mention the camp wearing . I when I saw the tanker wearing a wide brimmed pith helmet with US flight . He more like some kind of warped   soldier . Who did the military research ?! Why  t the tanker wearing tanker ? Or even the standard combat cap ?  t anyone watch the History Channel ? Overall , the film felt like a 1960  s era episode of  Combat  with cheesy . The nighttime running - battle between the  good guy  and  bad guy  was ! - - - - - Too bad , because it is an amazing story that deserved WAY better .",0
"A must see - Go watch it ! Color , Music , the Human Spirit - Best foreign film ever and best movie and acting of this year ! YES ITS IN ! NEEDS AN ! Why am I writing a long review on the web for people I don  t even know ? It  s the most amazing foreign made film I  ever seen ! I  m a big De and fan but this person ( logged on to check on his name ) is a magnificent actor ! I wonder if he  s like the character he  s in real life ! He surely my De and  s something to write about ! The story is based in in the 1800  s when they were a colony . The story around a character who becomes their first freedom fighter and is based on true history . This is no slow paced Ivory / Merchant movie and kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole length of the movie ( Its almost 3 . long !). Remember the Civil War movie  Glory ? This movie ( its cinematography ) me of that ( didnt realize those made such large scale ). The actor was superb - no dubbing , spoke excellent and amazing acting ! Toby the lead  s friend and a captain in the . He  s the same guy from the last 007 flick . What an actor ! This movie is about the human spirit - its about simple - its about the vivid colors of .

The rape scene is not intrinsic to the tiny smattering of plot that , nor is the gruesome , wantonly graphic and scene with the young lass in the necessary . When watching this film , one came away with the distinct feeling that some misogynistic and juvenile idiot had written and produced the film : such was the complete needlessness of the sexual violence within the movie .

"Well well well , never did i think that i would ever be able to sit through a film looking at Russel smug face and actually like him in it . This film certainly proved me wrong . I only saw this movie last night at a movie mystery night at the local cinema , you buy and don  t know what you are see . This me that Man was to be on nearly a whole month before its release . As someone who is not a fan of Russel i at the film as it was coming on , along with the sat next to me . However , within the first 20 this film really had me hooked . It is the true story of Jimmy , a been boxer who is now struggling through the depression , trying to support his family through the harsh times . He only one real shot at above water and this is by fighting again , so with the help of his coach , Joe , one more fight . This film really you behind the guy , i found myself almost throwing every punch in the last fight with him . Russel an absolutely wonderful performance as Jimmy , looking back i am still not sure whether he is more likable purely because he is being in the face a lot , with the cast around him also giving solid making the film a hit in this . It can only be a hit as i have nothing to moan about for",1
"Literary Appeal - One thing that I  m not about is that I  not any mention the setting and premise being close to H . P .  s  At the of Madness . is considered to be basically the horror writer of the 20th century , often the 20th century Allan Poe ;  At the of Madness , one of his three , is considered to be his masterpiece . The element of the film is something that will be by almost everyone . In my opinion , this is one of the movie  s strong ; the fact that the movie the two most recognizable hostile of pop culture together within this premise and setting . And the fact that this basis is esoteric . Philosophical / Meaning Value - Most also don  t think about the and philosophical side of a movie like  Alien , which is just as much horror as it is science fiction ( like  s work ). In  , when the expedition team is standing at the mouth of the cave , no one even suggest that maybe the hole in the ground . I really this element , because it like real life ; people don  t want to be considered crazy for suggesting that they believe in the possibility of this reality .  s mythos dealt greatly with the theme of mankind  s small place in this vast universe , and the fact that most human ignore this ... most people are probably just interested in the / rubber and familiar hero . One article I remember reading in a paper , with about how there was no or , so the movie must be terrible . The fact that the premise of the movie is based on a  of the  concept with the mixed - culture first civilization , is another strong point . And I  always the appeal of the Predator species being an ancient , advanced intelligent species that only on a primitive or basic society honor code to hold together their society . Pulp Appeal - Not every movie is  Citizen  or  of .   is supposed to be a modern day  ; and it is a great rendition of this concept of film . It is not the most intelligent movie ever made . Part of the basis comes from video and comic , not , but it still to have some level of depth and intelligence while still appealing to 12 - year - . Most comic book - based are just centered on action , and hero with fake . Production / Design - The flow of action and the do move at a somewhat slow pace ; this is one of the negative sides of the movie . But , the first  Alien  film does too . And  Predator , like  Alien , does not reveal the creature until toward the end . Both are some of the best creature ever . And the gestation of the was somewhat rushed ; but if you think about it , maybe the were genetically by the to grow faster ; they are certainly an advanced enough species . The that were lying around inside the derelict craft in  Alien  had been dormant for . The set design of the underground I thought was well and designed , along with the awesome queen chamber reminiscent of the comic . The with the Predator craft descending from the sky were awesome . The action and battle were well - executed and there was some level of and suspense ; but I agree with some who think there should have been a little more fighting between the two . The queen fight sequence at the ending was excellent , and I like the way the female figure  s role along with the comic series . The horror element I think was the helplessness of the being trapped in the middle of the struggle . Overall , I would give the movie about a 7 . 5 rating . A little bit of a slow and dry beginning . Some great esoteric appeal with the basis ( even though I  m not sure the team behind the movie intended this ), some level of depth and intelligence if you look for it , and a good comic book - based movie .",0
"I just watched this movie last night with all my , a group of people who some love scary and hate them . Everyone of my myself thought this movie was really good !

I love scary and I really this movie , in my opinion it  t that scary but still you some and every now and then . Even thought I  t , I was still hooked in by the plot and trying to solve the mystery . I suggest seeing this movie even if you are of scary , it  s a good one to see !!",1
"The best thing about this movie is Chad . He is so hot he could melt the House just by looking at it ! Apart from him there  t much to this . The special effects were cool and I did jump out of my seat about ten times but it  t really be classified as a horror . That said I have to admit I did have that night but I  m that down to the amazing job the make - up did on Vincent . He was seriously freaky looking ! It was hard to believe that Nick and were brother and sister  cos I kept them to rip each clothes off . The best death scene was  s , it was by far the most gruesome . I  t think that she would last that long and she  s not that bad an actress really . All in all it  t a bad movie and I actually it . It  s one of those you go see with a gang of your and you  t take it seriously for a minute . The last twist is great and I  t see it coming .",1
"I already had a user comment for  House of a 1 . 000  here on this site , over a year ago and um not very praising . In fact , my first of this film was so disappointing that I excessively other people here to see it . Rather than to simply ignore the old comment and pretend I never it , I wish to write a new \u2013 more positive \u2013 review , if it were only to convince other people ( who also at first ) to give it a second change . Several ( like the praising on  The Devil  s - sequel and with fellow horror ) nearly forced me to re - watch  House of a 1 . 000  and I  m glad I did . This truly is a film that multiple before one can properly judge it . Rob Zombie  s style is often and so overwhelming that it might look overly hectic at first but , in reality , his dedication towards obscurity and his knowledge on classic cinema is one of the best that could ever happen to the horror genre . And that is something you ( or at least I ) have to discover with repeated The power of this film in the fact that the screenplay all kind of successful horror . Serial , mad , a family of , deranged , devil - . you name the type of terror and  House of a 1 . 000  it ! This movie is a small revival of the entire horror genre all by itself . No extended and boring or pointless red in this film ,  House  is straightforward and sickness from start to finish and you  re given almost no time to breathe . Some of the in this film are so damn close to brilliant that I can  t possibly figure out why I  t love them right away !! The execution - scene by the moody  I Remember You - song , for example , is amazingly atmospheric and quite unsettling . Although Rob Zombie  s are still open for improvement ( the abrupt climax , overly rough ), his debut is a staggering that every horror fan to experience repeatedly ! Bring on the sequel I  m ready now !!",1

It is a hostage story within a hostage story , as , police chief and master hostage negotiator becomes himself a victim of extortion during a hostage taking situation . a character of compassionate cop , usually family man , into violence against his will , but when he is in , violence it is ! He is acting well in this role , the problem is that I lost count how many times he it in the last ten .

"What  s the name of the song when Bob and are coming home from the Karaoke party , and they pass by the bridge and the rest of downtown ? Lost In Translation was overall one of the best I  seen . did a masterful job of that perfect aura about the and their plutonic relationship perfectly over the course of the film , which is rich with cerebral music and inspiring , while revealing the true atmosphere of Japan throughout the film . The dialogue was perfect , and realistic resulting in the audience to feel a true empathy for two lost who temporarily find guidance in each .",1
"This movie really had potential . I had two big with it . First , it just a tad too slow . There is something to be said for not trucking along , but every scene included too much of people moving at snail speed , breathing heavily , waiting for the next scary moment . I did think it was interesting how it did not follow a chronological . The second aspect that I did not like was how everyone kept getting into the same stupid scary movie . In my opinion a well done scary movie should be one that people doing realistic . below : 1 . In the part where the detective went to burn the house , he should have known better by that point not to investigate any weird . 2 . was stupid to go to her apartment and be alone . She should have gone somewhere where she would not be alone . Anyways , I could list a million of these . I finished that movie completely upset .",1
"The Great Raid ----- August 12 , 2005 , a review by  Terry  , CA \u0096 In the near - empty Cinema , I gave myself the birthday gift of watching The Great Raid on opening night . This film , a chronicle of early 1945 in The , been highly in the U . S . Community , mostly by those of us who are fighting to achieve full equity for our . My , aunt and uncle me , as the initial documentary footage the historical of war and resistance , as if you were there over 60 ago . As , my made constant commentary throughout the film , as the brought back , often frightening , . Anxiously , she in soft of her bout with malaria , which meant sure death , until her father decided she would not be left behind , as they ran every day to escape the . Like the film  s prisoner of war , quinine was the saving prescription for my  s malaria - stricken body . The Great Raid is an army flick , similar to the I  seen in the past 50 . Less melodramatic , though powerful in its interpretation of the human condition during war , the movie you into a POW camp where 500 eke out survival under the flag . The acting was and reflected deep agony and despair without the flair of cinema - edged bravado . No or in this version . The casting was done with a sense of nuance for each of the heroic . The were gripping . The valiant of the underground that medicine to the ill and dying ; the array of authority in the military who made heart - about strategy and tactics ; the rescue mission that galvanized a unit of 120 special who had yet to see the extreme of combat ; the unlikely that bound in their fate . Some high of the painful , two and a half - hour mendacity you to the edge of your seat ----- the brutality of the , not the execution of ten for one escapee ; the burning funeral of a hundred , many of them and , near the Prison ; the spectacular , surprise invasion of the camp ; the courage of the and their exemplary warrior led by Captain , as their defense of a bridge the and their captive and effectively an avenue of to the and attack in their war camp . The of the fighting to liberate the were stark and many . The younger , especially those of descent , are to see what their homeland were made of . This long war was waged in face - to - face , hand - to - hand combat with bravery for duty and beyond . I went to see this as a way of my dad , a U . S . Army private , who , found his war bride , and fathered his first - born . I have deep respect and admiration for those like my Pop , who still live to tell their , who today are still struggling for full recognition of shed blood , sweat , and , at a time where their homeland the world  s . deserve Full Equity Now !####",1
"really the book by , I was really looking forward to this film . Overall , it was disappointing and I felt the story line from the book for no apparent reason and it was much the worse for it . The film in a great way ( although early from the book  s superior story don  t bode well ) but soon it becomes completely disjointed and difficult to fathom out why happen as they do . The ending is particularly weak and unbelievable which is a shame as ( sorry to go on about this ) the book  s ending is very good . The ? is superb and his acting is outstanding . A number of times his really come through which is unusual . Without him , the film  t be anything .",0
"Generally intended to be a satire . But it to me that they just  t go far enough in that direction . That  s , since that sort of movie is really hard to pull off . So , there were a hodgepodge of other dramatic and comedic . It was , at least , reasonably original , and some credit for that . Can  t really say that much about the acting . Nobody really stood out . It was all competent and professional , at least for this sort of film . There were a number of amusing running , such as the fake marine life , the way the crew went about casually armed , - ( ) frequently hanging about topless for no obvious reason , and the crew member often guitar , and singing Bowie in . Overall , I say it  s worth out .",0
"I have a hard time understanding the around this film . Really , what is the fuzz about ? It  s a well , easy going story about a couple of taking a grown - up vacation . One of them is on the verge to get married , and is on a rampage to consume his last days before marriage , the other is still not after a marriage , and is the virgin soul among the two . They will get involved with a couple of in wine country , the one who solidly involved will get - off ( physically and all ), the less involved one will become more involved , . The film never if it  s a comedy , a romantic story , or a good - life show . Maybe it  s a combination of the three , not a bad one , but this story about the of people with no is so boring , that the verbose wine production are some of the more exciting in the movie . The previous film of the director was  About , on the same line , but at least that one had the fabulous Jack acting . Again , not a bad film , professionally made , but minor completely devoid of any interesting story , , or subject . The fact that it was a contender only about a poor year in the cinema history , but why should we be taking into account that the big winner of the year was  Aviator .",0
"This script is an assassination of the , not an adaptation , and the only emotion is horror that the story I so dear as a child might have come to such an insipid and confused result . The other disappointing thing is that there are some genuinely good wasted here - the special effects are really well done , and both Eric and Bean give good of themselves in light of their material . Amongst the other , Peter O   s presence as only to remind us of what are capable when done well . and Bloom are insipid , flat and downright annoying , and Cox is one - dimensional , but their are written that way . They never had a chance . I almost forgot Brad as . His character is just that memorable .",0

The movie is one unfunny penis joke after another as you can see from the poster . These people ought to be ashamed of themselves . Wasting their time on this awful piece of trash .

The fact also that at one point in the film in another back and forth they went , and the fact that the scarred one you know second to die the fat one , the fact that he / she / it  t that the Alien had acid blood is quite stupid considering they were meant to be hunting these every 100 and so i would have thought they would  caught onto the idea that they have acidic blood . There are more bad , but even so despite all the i this film , i mean Bishop , Maxwell and i them 3 really like there acting the rest well utter rubbish quite frankly . But then comes the , and this time they a lot ( i know digital ) AND you could kind of relate to the , no their need to kill but you actually had an Alien who you you know the one i mean , cross hatch head , again the fact that , that alien 1 Predator is amazing but even so the alien no character . Plus the fight between alien and predator , although so unbalanced at each fight it still was a great sight to see i love every minute of it . so really they should have put more time , REAL and balanced it out more but even so i still will watch this many times just for those fight , just to see the Predator chop an head off . Just for that experience",0
"I admit that after seeing several bad for this movie , I was prepared for something very bad when I went to watch it . Maybe it was partly due to the fact that my had been , but I actually quite the show . The plot a bit from the book - the main difference was actually the existence of a plot - but most of it loyal to  original masterpiece . True , some did not make it to screen , among them some of my from the novel , but the movie made up for it with new more to the film medium . In my opinion , the humour in the movie lay not so much in the themselves , which admittedly  t always very good , but more in the overall - out craziness of the and universe . Those who have not yet read the , however , might not  get  most of the movie , because it quite a bit on the audience at least a vague idea of what is happening in order to keep track of the story . There are also a few in - around that only would understand , so it would probably be a good idea to read the book before watching the show . One of the I  t like in the show was the sudden addition of the love - triangle subplot , because it did not seem to fit in with the original spirit of the book - but I  m generally a person who  t like romance much , so perhaps my opinion here might be slightly . Overall , the movie was a fun ride that went beyond my . The cast was great and brought the to life , the music was great - singing ; what more could you ask for ? - and the script was a nice adaptation of print to screen . It could have been better , but it still remains a worthy addition to the Hitchhiker  s franchise . Seven .",1
"This documentary , written , directed , and by German madman maestro , very little in it that  t worth seeing , and at its best some of the most captivating , candid , and entertaining documentary footage of the year . The subject matter is an environmentalist / bear nut Timothy , a nobody who a kind of weird celebrity for living each summer on an wildlife preservation with Grizzly . He also a lot of his time on the island , which wisely for his film on him . may or may not have totally a fate like death among his - would come ( there is one scene where he he  d die for them , another when he he  s safe ). But his fate did come , along with his , rather grisly as we hear from the ( which , wisely , we never see ). One is to comment on , as he is ( much as with  s in his fiction ) possessive , ambitious , naive , dazed , emotional , but somehow in tune with his own sense of nature and the ways of the world . himself a good deal on , when he with him , when he  t ( , as Roger pointed out , does have a bleak world - view as opposed to  s overly optimistic one ). What one can comment on is the execution of the material . We get with  s close ( one , one not ), the people who found his and his  s in the forest , and a couple of nearby ( one Native on how did what they had never done in 7 , 000 , to cross a boundary that was ). also us majestic , spacious of wilderness , and some ample time for footage of the and . If not for  s rather high & low nature ( as a friend ), this might be a very standard documentary on a bear expert . But because of the documentary - or near television hosting footage ( I sometimes felt like I was seeing a , if stranger version , of the Croc )- of on camera by himself , the film another dimension . It  s also a help that in the grim reality of what of him (  s narration is this rather sad , if praising side ), it  s rather funny to see in his behavior on screen . In some subtle ways he  s in a more  normal  state of mind than the rest of us - he his ( whom , by the way , he gave to ; he his ground against the occasional ); he that mix of sentimentality and rawness that is to live for so long in the wilderness . The absurdity of it usually the , but even behind them there is always a constant curiosity about him . We learn that he to be an actor , which lead to a bad , near fatal spell before his  bear  retreat , acting as more of a spiritual catalyst more than anything else . Even if some of this footage is a little zany , over - the - top , or may go far on his name , it is honest to a kind of degree . We almost  t want to be normal , and go figure - would have no interest in him . In the end , despite  s ( which  t the best of the film to me ), his film not to pass judgment on , his and other speak for themselves . And , if nothing else , it  s compulsively ( for a certain movie - viewer ) watchable .",1
"sorry if i sound like I  m talking from every which way but i am writing this little comment just shortly after watching this debacle of a film . might i say that in my opinion this movie is crude , insulting , disgusting , humiliating , undignified and so on ... in every way that down the human race .. even going as far as showing that we are no better than or if not even worse . every second was another gruesome sex related joke being fully seen on the good  theater screen . the language was filthy with sexual every other second , and the screen was trite with sexual content . Oh and the plot itself ... beyond inane ! if i  t there with my friend i would have left the theater about 20 into the film . If that is all that rob schneider can do to attempt to make an audience laugh then he needs to give it up along with the and and just go into the industry if they are that with sex that much . ill be the first to say this comment  t very useful .. but its my opinion on how low come or the movie industry in general ... about sex in a movie like this every second like we just it . if you have the bit of decency in you ..... DON  T SEE THIS FILM ! thank you for reading this",0
"What a difference a day , just like in real life . This film a lot of emotional territory and does it better than I  seen in a very long time . And we see a lot of days that make a big difference . My hat  s off to Mike Binder for writing a story that is full of vastly different , interesting , but true that somehow find a comfort zone with each other and for them speak the rest of us might only think . is amazing in the role of a woman caught in an intersection of life and not knowing which way to turn . She is angry , hurt , and  t really want to think about tomorrow . could easily take to her bed but she four who each are on the brink of their own and the mix of their as a partial outlet for her anger keep her from going over the edge into the abyss of screaming . We are informed that  s character was always so sweet until the current crisis , and that her and temporarily - rude behavior believable and acceptable . We can surmise that her previously sweet personality and the sense of humor we glimpse from time to time are among the she such loving now when she needs them .  s range of comedic and dramatic are like the of a diamond in this performance . finally become a genuine actor in his role as a - yes , again - baseball player , though now retired . I  never been a big fan of his , but this movie made one of me . His is a complex portrait of aging male - ness . His acceptance of his lot in life , his honesty , and his desire to hold onto his integrity are all in the relaxed but confident way he with  s family . A lot of describe his character as an alcoholic , but I strongly disagree . He to cocktail to take the edge off , but he is never disgustingly drunk and there are many showing him sober , rational , and not drastic personality . His character is actually the man all single over 40 are looking for and can never find : playful , assured , good looking in a mature way , boyish in other ways , financially secure with an interesting past , cognizant of the meaningful in life , and not skirt - chasing 20 year . I wonder if Binder such a guy because he drew him with such sincerity . When a big chunk of his life is yet to come , that  s what a home run   like . I  never seen so much in - the - skin of a role . It  t look like he  s acting which is what acting is all about ,  t it ? Mike Binder took a chance casting himself in the role of the sleazy producer , but he  s simply terrific . I believe he thought he knew best how to play this role because he just the right amount of without too much ego and he it . In most , his character would be the one we love to hate because it would have been written with a harder edge , but not here . I had sympathy for him because you could see the  search for self - esteem  and his total lack of awareness about how to actually achieve it written all over him . The dialogue and the are intelligent and swept me into their world and though the financially affluent environment at first did not ring true , it ultimately was a relief not to have the lack of money thrown in as another driver for the story . A lot of in this genre tend to get hysterical by every darn stinking piece of bad luck imaginable . In this story there is just enough going on and rich people , by the way , do have crises , too . The is nearly perfect giving us generous of the secondary  to get nicely rounded out but not gorge us with and delay the main . We learn enough to engage us in the rhythm of the main household . The musical score is in perfect pitch with the screen action and the film like a soft cushion of feeling . It  s there at every turn , gently sliding into your consciousness to underline the plot . You will laugh , you will worry , you  think you know something , and you  be over and over again ... just like real life . And like real life , you  end up with hope . I vote all around : ( the bar this year !) and ( surprise !) for acting and Binder for best original screenplay ... or , dare I say ?, best picture . Talent and originality shine like the blazing sun in this flick . Note to Mike Binder : I dream that you have another story like this one in you . 9 out of 10 .",1
"Bale is one of the best . It me how he was until this year considering his performance in a numerous number of terrific ( . , Equilibrium ). This year , due to both Machinist and the new Batman movie , are at last looking better ! This movie is not an easy one . It is disturbing and many times but a logical and unexpected plot . It basically a story of how bad conscience and loneliness may affect a human mind . A psychological thriller at its best ! The performance of Bale is top - notch as always . Score : 9 of 10 .",1
"Overall I this movie . It me a lot of , nothing to do with supernatural but the inner - of a person . In fact , that can be so much . The Machinist is a bit and more violent that Hitch , but the of man himself ( without that realization ) is certainly there . The movie is about . He  s a guy who works with heavy machinery , with a call girl , and to really like sticky and bleach . Overall leading a simple life . However , it  s obvious that this guy had some serious . For one , he a body that concentration camp could envy , people keep telling him ,  If you were any thinner you  t exist . I  d have to agree with those people , as I found one of the most disturbing of the film to be bale  s body . Then there  s also the fact that he to not slept for the last year , although he consistently of being tired . Why ? Well , that what the film is about . What is the cause of his insomnia ?",1
"What a great movie this out to be ! It a story of two and their last vacation together in  s wine country . The two are some sort of yin - yang composition . Both are as semi - but the difference is that only one of them ( i . e . ) is aware of it . This movie works on so many . Most often it out to be a comedy although sometimes the humor is not explicitly available for the viewer . Sometimes it is a drama and sometimes it is a feel - good experience . The of Sideways are the cast and the . My favorite :  Jack : If they want to drink , we  re drinking . : No , if anyone , I  m leaving . I am NOT drinking any ! My favorite scene : opening the old bottle of wine in the fast - food restaurant . Score : 10 of 10",1
"This was a very good movie in my opinion . I think that the acting was great and was really great but the story was not . It was a little bit of a disappointment because it  t make enough sense . It through at the ending but a few were unanswered . It did have many but thats another problem . It  t make you really think during the movie . some were out there too much and they tried to make it look like it was hard to understand but through a lot of the movie it  t . I think the were an A +! They were terrific ! I suggest you watch this movie with but at the same time just be willing to enjoy the movie . I it and say that you should watch it if you  watched the first one and are in for a scare and a surprise . It is sometimes and the story sense sometimes but sometimes  t . Rent it first , if you like it , buy it .",1
"I had very high from this movie . It lived up to most of them . I found it to be extremely well handled { Kudos to the director }. The acting was quite brilliant and the whole movie a great punch . But even this time as always Khan carried the movie through and through . He was just superb . His emotion , his fanaticism and his change in the movie is just brilliantly . The movie does have its . It a bit towards the end . One song in particular could have been . The have shown great depth and development . Toby as a huge applause . He off a great performance . There is a little touch to the movie , some are stereotypical . The other are perfectly cast . The use of in the movie was excellent . They are very well into the story . Overall , I think it is an Intelligent film . I think it will be very well accepted by the .",1
"A perfect example of great , great , more money and a little of script . The - interval of the movie is quite boring with lots of song and dance and little of substance . The one after the another is brought into the film but the movie still remains at the same position . Worse is the voice - over which after sometime becomes a bit irritating . Rani is wasted in the role as . Less said of Patel the better . Even if one both the , there  s  t going to be any difference in the movie . Could have been a better movie had more focus on the revolt was . Goof : In version of the movie , when the Regiment comes , the person leading the regiment is shown speaking in to his .",0
"It  s hard to go into Hostage anything other than just an entertaining thrill ride , and that  s all I went into the movie . To my surprise , however , the movie to fall massively short of my low . I really don  t know what went wrong , as like this tend to make themselves . The central plot of a hostage negotiator , turned police chief , to go back to hostage after a family is captive by a bunch of is neither original or particularly clever , but if done with enough pastiche and imagination ; it could , and , lead to great . There  s very little imagination here , though , and instead we  been given a thick layer of melodrama and more sentiment than the average family drama . The music , the acting , the way that the plot out and the script all contribute to making this film feel more like an opera than a thriller , with all the wearing their on their and to the point of sheer annoyance . I  never been in a hostage situation before , but if I was - I  m pretty damned sure I  t be dripping with sentimentality ! All this sentiment and melodrama is the film  s downfall , as it it very hard to take seriously . More include a convoluted plot , a very irritating and . I actually quite like , but his performance here is under - wrought and it very much like he  t really be . I don  t blame him - with that script , I  t be either ; but if he  d put his back into it a bit more , the film might have ended up good instead of rubbish . Director Florent to want the film to straddle the line between film noir and comic book , as the opening suggest , but he neither . The action is very over the top , and that could be to the action in a comic book , but it  s not a comparison that any weight as it  s just not exciting , and when you  got slow motion walking through a petrol bombed house , it  s pretty clear that you  re watching a very silly film . The might have thought that as a draw would be enough to make this film decent - but it  t . made a lot of bad over his career - and this is one of them .",1
"An excellent movie a REAL event . A well war yarn that is not over the top . This is the way should be made . did a great job as did the entire cast . If you are looking for , , Lean , or big dollar this movie is not for you . If you are interested in a SOLID film based on a war even this movie will definitely satisfy . Let  s face it there are very few war made these days and this one is TOPS . Henry  s character as well as the 6th preparation for the raid could have been better but the overall of this historic event is well done .",1
"The Great Raid a beginning , a middle and an end . Tightly and well by all concerned . A well turned look at a military action that was forgotten and only by those who  s were on that day . It  s poor reception by is a puzzle and why it sat in the can for three is an unknown . The and the are the in this movie . The action is stark and without pity although the  love  story was a slight distraction but the intent was to show that for many , the were not forgotten and would be even though the response was normally brutal and without mercy . The audience that the picture with my wife and I were mostly older military and many cried at what was being . Most stayed until all the movie were , something one normally  t see . This is a must see movie because the raid was true and this movie it well . The 500 US freed by this raid had been forgotten by all except the 6th Ranger . .",1
"Here comes another sequel to a classic comedy Deuce : Male Gigolo . If anybody ever to see an 80 minute penis joke , then this movie is definitely for you . The first film which came out about 4 ago gave us a new concept and us to the most memorable . In fact , it is one of my favorite . In the sequel we learn that been eaten by ( what a terrible way to kill off somebody ) and that T . J . is working in . Somebody is killing off all male in one by one . T . J . on Deuce to help him find out who is the serial killer by becoming a man - whore decoy . From the very beginning to the last minute of the movie virtually every line a penis joke ... While some are funny , they are very repetitive and at times offensive . If you watch many carefully , it like the whole movie was done in front of the blue screen . This film is another proof not to make of great .",1
"I just watched The Great Raid in the theater in this afternoon . I  t be more touched by the story , and the movie confirmed my respect to the for their contribution and sacrifice . I am a . In China , we were taught to remember the horrible atrocity that army to us during their mass invasion into China in . However the Communist Party that they were the liberator of people and the war because they just to benefit from the war by selling and taking control . After I came to , I learned and more about . Not long , I that that was a despicable lie . It was that made the sacrifice of and blood , saved us from being and brought the peace to us . Without fighting against and , no nation could ever take them out from our map and nobody could imagine how long we had to be for them . nothing but honor from the people around world for their engaging in . Nowadays , the United have possessed the most powerful military force and political influence in the world . I hope that today  s young remember their as much as we do , they will continue to stand for liberty , justice , humanity and freedom in front of the world , just like their !",1

Too much dark photography ,  t hold the interest enough ... mainly due to bad acting and choppy . It got on my  s the little girl continually crying ,  Mommy , help me , mommy , help me . About 15 before the ending , it my  s attention , but , the ending itself , she found totally stupid . If the story was strong enough , maybe the rest of the could have been - but , it  t , so it  t . Enough said ...",1
"I watched this movie a light - hearted comedy . I the additional complexity added to the by Mac and . Both did an excellent job in their , the realistically rather than over - the - top . Mac and are definitely the highlight of this film . This film the issue of race , particularly the interaction between whites and in the U . S . Such is an inflammatory topic and the deserve credit for tackling the topic without partisanship . It is for comedic effect at times but ultimately is with respect . But I was disappointed that the female in the film were written as manipulative and deceptive . Whereas the arc Mac a man struggling to come to with the conflict between his love for his daughter and his on race , the female are shown as and inauthentic . This surprisingly misogynistic message with the tone of the film .",1
"This movie is an unique movie that I would describe as a  character comedy . This is not a comedy with forced humor in it , it is a comical , yet ordinary observation of two different people in a strange foreign world , who are growing more and more towards each other . The humor and warm feeling of the movie is in the every day and the strange but yet realistic . This movie is just like real life ; slow and not every thing is always making sense or explanation . Sometimes just happen , whether you like it or not . This is a movie that heavily on its two main by and Bill , two totally different who yet are   to each other . It  s obvious that at lot of in the movie were , especially in the Bill . But somehow director to restrain ( something that most definitely is not an easy thing to do ) and him into the character she want him to be . The fact that perhaps the role of his life is thanks to  s . and should definitely make more together in the future . It  s logical that this movie received an nomination for best picture , since this type of movie is new and yet works so well and so familiar and honest . I  m sure of it that in the near future we will get to see more like  Lost in Translation  being made . Perhaps not the must see everyone you believe it is but still an unique , warm movie experience that surely is recommendable for everyone to watch , at least once . are you  either end up totally loving it , or it . 8 / 10http :// bobafett1138 . . /",0

"The majority of i tend to watch are for the sole purpose of entertainment , but however when the magic of that film stays with long after the film finished then it indeed its purpose . is a film that does that for me , this film drew me into a world where nothing is what it like at all , we are taken on journey where i believe we experience the chaos theory and we are told that everything that we do a consequence . The film it - self a sense of humour but also that certain level of being creepy . With a twist that is added on to every level of the film up to the climax leaving people a little dazed and confused . This film is certainly not one to view just for entertainment as it will probably get you thinking a lot and it is not for people with a short attention span as you have to follow it very carefully . However i defiantly recommend this film , add this to your to watch before i die list .",1
"s Eternal Sunshine is a brilliant piece of film - making . The story is told in such an original , yet charming and emotionally manner that one basically no choice but to feel for these . Its the story of a man ( ) who in love with an who suddenly like she  t know him . The film is superbly written ,  s screenplay is finer and here than in Adaptation or of a Dangerous mind , . The also make this film , and are absolutely perfect in the , both deserve last year if you ask me . Also two who i usually do not like much in Dunst and Wood are at the absolute best here ( partially due to them , mostly due to the great script ). Mark was a highlight for me , never have i seen him be a character so good , he was my most memorable performance of the film . was also great , the role of a doctor . This film is beautiful , with great music , direction and extremely good chemistry . This is one of rare love story type that i love , saw it twice just this week . 10 / 10 # 50 on my list of all - time favorite",0
"I am from and i  t believe what my were seeing !!!!! Is not that hard go to or to an encyclopedia and search a little bit about the country that you are going to make a movie in !!! review some : we don  t have !, we have , , ... but not !!:( We don  t have ! We don  t have Maya  s !! we never had ! We don  t have ! We don  t have ! We don  t look like people from or Bolivia . Anyway i have to say that for a moment it was funny ;) see all this and he he he . But at the same time i felt a little from the director of this movie because he had no idea what he was talking about . I have no idea what they were trying to do , they a place to make their movie but they cant just invent a culture and a geography and people and a government to a country that already !! If you want to invent a new country its for me but don  t put the name of mine in your non place . it is very disrespectful to all south the fact that free to say and show absolutely everything that they want about us . so for your next movie just try to be a little more informed ?",1
"This Movie was not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be . In fact I even sort of it . It of pretty weak , apparently is the only person in the world to be able to predict a huge storm that is going to change the climate and the world forever . What such a storm , pollution . Of course the US government him ,  t you , and terror . This movie is basically a run of the mill natural disaster movie with with descent special effects . Nothing all that special , but if you enjoy natural disaster you will probably like this one . The movie would have been way better had and had at the very beginning and the homeless man was trapped in with a bunch of .

The screenplay is superb , great character that we can all relate to . The direction was quite beautiful and with a suitable and graceful score . The acting was great as well , , and Jean all gave great . Phoenix  t have many but was great as well . I  t particularly like  s performance too much , a bit wooden in this one to me .

"In 2 : Don  t Bother I  t go into this film looking for Citizen , but looking for some , as well as the usual off - color humor . What I  t expect is the baseless ridicule of handicapped people . I saw a film that had poor acting , inept sexual humor , worn - out , and overall , an immature plot that got worse as the movie went on . Deuce ( Rob Schneider ) to to avoid the police after his invention havoc with some and blind senior . What a great way to start a movie : blind people getting by ! to assist his pimp friend ( Griffin ) who is falsely accused of being a serial murderer , mixed up with the Inspector  s daughter ( Hanna ) who ( Obsessive Compulsive Disease ) and is put up for ridicule each time she a seizure . Its supposed to be funny , but the mark completely and fun of those that may be by this disorder . Many of the   were just plain wrong . Leave out the Penis - nose and the throat hole .

This a gem of a movie and easily alongside Raging Bull with fight that make you wince . The other are equally superb and how this film out on I have no idea it is criminal that it was and more criminal if you miss a piece of movie brilliance . You will definitely not be disappointed it was like watching the and riches story of Rocky only it is a true story and the acting is top drawer . Russel does the character of great credit and does a great job in making you feel that you were there with the of the depression and the feeling of hope and this film you with every kind of emotion from start to finish - it is simply a gem .",1
"the young character does an outstanding , passionate performance as a young girl falling in love for Gosling as the young the right chemistry for the audience for us to share in this experience . Their us into their passion , their love . This is balanced out with Gena and Garner the of the older couple as the older and the Duke later on in of their relationship . As the story is told about their life , seeing their love for one another develop , seeing their passionate love grow for one another is wonderful to share in this cinematic experience , more than once . Another film comes to mind is  The Family Man  where Cage and Tea are great together with their love for each other but in a different context .",1

The is abrupt and just simply ridiculous , they have taken an important event in history and turned it into a badly made movie . The seem to come out of a high school play . There is no weight for any of the . You feel nothing for them . All of them feel so fake and empty .

"STAR RATING : ***** The Works **** Just the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The In an attempt to spice their marriage up , a young couple ( and Travis ) head off on a - diving expedition to the . However , this will prove to be the biggest mistake they ever made . The incompetent diving crew fail to include them in the head - count and they are left in the middle of the ocean . It becomes a desperate struggle for survival to make it back to dry land in one piece . I  d this film already , but the to process my for some reason ! Anyway , enough of that , this is my new review . Although Open Water is not a movie without it  s , I am quite of the Blair Witch style use of camera and style . A problem for me might have been that there  t enough exciting and scary stuff happening , but on the other hand I suppose this did sort of add to the tension and atmosphere of the whole experience . The gradual build - up of the tension is quite well done , especially for such a short movie . The movie also some fine cinematography and some beautiful of the ocean , especially in it  s blue form . Overall , the lack of eventful stuff happening is sort of a spanner in the works , but this is undeniably a well - made and cleverly movie that a wide audience that it  s low budget feel might not aim it at . ***",1

Morgan Freeman in the role of Sam the blind piano player and his step daughter by Kerry take this movie down to the level of an evangelist moral play .

"With less than stellar , I did not expect much . Instead I found the movie quite enjoyable . was wonderful as always and Will at least suitable . The original was , although often nervous , a mellow character to Will , but this role him to be several different and he admirably . As a huge fan of the original show , I would have been satisfied with a remake following the original plot . Again , I was pleasantly by the with its interesting and creative introduction of all the familiar . Not everything worked perfectly , but it was certainly a good effort . Finally , was sensational . When I first she was going to be ( or in this case , ), it was immediately obvious that she would be perfect , and she was . She been remarkable this year . The was not a brilliant remake , but without , it would have been unimaginably horrible . Without to other , current or past , I can easily say that she is on top of her game and among my all time .

"This will likely be the most modest review you  read of this film in the first few of a sea of 10s . I nonetheless , am convinced a 7 is the highest the film . a unique film about the of four into a chaotic conclusion due drug addiction . However , his reliance on an extreme , hyperbolic film the movie  s appeal . The film to be an example of pushing the simply for the sake of pushing , as no real message . It would be similar to calling a horror movie a  classic  because the director a bloody decapitation after bloody decapitation or a romance movie being considered a  classic  because it 1 / 2 hour of real sex . Nonsense . The best are the that leave the gory or gruesome to the imagination yet leave you with an extraordinary impact and a message . I really got no message from the film which is heavily on torturing four miserable again and again .... and again and again . What  s the point ? The four main in the film are phenomenal . surprisingly a stunning break out performance for someone known for starring trivial and mediocre pop culture . He may have given the best or second best performance of the four . a credible performance as a desperate and loyal forced to do unthinkable sex . The are their modesty and ability to succumb themselves to the most possible . The music of the film is memorable . The film one main theme song , but it is the most memorable and theme song ever I  ever . I it immediately after the film . The music the tone of the film . The major weakness of the film , despite the great acting , are the . There  s no about it , the are pure . The fact that they  re leaves me little ability to sympathize with them , and I was trying my . Furthermore , despite other to paint them as  tragic , the main are not in any form . It  s even a stretch to suggest that they  re good people . For instance ,  s character initially an older man simply to get money .  s character his mother repeatedly by selling her television set . Yes , they all do this to subdue their addiction .. but the term hero cannot be thrown around aimlessly . They  re simply dubious . Yeah , they try to aim to get out of the drug culture and start prosperous . The have great chemistry with each other , they are somewhat slightly charismatic , but they don  t do anything remotely generous or pious in the film to warrant praise as  tragic . You can watch this film and immediately see the end coming . Part of you naively and helplessly the film a sudden right turn into , but that is simply not the case . might tease you in the beginning , but he you to the most overly dramatic conclusion like a car into a brick wall . Ironically , while many  The Passion  for torture and of again and again and again and again over other of ( and rightly so , that film its as well ), it surprising these praise similar of repetitive  how can it get any worse  torture done to rather shady nonstop . I  m not saying this film a happy ending to be a good movie . But if it a tragic ending , it should have a message . If it  s just  don  t do , than that  s a grave disappointment and waste of time for a supposedly deep experimental film . To his credit , the director a neat and impressive artistic style known as  hip hop montage . The spinning was a but a great asset to the film . This film I guess is worth a watch once . But once is only time I  seen it , and I  never sit through that film all the way through again . Period . I  m pretty confident in saying that most of those  10s  people have only seen it once and will make an excuse not to see it again . The only people who will see this film again are overly depressed and eccentric , pessimistic .... A classic to be more than a overly nihilistic novelty act .",1
"from a facility and for a month . He was found dead from a shotgun to his head in the green house of his stone walled mansion in the middle of the forest .

Blake is not , and it is him at the same time . Blake is a young man who his time , be it day or night , silently , nature , thinking , but at the same time he  s walking aimlessly , mumbling every word , the few people that are around him , supposed that only want him because of what he . What he we don  t know though , or we do , because we know who was . And if you don  t know who he was then this is not a movie for you . Blake , and he perfectly . From the dirty blonde hair to the voice that the sound of Nirvana . The look is incredible and it  s great because we don  t get a close up to Blake  s face up until the final of the movie . Before that we always get his face covered by hair of from an angle that  t let us see it . And there  s something worth that could decide if you go see this movie or not : as I Blake a lot in the movie , and it  s not just a lot , is all of it . There are no fully understandable coming out of his mouth during the entire movie . There are two classic Nirvana  s sound ( not music though , there  s none of that in the movie ). First there  s a scene in which Blake , guitar , bass and , no though . Van Sant us this scene from outside the house through a big window , and you can just see Blake  s mind , music . The second scene is excellent , in which one of the that  s in Blake  s house comes to him for help on a song . He to Blake , and even him a tape , but Blake just and , he  s lethargic and no energy it . The guy leaves , and Blake a guitar and and singing .  s ( or whoever it was , though he in a band in real life so it could  been him ) voice just like  s , and the music is the perfect underground sound of Nirvana . This is not a traditional movie , it  t follow any of the classic . It  s literally a following of what to this rocker , and to ( Van Sant even  s original broadcast of the news of  s death ) in his Last Days , filled with nothingness , probably just thinking who he is and what he , though maybe not . And just like with , there  s no explanation or of his death , just Blake  s last put on paper :  I can  t keep going . I can  t be part of this machine . I  m sorry .. This is not the movie I was to see about , it  s better , and I salute Van Sant for his beautiful work with it .",1
"# 1 Pointless . There was no discernible plot . Wait actually there was , sort of : people illicit , and then ... and then I don  t know . Basically this movie was 4 people adulterous .

It did give me a low point to compare other to though ...  well , at least it is not as bad as  Closer .",0
"This movie is dreadful . It place in with endless unfunny about nudity and hash / marijuana . Whatever charm and surprise in the first movie is totally gone in this sequel . For example , Griffin  s boat with the water on the floor - nothing is done with the setup . Concerning the , it is clear who  did it  in the opening ten . The only joke I at was about Griffin passing gas at an inopportune moment in the  library . When passing gas is the highlight of the film , you know you have a dog . And all the about with is now old and actually sad in that we are now reduced to laughing at who have physical or mental . , really funny stuff ! If you are stupid or a .

"Just saw the movie yesterday . Its Awesome . In addition to the historical , the movie also to address a lot of contemporary and in rousing at every occasion . Amir worked a lot on his , however his accent does not do full justice to the role . The real star of the movie is Toby . He put a lot of effort in the role and his in like a pro . : Besides Mangal mangal , other are average . Direction : could have done a little extra in some of the exciting in the film such as Mangal  s entry and the climax when he is executed . The movie a global message of rebellion against oppression and will fit well with a lot of and around the globe . The movie not received very good in the US , but received a standing in .

"*** NO *** I saw the movie at a sneak preview in , on 6 / 23 / 05 . I was just happy that we were getting more of these and this setting . Visually , it was stunning . The extra budget for effects was well spent . The and their were recognizable , but there had been from the show . I think this was necessary within the movie , and part of an evolution from the show to the big screen ( the movie place 6 after the last episode ,  in Space ). have . There is a higher action and violence level in this ( , it  s a movie , not on ), and we get some major about the world ( which some who saw it with me already don  t like ).

"I think the director and the script were a bad match . The dynamic shooting style that he so brilliantly applied to City of God inappropriate in service of this rather conventional , overlong , dialogue - driven international thriller . Extreme camera and are favored over acting and interpersonal drama . These are great , but they  been better in other . I don  t think the director is quite up to the task of a mature ,  adult  film . And the script is a bit of a mess as well . Too much preachy , naive & on - the - nose dialogue . And the dialogue is doing too much of the dramatic heavy lifting : too much of the crucial action is off - screen or merely to in dialogue instead of SHOWN On screen ! It felt like a rough draft of what could have been a much better script .  character is not very well defined , so when the movie from being her story to his , we  re not attached enough to him to care . And there is no real suspense or mystery to his journey : we already pretty much know everything there is to reveal . This to an insufferably boring and overlong second half . So much talent here , but and an script sink it . Don  t buy the self - important , this one  t deliver .",0
"The version of this movie is some 180 + . The length at time The song especially the song is just inappropriate , the movie would be slicker without it . Also at times it the movie is dragging , though the final 30 are worth watching . Overall an amazing performance by Amir Khan and Toby . Rani and have hardly got a role , except for some dance sequence on Rani . The film could very well do do without the and also a more would have made it slicker . The background score by A . R . is good . The direction and story are also very good . The film is worth watching once , but don  t know how many would want a second to it . Overall a decent film .",1
"The rising is basically yet another cruel manipulation of history in order to woo back lost film . The director himself is unable to portray a definite genre . It is a history tale with flashy colors , music and meant to hit hard on any patriot . The truth is Amir Khan  s long exile from filmdom a which he was not able to live up to . The movie of with a of a friendship between Amir and an army man . The slapstick comedy sequence when they both get drunk is another example of how have to evolve . However Amir had put up a commendable performance and a constant tempo throughout the film . Rani was trying her hand at being a - independence glam doll and though fictitious she her character quite well . Patel was just pathetic . They banish her from the face of cinema ( the counterpart of duff or lohan who cant act ). The audio dubbing had which made certain sound like from a live play . The unnecessarily bright and dance deviate from the core concept of the film . All the did their well . The fact that the version of the movie a lot of make us doubt if the movie was made to appeal to the patriotic . i think have to do their movie homework before shooting something . i doubt if the water spray gun used in the song was even in 1857 . The music score by A . R . too could not save this sinking ship . An advice to : make a flawless watchable movie without any and surely the people will appreciate . I have seen an excellent original movie in . The industry is more interested in the glam and the money . What to the good ? history to unacceptable is not the sign of a good movie or a good director . Unfortunately i am not to write for the film else i would have had a lot to write . of course the film its own share of plus such as patriotic devour , good music , good cast but sadly the overshadow them to a great extent which  the rising  a disappointment of the highest order .",0

"2005 , for me been a good year for horror , with the exception of The Ring 2 . I thought House of Wax was a very entertaining slasher flick , with a theme other than just a deranged serial killer . This movie had a great teen cast which included , Chad , and the one and only . While I was some pitiful acting , the acting really  t that awful and even did exceptionally well . Although it obvious of what was about to occur to each character , the were still great . At many I found myself thinking  how will they escape ? or  where will they hide ?. there was no nudity in this movie but did strip down into her lingerie . This movie was also gory and had great death . It a finger cut off , decapitation , skin turned to wax , skin peeled , a rusty pole through the head , a knife in the throat , a baseball bat , and quite a few foot . If this all appealing to you , I would be sure to see this movie in the future , like when it comes out on , which may include actress Emma Lung  s death scene .",1

"- Park  s revenge opus certainly with a bang as we meet the film  s anti - hero Oh Dae - ( Min - ) holding a man over the edge of a tower block by his tie . What we see \u0096 or what we think we see \u0096 is misleading , however , and us an appropriate introduction to Park  s remarkable yet flawed saga . The opening scene a much later , pivotal , moment that the key to the entire mystery , and neatly one of the of \u0096 the passing of time , its resonance , the power with which control of another person  s time us , the manner in which what is a trivial moment in time for one person can be the irreversible beginning of life - tragedy for another . is also a study of revenge , of its nature , and of the way vengeance can destroy the person who it more completely than the person on whom it is intended . Immediately after the opening scene Park us back fifteen to meet a much different Oh Dae - ; an overweight drunken buffoon to the wall of a police station because of his disruptive behaviour . out by a friend , Dae - during the course of a telephone conversation , and to find himself in a prison cell decked out like a cheap hotel room . This room will be his home for a decade - and - a - half during which his only contact with the outside world is via . He his time by keeping a journal in which he all his previous and the people with whom he come into conflict , by his against the of his cell , and by his escape thanks to an additional chopstick with his meal one day . Then , just as he is about to make his escape , Dae - is from a suitcase as if being reborn into the world , he himself on the grassy roof of a tower block that the street from which he was . On the is a man suicide \u0096 which is where we came in Dae -  s ultimate failure to escape from his prison a precedent that throughout the movie : he in everything he out to achieve , largely because he is just a puppet \u0096 the target of revenge , not its architect . are probably the most inventive in the world at present . Unlike  s , which too often find themselves by their fear of the influence of outspoken pressure and moralistic politics , are free to explore \u0096 and show \u0096 from which would shrink ( which leaves one fearful for the quality of the remake of this film ). This film is typical of that creative freedom . The violence is both and sadistic , and is often as of a viscerally epic nature ( such as the one - take sequence in the corridor of Oh Dae -  s former prison ) or coolly balletic ( as in his encounter with a gang of street ). Park  s camera greedily on a close up of a gangster  s teeth being extracted with a claw hammer , and we are to a scene of Oh Dae - tearing the head off a live squid and manfully as its shiver and curl around his mouth . And yet this violence never gratuitous or out of place . While , when upon with a studied eye , the corridor fight - scene is more than a little unbelievable , by it Park is true to the film  s Manga . Like the in those comic , the in seem to operate on the periphery of a world that only a passing resemblance to our own . While this it easier for us to accept some of the more far - fetched of the plot , it also us emotionally from the . are all they are , , of the storyteller as professionally and dispassionately as that claw hammer . As with most that rely on visceral impact to transport the viewer , the densely plotted story a wealth of plot that only rise to the surface of the viewer  s consciousness after the deliberately ambiguous ending . Oh Dae -  s become increasingly erratic as the tale and he comes closer to learning the truth . Given the that drive his character , his intense for the winsome Mi - do after just a few days don  t ring true even after we are given an explanation for it but , as they are crucial to the eventual outcome , leave the impression that they have been into the plot . Visually , the film is stunning , with superlative camera - work from - , and min - a towering performance as the anti - hero . - tae , in a smaller but no less important role , for much of the film the tragic persona his part out for . For my money , his character would have worked better had he been given a persona by the that have driven him to pursue such an elaborate act of revenge over so many . Despite these about character and plot , the film is definitely a addition to the growing number of imaginative and praiseworthy produced by over the last decade . I  a feeling that time may dull its reputation , that the talented - Park not yet the peak of his talent and will produce work in the future that will surpass . Certainly , the top 100 rating it on this is higher than it .",0
"First , I have to say that I never felt a movie hurt me before . It me in the face , me on the , me in the bowels .

I want to write about the system . a rare system for his movie that it run on itself . The for certain , the for drinking coffee , turning on the , split and all build up a skeleton for the film . The story then its space to fit in . It  s excellent work . It  s like Allan Poe  s masterpiece , Raven ... Mathematically perfect , calculated with absolute attention ,  s film is like a poem you can write in two . The perfectness of the piece your heart and mind bit by bit until the end of the movie .

"I Just saw Van Sant  s Last Days .

One of those that  s so good you want it to be over cause you want the experience to be complete . It  s one of those I knew half way through was going to be an important film . I kept thinking , this film everything . But it  t everything , it  s returned me to the original feeling I had , when I knew why i to make . Not to please anyone , but because somehow you could touch something unnameable , some deep seated longing , a communion with the human spirit perhaps . Let me just say that Sant made me realize I had been on the right track and just got lost for a while . There are a number of of film - making , and I had all but given up on making the kind of I really want to make because I  t think I had it in me . Then I see Sant do it , and I realize I was going somewhere real , I just lost heart . I know it  s been done before like this , where the sensation of the experience unfolding , but off the top of my head I can only think of a handful of times . Certainly Mon Amour . Malik it . Elephant had it , but not to this degree . of course . In Last Days , there  s a particular shot that it up for me . The couple in the bed asleep in the foreground . The on the bed stand , also on the foreground , been left on is something utterly random - two Karate a duel . As if by accident , we see through the in the garden below , stoned , digging into the earth ( digging his own grave ?). Life is going on all around and the camera seemingly haphazardly itself into that life , almost as if Van Sant is an anthropologist who to have brought his camera along to the unfolding last days of  s life . I had come off the . I to listen to that voice : it  s the plot ! It  s the machinery of the story that the audience along and the hour and a half , two of life they have into your story . Everything must move the plot forward ! Every scene a significance ! Well , it can be the plot . can mesmerize you for two . can pump your blood . But there  s something else . There is the tactile experience . The beautiful , apparently irrelevant . The camera for on the shot of tree foliage , a shot that Blake just as Don the house for him in an attempt to appease his wife  s hired PI . Blake making himself a bowl of cereal . The complete pitch from a bemused Yellow ad man as Blake off . Blake  s heartbreaking eternal dissolve into the floor after getting high . I  d forgotten why I to make .

"I know I said I would review this , and so I finally have . This movie was amazing . I went in thinking that it was going to be another Jet Li movie with a little bit of to be a vehicle for the massive fight . But instead , it turned out that this movie had a lot of heart . This is a story about ( Jet Li ), who been brought up from a very young age for the soul purpose of fighting . He does not know anything else . He only how to defend himself and use his body to kill . But what when a nice older gentleman Sam ( Morgan Freeman ) him find his own personality and ? That is the basic premise of the movie . I figured that Jet Li was simply a fighter , but as it turns out , he can actually act . We  t talking caliber performance here or anything , but he still me quite a bit . He can still fight , and fight well . The where he was fighting were that much more amazing by the fact that there  t a slew of them like in previous . I should have known that since Morgan Freeman was in it , that it  t just an action movie , but something with a personality and a purpose . He is truly the embodiment of the father figure in these days . Or perhaps maybe even the grandfather . He God ( Almighty ), the President ( Deep Impact ), and in his older age gone more to the grandfather role of a one eyed janitor ( MIllion Dollar Baby ), and now a blind piano teacher in Unleashed . He is an amazing actor and does not disappoint in this , or any of his . From time to time , the , or his character may be less than perfect , but his acting is always flawless . These are really the two main in this movie . Although Bob , ( Enemy at the , Super ) a sizable role as well as  s caretaker during his fighting days . He does a good job and you truly have something against him by the end of the movie . I so badly for something terrible to happen to his character . Which is what his character was written for as the villain . There is also a girl , who is Morgan Freeman  s character  s best friend  s daughter . Did you get that ? Yeah , i  m confused now too . She is by Kerry who I had never of before . To be an unknown , I was . She the little girl part quite well . But her character got on my after awhile . That could have been the acting , but I believe it was written that way . All in all , this movie was amazing . I really don  t have any negative of it because it me and took me by surprise as it was not what I was . If you enjoy martial with a good , I believe you will enjoy this movie . I would say that this movie 8 out of 10 . Go see it .",1

"I a lot about this movie from people that I know and through and , so when I finally sat down to watch it I  t know what to expect there were many on the level of controversy and content and my argument the level of shocking touched on is if you take out the faced then the movie does not hold the that it and therefore will not create the atmosphere of devastation and self destruction in the terrifying allure that is Cool , The movie does have strong of shocking subject matter but it is only shocking because it is the thought of thirteen year old being apart of this , the film in my opinion is probably the most impressive I have seen it touched me and I felt for ( Wood ) who is my actress , she the difficult task of trying to fit in with the popular crowd and to lose control she is completely convincing as a lovely young girl who so obliged to fit in she is willing to change who she is , Holly who her mother a single mum struggling a vital role as she to bring out of what she to be a circle of self destruction . This movie is very entertaining but also a very deep meaning and is a very effective film I feel that the content is one of a difficult nature that the director and cast tackle with an excellent and throughout . I would say this film is an outstanding movie that made me think a lot about the effects of peer pressure on young people in society and in conclusion to my review it is a movie that to be seen but will leave you thinking , those people who think this movie is bad well its opinion but I can advise you to watch this movie if you are interested in the effects of peer pressure , its brilliant its shocking and its the truth and its all happening so fast I love this movie because of the way it works on so many 10 / 10",1

This movie is nothing more than a pathetic attempt at the horror genre by someone who that these of can be considered successful by how much blood there are on someone  s shirt , or by the amount of each character . Rob Zombie is . Nothing more and nothing less . If you watch this movie being a pillow and a soft blanket , because I guarantee you will fall asleep after the first 20 .",0

It is great that there is a film that and , seriously as its primary Subject , the story from an point of view . This is the first film ( to my mind , that done this ). , as a concept , is most often seen as a massive , dirty , backwards  Heart of Darkness , unexplored unless by prying , news ( with snot running out of their .) The fault  t lie with the film ( it is quite firm about its contempt for the  West  s  strategic lack of agency ).

The list goes on . To list  , rant - style , here would be counter - intuitive , to my mind . Go find out . Hopefully there will be more about in the future .

Perhaps the had as much problem believing the as I did . For crying out loud , they even threw in a with cancer as a whorish attempt to generate some emotion , although it added nothing to the plot . The special effects were exceptional . If that is sufficient for you to enjoy a movie , this is a movie for you .

It was actually pretty cool when the guy on the new boat what Rose  s name is , she  Rose . Rose . That proved how much she him .

I had no idea where they were going to go with this film , and neither did they . The film is a confused mess with barely a plot thread stringing it together , certainly a hallmark low for hack writer . But that  s the charm of it , I guess . It  s so confused , and to show you all of cool stuff , that the movie itself been lost . It  s no more a clone of the original film than of any of the other in the Ring canon . But it IS entertaining , and charmingly bereft of a real plot . On the one hand , it  s disappointing - the concept of the original is rife with for a sequel - but on the other , it  s sort of grand in its utter inability to capitalize on anything .

One viewer spoke of the movie as if an intoxicating poem but whatever he read into it was purely coincidental as this movie did not divulge any such information as to why the couple broke up , for example , although we glimpse an argument where for a well - deserved comment hurled at Clem . One of the worst about it was the fact that the audience knew pathetically little about their apparently 2 year relationship or the that weaved their hearts together in the first place nor the their love fell through . And why on earth anyone would want to be soul with the impossibly , arrogant and offensive Clem is beyond all capacity for understanding .

It turns out that the number two heavyweight in the world needs a last minute replacement to fight for $ 250 . The fact that never been out him an attractive story line .

"Can  t understand why people like this dull movie . It boring predictable , pretty bad acting . Paper thin , if your bad then your do evil stuff all the time and if your good well u get the point . Even if u haven  t  t read the book u can figure out whats going to happen 10 min or so in to the movie . 3 long , nothing really going on except almost dying a few times but of course saved in the last minute . Sam his little annoying speech thats suppose to be or something . 3 ? they could  cut it to 2 and that would be more then enough . I dread the cut . Sure it its but come on people ! Is this movie really better than Pulp Fiction , The , Beauty ?.",0
"What a great film it is really extraordinary this is the most fascinated film i had ever seen , good luck brad and do more like this , you can do it , it is interesting that the life and the power of it stand in the heel . The subject is powerful by the which they meet in antiquity . I how they the in film especially brad , Eric , Bloom , and . I think they are the who can win the in the future because they are greatly talent and can to play in any does matter the role . Congratulation to the film group , the work that you do it is seen .",1
"the Dog ( US title : Unleashed ) good fighting in it as you  d expect from a Jet Li movie and it also some compelling acting from . Li . The only major gripe I have with it is the concept of human experiment which it as it  s premise ( Get them young and the are infinite ). Put a collar around an infant and raise him to behave like a dog ? Realistically speaking the movie no merit on this level and bluntly us to accept the fact that is a grown up  dog  with the mind of a child . The collar comes off and the  unleashed  dog becomes a martial killer machine . What  s more is that Bob as just  t strike me as the utter despicable human monster he is supposed to resemble . We are with cardboard  fairy tale  and when we look to the story we find just another rip off of . The story no dignity to it and is simply without merit , it  t even that scurrile that you  d be able to accept it for that alone ( like in  The , the Watch and the Very Big Fish ). The only  spice  that is added is the martial which us from the  transformation  plot and yet ( since we all love fairy tales with happy ) we still hope can make his transformation back into the child he was and become the man he is supposed to be . If I had to categorize this movie I would file it under Action , Drama , Fantasy . Why the latter ? Because once upon a time evil man woman , infant , infant is raised by evil  uncle  man in evil dungeon to become evil killer dog , sweet music back  womb  and   the human aspect inside the child dog man , love is sweet , love is good and former dog child evil uncle in the and quits and all live happily ever after . Jet Li good acting and superb martial action and if you can forgive all the other short then you will like it all the more . I can  t help to think that this movie could have done way better with a different director . cinema is dead anyhow , according to the . 6 / 10",1

"I just rented  The Life Aquatic  on last night . I had high for this movie . Bill is one of my favorite . I love his comic work ; Day is my favorite movie ever and  s performance is what that movie its magic . also been impressive in less comedic lately . Lost in Translation was a very well done and poignant film . Based on the , like an off - beat comedy - perfect for someone like , I thought . The rest of the cast is also impressive . and Cate are both very talented . Heck , I even don  t mind ; I think he  s kind of cute . With a cast like that , had so much potential to be great . What a disappointment it turned out to be . As I , the for gave the impression that it would be a comedy , albeit a little weird . This is very misleading . The film is not funny - it is not a comedy and it  t clear what exactly the film is supposed to be . Is it art house ? Drama ? Comedy ? All three ? I  t tell because does all these so poorly . It from one boring , unfunny scene to another . There is little sense of connection between the . The plot is nonexistent . Now I don  t mind minimal plot . Lost in Translation barely had a plot , but it was still a great movie because of the . In the are terrible . You do not get to know the and subsequently you just don  t care about them . A real shame , considering the talented cast . Bill none of his to his character - watching is about as interesting as watching paint dry . like he  s by this part - perhaps he already knew during that this movie would be such a stinker . Overall this movie is a great disappointment and a waste of time . I cannot believe it is getting such high from .",1
"I recently watched  Troy  for a second time and just what a mediocre snooze fest it is . I  t been all that with Troy after the first , and this movie does not hold up well with repeated . Like most period these days , Troy at least is a good looking picture . The , the , the , the , are all very nice to look at . Brad is nice to look at as well , but his character is as dull as a doorknob . One just does not care about what to . The other are similar . nothing to the role of - for the face that a thousand , she  s pretty lifeless . Bloom  s a little more personality than everyone else in the movie - but he  s such a loathsome coward that one is for him to die soon rather than truly interested in what will happen to him . The just on and on . Even when there are and , they are boring . I was disappointed that the supernatural of the original myth were not included in this movie . ticking off the , being dipped in the , and other the of would have spiced up the story a little bit . As it , the plot is dull and way too long . Part of the problem is that one is really not sure who to root for in the movie . It  t clear who the good and the bad are supposed to be . There is no hero in this movie , and there  t even an anti - hero . Perhaps a better screenwriter could have done a nice job of up the ambiguity between good and evil in Troy and made it interesting . Instead the lack of a protagonist and antagonist one care nothing about any of the and for a very painful 3 hour movie . When Troy is finally over , you don  t feel sad that , or happy that Troy burned , or any of that . You  re just glad that the movie is finally done .",0
"When I read the of who say this movie  does not wear well , I have to laugh at much of the trash made the last few . Much of what is made today  t even stand up against today  s low . The High and the Mighty actually a STORY and who have , , and . I was a young boy of about six when our family flew the first United - 7 flight from to San . I can remember what it was like to high above the Pacific for many with four massive radial roaring outside the cabin . This movie the realism of such a flight . This movie also back of how DRESSED UP to fly in those days . The sloppy appearance of today  s is in marked contrast to the class by of the . I even remember the Airport of the early and the look of the and can remember the fragrance of fresh flower as we through the airport . I remember how we out into the sunshine to board the plane by climbing to the cabin door . Yes , this movie is a different world . It  s as a U . S . Territory , as when I lived there . It  s a throwback to a time when were fresh from a World War . Men more like then , as they do in this movie , and ladies had a lot more class before our modern age made it acceptable for both to be so crass . The writing may seem archaic by modern but it fit perfectly the era in which it was made and us a wonderful glimpse of the beginning of the golden age of commercial aviation . This movie all of this brilliantly and a complex mix of living an ominous threat to their survival . I it as a boy and love it now . I bought the Special Edition just recently and love it immensely . It a lengthy series of and will surely please of and the rest of the cast and of this movie in particular . As an additional footnote , I want to add the following : In the late 1970  s , after I received my own private pilot  s license , and after reading one of K .  s other , I wrote a fan letter to . , with my about his love of flying . It was simply to him at San Island , . I was to receive a very nice personal reply from this talented writer of the book and screenplay ,  The High and the Mighty .

"All i can say is i have never been so sad for a movie to end in my life . By the time it was over all i could think was i wish there was more . This is certainly my favorite movie . I am 16 old .. and though I  m sure it was a older generation that went to see this movie , this film touched me in a way no other movie had done before . is absolute wonderful in this film .. and very handsome . If anyone ever his acting this film here that he is one of the best out there . All i can say is everyone .. young and old , should go see this movie . It was a true inspiration to me and i hope it is to you to . I really hope to go see this again .. and buy it whenever it comes out on video . Hopefully this review will come and handy and you will go see this movie . You wont regret spending your money on it ... it is simply the best movie that was ever made . :)",1

"I saw this movie with high . never seen any of  s but hearing wonderful about them , I thought that The Life Aquatic would be superb . For lack of a better term , I was disappointed . Perhaps it was because I was unfamiliar with  s style or because I simply  t in the mood . What  t I like too much ? First off , the humor . It was WAY too smug . Much of it  t really laugh - out - loud hilarious , or it was just really dull . Perhaps all of  s are like this , but I was for some great . To me , this movie was a better film about the relationship between and his son ( by ). Next , I  d have to say the . Some really long of time are kind of boring and lifeless . I know many people are going to disagree with me , but I was constantly my watch to see how much longer I  d have to sit through . Even though there were ( mind you , big ) of the film that were good . Let me start off by saying that the cast is perfect . , , , , , and all give wonderful . The cast is pretty much perfect . and Bill work together amazingly as father and son who see very much differently . The imagery in the film is also pretty wonderful . The look of the sea life is all very creative and cool , and I really the style of the art direction . The end of the film : wonderful . As the jaguar shark that his best friend , he a change of heart . by its beauty , he can  t bring himself to slay it as he had set out to do . This moment is amazing , and for some moody but hauntingly lovely music ( is the name , I recommend you it ). At that moment , the film actually kind of my . Then again , I hear that this film better with multiple . Perhaps someday I might watch it again and I might agree with who it .",1
"Wow . I was quite by this flick . I was something akin to  Kung Pow : Enter the Fist  or  Top Secret . The trailer a little silly , and I never it much attention . It came home on video though , and after watching it we all agreed that we were pleasant . The story unfolded much like some other , like  Hero  and  House of Flying Daggers . There was emotional struggle of lost love , and underdog . overwhelming force . The special effects were a bit over the top , but I feel they really did fit in well with the overall concept of the plot . Even through all the sadness and anxiety the plot provided , it all did finish up with a solid ending .",1
"Closer is trying to say something profound , but who what . It  s a case of style over substance - a  much ado about nothing . An anti - feminist movie , with two thoroughly unlikeable men , one silly woman ( ), and an , but naive (?) fourth ( Portman ). The are just chess - being by the men , and seem quite content to their status . No empowerment , insight or intelligence . Maybe this is real life , where just cannot help themselves , poor . Quite a tedious movie about a pointless subject , lots of talking about pointless and debating about pointless , meaningful , bed - , lying , deceit . There is very little character sympathy - as each character is completely indulgent and to exercise restraint or discipline . This mediocre picture is not by gratuitous to give the some vague : is a ( mediocre ) photographer , who to live by the rule that a crap picture is better if its enlarged , Portman is a stripper ( now that  s worth the rental fee !) and is a doctor of some sort . Most , Law is an obituary writer . Maybe he could write an obituary about his nearly dead career , been in turkey after turkey recently . On the plus side , it  s good to see in an  Adult  role , and she that she can excel in a good dramatic role . Portman  t too bad , and Law and Clive just go through the . Well , the male did , given the weakness in their .",0
"I had a movie session with my a while ago , and we happen to stumble upon this piece of movie . It was her choice , and I know that I  t picked it if I had to choose . :-) Anyhow , this movie out rather weird and it a lot of in the chronology , which was quite easy to follow for me ( even though I thought it was quite weird ) but my was facing a hard time at times trying to follow the in the chronology . Portman an excellent performance here ( as usual ) and really this movie . The by Law and Clive are , but I think that one of her less good here . The movie  t really turn out to be an awful movie as I first by it from its first 30 , and I have to admit that it settled a weird feeling in me that it was somehow , but I  t really like it at all . The piece a few for the analytic trying - to - predict freak , which were to my pleasure .

"It to be a common statement with some , that Equilibrium is just another one of those action that was strategically made to look and feel much like  The Matrix  ( both visually and in it  s overall ) but I disagree . Yes , while there may be some , I tend to think that Equilibrium as a film in it  s entirety is wholly different . If anything , the movie actually me more of a cross between  - 1138 & 451 ( obviously !) But what is absolutely excellent about this movie is  s introduction of the  Gun -  fighting style .

"I  d read only three positive before I saw this movie , and I still don  t understand why people it . , the language is quite explicit , and it may be shocking to hear it from we don  t expect to be foul - mouthed in ( I don  t think anyone would have about the profanity if Joe had been in the film ), but when you  re dealing with such as love , sex and being , and you really want to show their pain or , as in the case of Clive  s character , their determination to win the war , sometimes colorful language is necessary . A part from that , this movie is really heartbreaking , as director Mike ( an expert in odd relationship - ) and screenwriter , who also wrote the play this movie is based on , narrate a  war  between two , who are determined to obtain what they want , no matter what might be necessary .  s dialogue is gripping and believable , and it does actually provide some ( the highlight is the on line - sex between Law and Clive ), although the movie is actually a great tragedy . The script is also complex , as it from month to month and year to year and almost never the ( you have to listen to the in order to understand what ). As for the , Law and are very good , but they  re hugely by Portman , who is really impressive as a stripper who actually only to be , and Clive , quite simply OUTSTANDING as merciless dermatologist Larry . Not even his portrayal of ( from Sin City ) can match the energy , passion and rage ( or brutality ) he in this incredibly compelling film , strangely by some and by the Academy . This movie is one of the best of 2004 and also an excellent choice for those who don  t like big - budget , effects - heavy . Not if you believe in happy .",1

"F --- yeah ! Trey Parker and Stone sure did a good a job in this spoof of all the Jerry / Bay in this puppet movie that  s also a spoof of the cult classic marionette action series , and at the same time , it fun at all political sides , though Bush and Kerry were missing , crap ! But still , it is funny to see them make fun of all the in action and war on terrorism . In some ways , it does poke fun at itself especially poking fun at how other see , and make look the way see them ( I Alec , and ), and make other look the way some people see them . And not to mention Kim ! He was very funny with the   and   and his song about him being lonely .

"Two before the were , I this movie will be one of the for many . I haven  t watch it , but the title was telling me it will be the great pleasure watching it . I knew it  t one of the sweet love and  t wait to buy and see what can show me two of my - wonderful and amazing . Two later , I was disappointed ( even though I  t watch it ) seeing how there were no Golden for this movie , and it won only one . None of them for or . This summer I finally got the opportunity to see  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind . I  m a man , and men don  t cry , but this time I cried . I was amazed by  s and  s , the story was absolutely fantastic , and this movie my No1 . Yes , I know it  s a bit funny and odd being amazed by movie you  t watch , but it to me very often . And when I finally spend my precious time watching that , I become satisfied . This time , I was more satisfied then I thought I would be .  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  is the best movie ever !!! I know most of you won  t agree with me , but if you watch it one more time , you will see how strong and healthy it is . I  m not saying healthy only because the are good , I  m saying it because it could clear you mind and learn you not to make sudden .  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  is basically the story about human nature . Made in extremely strange and , I think , experimental way , it told us how we can control our mind , but our heart will survive the and come out as one big winner . Mary ( Dunst ) us it by re - falling in love with Doctor . It us and when they met again . was great . She us one more time that she is one of the best ever and I can  t understand why she  t win so far . She surely was better than Swank in  Million Dollar Baby . was the one who lead this movie . I watched her in  Titanic  and were amazed by her , but this role was very hard and definitely her best . In  Titanic  she was a lady , but here we could see her excellent , strange impulsive girl . was amazing , especially in of fight against from his memory . I also can  t understand why he  t win at least nomination . He  s probably the best example how Academy can make terrible . I was by his acting in  Man on the Moon , but this time he was even better . Dunst was also very good , but Wood was the one that me , pleasantly . Certainly the best technical part of this movie is camera . It was great . I  never seen such a great and . It was like taking a part in all that  s happening on the screen . Make - up was perfect . really good ; he was the perfect image of tired , , depressive shy guy .  s hair was such a tasty detail . Two before I  t imagine that colour , but when I saw it , I was with surprise how good it was . And a screenplay \u0096 wonderful . So many nice , so much subtlety , so many nice .

The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  is the master - piece of all time . The best movie ever seen , the best story ever written !!!",0
"I already saw this movie 10 times . The argument is so really close to the oppression we face on some , the lack of feeling humanity for itself , that it , we are not on the 21st century at all , but at the Time . We are there NOW . The being found , little by little , the self control , the fight , highly , and this BEFORE MAtrix ever ... The are very realistic , and the creation of a crowded city , is accomplished . Some , like the Cleric ,  feeling  the guide , is amazing , as one can find a emotion , just by touching bare metal . It is by all a super Movie . Here in , i only found about it some time ago , but i already ordered one copy .",1
"Wonderfully and intensely psychological , this is the type of film that is meant to be more than once . The film to be the most realistic depiction of adult that I have ever seen on the screen . There is no simple explanation for their and , the and the plot are both extremely complex . Closer  s presentation of realistic and highly me a lot of those in  s Streetcar Name Desire . If you are in the mood for a film that really you think and you something to reflect back on later then I would highly recommend this film to you .",1
"If you are looking for a film about love that  t include cheesy chat - up , heart - shaped chocolate and the guarantee that the will all live  happily ever after , then this is likely to be a film for you . For once , I have found a film that is not about love in a fairy - tale , but instead , is about true love that you find in the real world , with the bad and dull left in . In contrast though , this film never dull . For the entirety of my first , I was sat in the cinema , with my glued to the screen and welling - up throughout . I was by  s ( ) and  s ( ) acting , especially since I can not sit through most of  s because I generally find him so annoying ! In this film though , wonderfully as a man whose life a bit dull , until he in love with an exciting and interesting woman , who out his personality and him shine . in acting superbly , once again as a character who does not quite conform and to be different . and have in an extremely convincing relationship as well ; working even better together than they do alone . The heart - felt from the supporting can not be either . Dunst and add an essential ingredient to the film , with another , unexpected relationship that , at first to support the work that  s character ( ) does . works at  Lacuna  which is a company that of people  s so they can forget whatever they wish to . The of the procedure are beautifully by an extract from Pope  s poem  to  that a wonderful juxtaposition to that are gradually being erased of and when their relationship was happy , as the poem is read by Mary ( Dunst ) over the that so strongly suggest that to have your memory erased is to take away a part of your soul . At the end of the film Mary and relationship becomes proof that are what us who we are , and to forget a part of our is to forget a part of who we have become . As goes through the procedure for his memory he to remember why he felt so much for and his love for her and as they meet by - incidence in after they have both had the procedure they can start to rebuild their relationship as if it were the first time that they have met . What I find most wonderful about  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  though , is that after they discover that they have had the procedure to erase each other from their and why they to forget each other , they agree to give it another go because it is worth it , purely to remember the good times , even if the outcome is the same as last time . Overall , the entire film really up what a true relationship is about and is beautiful to watch , not only because of the superb script by , but also because of the wonderfully mise - en - scene , cinematography , and music . Consequently , I give this film a very big up ! Watch it , you won  t regret it !",0
"A . Wellman  s The High & The Mighty ( 1954 ) might very well be the  Grand Hotel  of the wild blue yonder .

Top billed is legendary hero , as - pilot Dan . is living with of a fiery plane crash just beneath the surface . The pilot , ( Stack ) is a stoic , and neurotic mess who eventually a complete melt down \u0096 forcing to rise to the occasion , take over and land the plane safely . Ah , but will he ? The rest of the cast like a who  s who of forgotten or nearly forgotten character , , Day , and . Despite being one of the most sought after by , the film is really little more than a sensationalist precursor to the highly popular 70s disaster series , Airport . The one curiosity of this disc is that it is a Warner film by Paramount . Apparently a issue the copyright to lapse in the latter  s favor . as meticulously , the transfer on this disc is something of a disappointment to the expectation of pristine image quality . Although the out relatively strong , with a very bright and strongly print element , it quickly into various of quality \u0096 the worst being near the end of the film when the plane its emergency landing in . In those final , the image is overly soft , some minor edge enhancement and even a touch of color bleeding . Throughout , flesh are not very accurate at all ( an inherent flaw of all Warner - Color film stock of the period ); they  re either excessively pink or a flat orange . Most of the color spectrum to mute along a greenish gray , hazy brown balance . At times contrast can seem a tad pasty . are rarely deep or solid . Whites are bluish or yellowish but never a true white . between exhibit the inherent flaw of all early , with momentary blooming of excessive film grain . Yes , to the way this film on television this disc is a resounding improvement . But it does not come anywhere near to the level of quality one would expect from a disc as  and . The audio is a 5 . 1 attempt at the original six track stereo , but it  s generally strident and not very natural sounding at all . are too numerous to go into any great detail . There  s an of and newly , a bunch of vintage material , gallery and theatrical ; comprehensive to say the very least .",1
"This movie is not bad . It a strong cast with Bill and in their best , a good director , but timing . Bill is an actor who comes to Japan to do a whiskey commercial . He lonely and up meeting , by who just like him . They develop a deep friendship that  change their in many ways . Some might get , like me , as the film very slowly . It  s an average story about relationship and loneliness . No reason to call it the best film ever about loneliness . see a truly film about that , see High Noon , that is loneliness !",1
"I don  t have much to say about this movie except that I did not enjoy it , thus I do not recommend this movie at all ! Its first problem was that it had next to no plot and was very hard to follow . Secondly the entire movie to be a lot of ( random ) shooting and violence . The acting is mediocre . A lot of it around ; he is just out to be the  hero  and have good . In general , I  t find the acting particularly inspiring or even entertaining . Do not be by the seemingly exciting summary on the back of the because I assure you there is not much of a story ! Unfortunately , not even the  special effects  me this time !",1
"Lemony Snicket  s A Series of Unfortunate  - a creepy , cringe - hunk of pseudo - - , once and for all , that they just don  t make good old - fashioned the way they used to . Technically speaking , the film  t actually set in the Era but rather in a never - never land in which 19th century clash with late 20th Century technology . And , indeed , it is the unique look of the film - through extraordinary art direction and brilliant production and costume design - that is the one element of quality in the movie . The plot is vintage Dickens : three adorable and resourceful , Violet , and Sunny , find themselves unexpectedly homeless and when a mysterious fire their and their house . With no last will and testament who is to raise them , the are off to a distant  relative  by the name of . , a creepy , sadistic eccentric who in a ramshackle mansion across town and with a seething passion . He also host to a troupe of ghoulish ( ostensibly fellow ) who look like punk rock from the dance down in Soho . In no time flat , . turned the three into his own personal . He even goes so far as to try to rub them out on the notion that he will then inherit their  money . The plot the repeatedly from  s diabolical into the protective arms of other  , only to have him show up in various , knock off the competition , and re - establish his primacy over the hapless trio . Although ostensibly a comedy ,  Lemony Snicket  s  is , in actuality , an extremely dark , depressing movie , definitely not appropriate for young , but even will be made uncomfortable by its obsessive emphasis on cynicism , sadism and death . The movie its nadir in a truly queasy scene in which the middle - aged to marry his 14 year - old ward as a of the money . This is supposed to be funny ? Beyond that , the movie is boring and episodic , with little narrative thrust to hold the disparate and repetitive   ( we  agree that they are quite  unfortunate ) together . Normally a big fan of , I found his performance in this film to be repulsive and unwatchable , a new career low for him ( well , his Grinch comes pretty close ). Even the normally can - do - no - wrong Streep victim to this film . One can only imagine what a master artist like Dickens would have done with this material , how he would have it with wit and heart and a strong statement about human and societal .  Lemony  could have been an imaginative , delightful story about a crazy but engaging old codger who magic and fun into the of three hurting . Instead , it  s a dismal tale of a twisted old psychopath who two killing innocent people and with the same fate if they don  t do everything he them to . I honestly can  t imagine what audience these movie thought they were appealing to with this movie . If this film , heaven help us , ever a rash of , we  have to change the title to  Lemony Snicket  s A Series of Unfortunate .",0
"I must say , I was reluctant to view this film . I have been a big fan of  s work , but ... not so much . All right , I hate his , but not . To me he  s a revelation in this movie . Sensitive , complex , emotive and a true match to  s considerable talent . This film is basically a romance , but with an intellectual twist so rare in this era of throw - away . This film to suppose that some  t and  t be so easily . The idea is wonderful , the script intelligent and romantic ( with a nice little subplot the ) and the execution picture perfect . I urge anyone out there like me who been purposely  s work to try this one . It  s so good , you can almost forget Ace ... almost .",1
"After watching this movie , you come to think about how important and valuable your freedom really is . I think everyone should watch this movie .

On the not so good series , I  d point the captain of the , who to have some good at some of the movie , and who ended killing the young guy in such a pitiful and disappointing way . Also the director of without getting what he should have receive for being such a bastard , which was quite unfair . But well , the worst punishment you could get , is not physical , nor material , it  s when you discover you ruined your life , and lost your time . I gave this movie a 9 , because nobody and nothing is perfect . I can guarantee that you won  t regret watching this , even if it away 2 of your free time , this movie could make you realize how to spend the of your life in the most clever way .

Here is a movie about a bunch of that lack the ability to have a healthy relationship and seem perfectly happy to play partner swap between themselves . .... how could a story so perfect for late night on cine - be so royally ruined ? Bad script , bad and bad acting . First warning any movie patron should note is that rarely translate into good . Face it , are filled with pompous preachy that stage actor seem to love and some people seem willing to watch . But I want a movie where the from the character have meaning and seem real , here they are too often over extended that push the realm of reality . In most any scene you start to wonder why one of the  t just walk away . You get the feeling they all just want to yammer on and on for the sake of hearing themselves whine and moan . : I  m sorry but if you want to jump around in time , give me a clue that you are going forward three or back one year or whatever . Don  t make me listen so closely to what they are saying to figure it out . I don  t have a copy of the playbill from the original play so I don  t have the advantage of a written guide to what scene I  m watching . Acting : , I can accept Clive acting ... Even was acceptable .... BUT , Law to be do the same character he did in the last two he was in , only now he talk on and on about nothing . And lest I forget Portman , GOOD GOD was this a mistake . Yeah she believable for a while but when you get to the part of the movie where she goes back to being a stripper .... I  m sorry but if you want to play a stripper and be believable take your clothes off . I could only laugh as she is up their as a strip among other that are actually bare breasted and she is wearing more than you would see on a beach . If you take a job acting as a stripper get naked , otherwise you come across as a joke . You start thinking ,  Oh , she to get away from being the nice queen of Star ... did she read that script the first time ? guess not and so you no longer believe her portrayal ... I could rant on but suffice it to say the movie ... maybe it was a good play , but as a movie it  t even worth the time on cable .",1

"Downfall ( , ( 2004 )) War can be the most emotive genre in cinema , but even in the company of other such as Platoon , Bridge over the River and Apocalypse now , German movie  Downfall  more than its own , and is simply one of the best yet . It the final days of rein before and after his suicide in Berlin , covering the of all those around them . The genius from the acting whereby they more than convince you that you are actually watching , in the flesh , and additionally the story  t simply the but afresh and them human . is shown as , paranoid and threatening , and unsettling as it may seem at you almost for him , but overall you see his ego and lack of sympathy for his fellow German . The other chart a cross section of Berlin society , and they conjure up the fear , delusion and suffering in the face of inevitable defeat , realistically staging the pain that must have the country at that time . The film being made in German itself ( and by ) a personal touch I guess to the movie , and a new dimension to war . For too long , WW2 been too much like as if it were all Star , when the truth is actually much more complicated . This film hopefully to redress the balance a little bit . If you have a chance , I  d strongly recommend it . the regime by just showing them as they were , but also the suffering many themselves went through which been pitifully over the . A genuine , touching classic story which sadly in light of the rise of recent terrorism that the that have to be learnt are as relevant today as they ever were .  Never again ! 9 / 10",0
"The film was as  Blair Witch . The only I can find are that it very low budget and there is a shark in it . The tag line should have been  Two bad . Lots of water . No . Don  t get me wrong , I am all for that make you think , make you wonder and try to put the audience in the situation - was an excellent example - but this film does not have enough going on to keep you interested , there simply  t enough to think about and the acting is so diabolical I actually ended up wanting them to be eaten by just to put me out of my misery . If you have read this far and are still on watching this DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER ( unless you want to know the ending in advance ) This film I understand is BASED on a true story - but how ? They both ! How can anyone possibly know for sure what after they got left behind ? How do we know they  t end up going crazy from all the sea water they and ended up each other ? , I admit that is a bit extreme but there is no way anyone could know what really out there !",1
"Extremely complex and not very accessible adventure that ever since its premiere in 1968 been the study of film and alike . Even if you have seen the movie several times it remains one of the most fascinating and fresh of all time , and you can always find new , that you did not see the first time around . I really don  t consider it a real movie as such ; it  s a genuine narrative and the story get  s lost in the overall message of man and machine in space and so on and so forth . But it  s a voyage in a sort of conciseness that the story ( and the genre !) and in that of ever in a - movie . A unique film , no doubt one of the most important ever made .",0
"I watched this movie after hearing my brother say that it was one of his favorite of all time . I usually agree with him on stuff like this , so I went in with high . Unfortunately , I was very disappointed ... The movie is set in a utopian society reminiscent of stuff like Brave New World , 1984 , and 451 where human emotion is and any which invoke feeling are too be , and it the predictable tale of one of the , the people who enforce those , as he to feel and such . Now story was never meant to be the main draw of the movie , so I can forgive this . The real main draw is supposed to be the fight , a mix of martial and gunplay . However , just as the emotionless society sought to find the optimize their fighting style to find the single most efficient technique , so have the the fighting style to find the single looking technique , namely the hero surrounded by a dozen or so and proceeding to kill all of them without breaking a sweat . Yes , it pretty cool the first time he did it , but this same scenario is out at least 5 or 6 times with hardly any variation . The really only good in the film are a couple of emotional where the Cleric is caught in a tough situation that his have gotten him into or the final climax fight , which is the only truly original fight . Instead of the normal situation , we only have two each with one pistol . I can honestly say I  never seen a fight scene like that . Other than that , its just a mediocre compilation of from The Matrix , Brave New World , 1984 , .",0

However , what the film in originality , it it up with . There were a lot of funny and the movie hardly ever got boring . However , most of the funny were used in the trailer and this the a little less effective since they are already . Also , the repeat value of the movie is very low . It  s worth watching once but that  s pretty much it . I don  t think that  s a bad thing since most light are like that . I think the film works well because of the two . Both Mac and give funny and they have nice chemistry together . Their were the best and they never felt forced . also a good performance and she come a long way from in Crossroads . Most of the supporting are also funny , who Mac  s wife . Mike also a cameo though it  t that good . Rodney and he only does an job . The first half of the film is pretty funny and the racial are handled lightly . During the second half , the film becomes all serious and it  s kind of awkward . The director the for awhile and he the issue in a mature manner . It kind of works but some of the serious felt fake . It like the were about to burst out laughing at any second and the film also got kind of dull . The ending was surprisingly strong though . The of tone in the film worked out but they  t as effective as they could have been . In the end , Guess Who is worth a rental , nothing more though . Rating 7 / 10",1

"so strained my credulity that I feared it would snap and give me whiplash . The strain with the name of the hero : Dirk . Now there  s a manly name . I found myself coming up with even more outrageous , ala  Mystery Science Theater . How about  Rock ?  Harry ?  Punch ?  Buck ?  Dick  was already taken . The plot is basically part  s  The Mummy , mixed with a touch of and a pinch of Bond . Dirk and his Al ( why not a better name , like  Buzz  or  Fuzzy ?) are on a quest to find a lost Confederate ironclad battleship , which to make its way across the Atlantic and up an river , only to be buried in the treacherous of the . Never mind that you don  t have to be a ship designer to know that such a vessel would have less chance of making it across the Atlantic than a rubber . Never mind that this fact is pointed out to Dirk more than once by other . You  re just supposed to go with it . Such need to have a sense of giddy fun about them , like  s  Mummy . Much of the fun is stripped out with a parallel quest as a World Health Organization doctor trying to track down the source of a contagion that  s spreading from the country of Mali and into . I don  t know about you , but the story of two treasure - hunting frat with that of a doctor trying to stop the spread of a contagion that the of of people kind of some of the fun away for me . There  s also a so mean that he , well ,  put the  war  back in  . ( I wonder where the war went ?) He  s hell bent on covering up the contagion , taking from a big corporation that  s his country as a toxic waste dump ( the source of the contagion , which is conveniently near the buried battleship ), and fighting a group of ragtag . Oh , and this contagion , if it the ocean , will cause a environmental disaster . With me so far ? Dirk and Al cheerfully wisecrack their way across Mali as they blow up their boss  s speedboat , bounce along on , dodge , save the doc , and wreak havoc at a high - tech installation that would be right at home in a Bond flick . drop in their like manna from heaven . My favorite is a cave painting that them everything they need to know . With like these , the Three could find this battleship .

"One will be amazed at the historical accuracy of this masterpiece . Anyone who is a buff would agree it would be hard to find anything that would be considered off track . The acting was phenomenal . The world was very lucky to have alive for so many the world to hear the story of the last weird days of the 3rd . At no time did this viewer move from the screen . The director all of the horror related to the attack on Berlin . This film is highly to anyone to any interest in the last historical days of during world war .

The  home movie shaky - camera  style cinematography was dead - on . It certainly the roller coaster ride that is a teenage girl  s life well . I would most definitely recommend this movie for of a daughter who is around the age of 13 and that they watch it with their daughter otherwise she may not  get it , and if she were to watch it by herself , it may have a negative impact . Making sure that watch it with their daughter ( s ) is key so as not to mask the writer  s intention thereby blowing it off as an excuse for the teen to  swear , grope , ..

Regardless of whether or not you have , I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 18 ( the film is Rated - R ) who simply to see a compelling story about the and that face in , and with the amazing acting of , Holly , and Even Wood & Reed , it  s to shock , entertain , and educate .",0

His acting is not particularly bad , it is just awfully boringly obvious . No depth , no complexity , no ambiguity .

"I saw this movie at a Q & A ( with the director ) screening night in Center . I would say it was good movie but not a great one . It to me that the film was trying to do and be too many , so the emotional impact it had on me was far less than what I think it should have been , given the basic story and quality of the . I never read the book , so I can  t compare the film to it . I think my major were these : 1 . The way the story is told never me to really feel the level of love that was supposed to exist between   ( Ralph ) and   ( ), and it was this love that was supposed to enable   to change and choose the course of action that is the center of the story - the protagonist  s  quest . 2 . While the of the the and ( I believe that a later scene was shot in ) live under made me feel sympathy ( and to some degree , guilt ), there  t one main character who was a native of this environment - they were nameless who were supposed to symbolize the of the exploitation and corruption that victimize and her people . ( I don  t think the doctor who   worked with was native to that area .) So , while I felt bad in the same way I would if I were watching the nightly news , it  s not the same level of connection I would feel if there had been some well - defined - even one - who could have defined  who , as opposed to  what    was fighting for . Because the movie a mystery element to it ,   s  full , by virtue of both the narrative form and needs , a degree of mystery , and to me , this made her character seem somewhat aloof , and one - note , although I have no problem with  s portrayal of her . She is quite an engaging actress ; me a lot of . The most successful part of the film to me , despite the I , was Ralph  s beautiful performance . His work here is very internal , subtle and , and I found it quietly moving and powerful . Although  the too much going on  I to a competition of among the for what the focus of the film should be - a murder mystery ? A love story ? An exploration and indictment of government and corporate greed being able to flourish unnoticed in because nobody ? The director  s formidable skill in , and sound to create of , mystery , and suspense ?- it is  s moving portrayal of an gentleman who his quietly as he together what that from all of these vying as the center of this film .",0

"South Park Trey Parker and Stone return to the big screen with Team : World Police in an over the top and hilarious satire on world and the raging over the war on terror . Parker and Stone to poke fun at almost everyone , the U .

The film also the sense of optimism and black and white of foreign policy when Team the  everything is bon  after . For Team , the end the , and their job is to blow stuff up , police the world and catch . The two would later comment that they designed all the international to reflect what an might think a place like would look like , which meant a kind of World version of the world . The set for example had The Tower , the and the Arch De Triumph in one small square . The cobblestone are made of shaped and are relative to their distance from , showing the inward looking self - centered attitude . Parker and Stone  s politics have long been apparent in their work on South Park , spawning the term , South Park Conservatism . This new political movement is largely driven by young people who  t wearing Che T - and the war in every time there is a meeting of world . It can be loosely as an opposition for political correctness , use of satire to mock established and dearly both on the left and the right , and the of  . The purpose is usually to ridicule , mock and satirize the and dysfunction of that are often taboo to criticize .

The fact that for the entire scene ,  t a caricature but sympathetically as a real UN bureaucrat urging Kim to let him so his job so he could  ease the UN  s collective  the scene even more potent in its political analysis of the UN  s current . The achievement of the film is that in its nearly two of political satire , and especially with the speech , and pariah with the human reproductive anatomy , the South Park have a clear framework for their take on the world with amazing clarity and insight , the various talking , and who have done essentially nothing but scream at each other over the past few . The other part of the Team on Parker and Stone  s satire of Bay  s action and their total loathing of ( they later that they to hire real to do the voice work because they hate all which they feel are too self - absorbed in their own importance ). There  s several amazingly sung and composed of genre in the film , the testosterone driven  , F *** YEAH ! , country tune  Freedom  t Free  and Broadway musical  Everyone  among other one Bay and Ben  s ( largely deserved ).

"Kung - Fu Hustle , where to begin . Well , for , actor and director Chow is quickly becoming one of  s most beloved screen . At 42 , and already a veteran of numerous , Chow finally broke through to with  Soccer  in 2001 . Now he forth this comedic vehicle ,  Kung - Fu Hustle . This movie it all : slapstick comedy ( that  s right out of a  Looney  short ), martial , and spin - and arm - that are all courtesy of Wo Ping ( The Matrix ,  Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon ). In this picture , which is set in 1940s Shanghai , China before the revolution , Chow as Sing , an aspiring gangster who to join the notoriously lethal  Axe Gang . The Axe Gang much of the city  s underground with an iron fist and their are absolute . But the accident - prone Sing and his chubby companion ( by Chi Lam ) wander into Pig Sty Alley , posing as Axe Gang . The Axe Gang  t bother with this slum very much because it  s so poor and plus , it  s already under the tyranny of the vicious chain - smoking Landlady ( ), who along with her husband Landlord ( Wah ). become complicated when the real Axe Gang up , and the Gang is by a trio of kung - fu who had been living there . The Axe Gang are quickly in the chaos while Sing and his companion are by the . The two are to join , but are a deed of loyalty - kill someone . For the next 45 or so , Chow is off the screen , and we focus mostly on the of Pig Sty Alley , as the kung - fu square off in with Axe Gang , who are themselves . Landlady and Landlord are also later revealed to be too . Chow the picture and remains on the screen until the , where he , a white outfit a la Lee himself , on the in a free - for - all reminiscent of the  Crazy 88  s  scene from  Kill Bill . As it turns out , he is a kung - fu genius , in that he  s had the power to master martial since birth ( I must say Chow does display some impressive of his own ). He then does battle , in the film  s most over - the - top sequence , with The Beast ( Liang ), who is the most feared kung - fu master of them all . This is a brilliant action - comedy from a mind that to bring forth something like this to the . The film out a lot like a collision between every great martial movie we  ever seen and then a heavy dose of slapstick and Chow  s sly wit . You  laugh at Chow  s comedic , as every great kung - fu flick its fair share of comedy . It  s just kind of funny , since I was watching  Enter the Dragon  ( 1973 ) last night , which is considered the martial movie ever , and then today I watch  Kung - Fu Hustle , which could be one of the of the genre . Though some of the humor might be lost on , I found myself laughing quite a bit . It definitely caught on to me as Chow also sly homage to his , both Lee and , who made the Chow respect to . It  s all done in a deliriously comic fashion that also as a visual feast for the . The film also a rather touching subplot with a mute girl Sing once saved from , and it really got to me because of the cheesy music that up whenever they are on the screen together . Kung - Fu Hustle  is one of the best I  seen this year so far . I expect we  see a lot more of these of that are going to be by a devoted following in the future . Chow a funny , brash , and action - picture that  s sure to remain with the in the coming . 10 / 10",1
"When the world is by global terrorism and the of a homicidal madman who can  t pronounce his , the United on an elite team to save the day , who stand tall even if that only two high and suspended with puppet . Team : World Police  the threat of al - and global about the U . S . order and poke acerbic , crude fun at the whole thing , with and reducing everything to one - third life size . Director Trey Parker and his writing partner Stone prove that even 9 / 11 won  t get in the way of a good gay or poop joke . It  s one way to strike a blow for freedom , though not a guarantee of great comedy , even for the  South Park  gang . I admit I watched  South Park : Bigger , Longer , And Uncut  six ago with the hope I  t like it . The series was a guilty pleasure , but the review in Entertainment Weekly made the movie sound like the satire ever , something I found irksome . To my short - sighted disappointment , the film was great , one of those rare that made you laugh from beginning to end , yet gave you to chew on about censorship and obscenity , not to mention some super . I was disappointed seeing  Team , too , for a completely different reason . This time I was for Parker and Stone , especially after they took early heat from the Left despite the fact they clearly made fun of the neo - , too . Alas , this time it WAS a disappointment . The here are funny , if not as melodically solid as with  South Park  \u0096  Up There  would be a killer number in any musical . The humor out strong but after ten , giving you here and there but a lot of dead air , too . Alec , though that also up the weakness in Parker and Stone  s voice work everyone else . Worst of all , I never got the sense there was any underlying point to this film , to all the vulgarity and crudity being onto my lap , other than Parker and Stone wanting to show they had the to do it . Even the have . When we first meet , the main character , he is in the Broadway musical  Lease  with a finale :  Everyone . That anti - humor at its best [ My grandma and my dog Blue / The Pope got it and so do you / C  mon everybody we got  to do ] but not exactly ; the red ribbon that up off the stage like a ball like a  90s throwback because it is , just like the Jerry that the film throughout . When the material is more currant , it  s scarcely better . I admire any movie made in 2004 that fun of , but the can  t manage to do anything more with him than blow him up , which not only the point of  s cultural relevance but him more heroic than anything else , someone willing to die for his rather than make money off them . Similarly , the assorted killing of left - leaning movie ( as well as people like and L . , who  t especially political but apparently fun to kill in the Parker / Stone ) zero satirical value and just down the story . The anti - in  Bigger , Longer And Uncut  was a source of strength . Here , it . Kim - talk like a impersonation from the 1950s works for a minute , but it  t go anywhere , and his  I  m So  number from beginning to end . That said , the film does make you laugh , and the puppet production work is ingenious enough to make the film worth seeing for that alone . But given the heavy it with , and the comedic talent involved , I had for something more than a middling , infantile comedy that and scatological sex as cutting - edge comedy .",1
"When I loaded the page for The Ring Two , the comment at the time stated that it everything that made the first adaptation good . I agree with this sentiment . What it is that , the director of , was brought in to direct this mess . The presence of one name in the , however , me to believe that the overall mess to do with the screenplay . You it , , the man who first came into prominence with Scream 3 , wrote The Ring Two . , he also wrote the first adaptation of the , but director Gore was able to wrestle a decent final product out of his raw material . It that thought he was up to the task of wrestling a decent end product out of  s writing . He proved himself quite wrong . The do the best they can , and does a lot less sleepwalking in this episode , but I believe this film can be with killing off any chance of further . Of course , the acting is good enough to pass muster , as was the case in the previous Ring . is a surprisingly competent actor , given that her include a stint on the I like to call Please Go Away . Once again , she goes through the standard of a Scream Queen with championship pride . All the are present and for , but she them off like she is right at home in her environment . Then again , when one worked for Lynch , I suppose even creepy such as the of Samara from the set seem routine . However , when you get right down to it , is the only real star in the film . Much was made of Sissy  s role in the film , but it turned out to be one of the most walk - ons in the history of the genre . It was not until I the for the film that I was even aware of her appearance in the film . , as previously , been given less of a zombie - like appearance in this film , but in so doing , his character also becomes a lot less interesting . The visual effects of the previous Ring were mainly limited to one instance of a girl crawling out of the television set , combined with some practical effects or trick . In this sequel , there are endless of water flowing in unnatural , people being in and out of , or people . The plot like a blur , and I was only able to catch to some lost relative of Samara  s or how she is able to torment the family in spite of all the being met in the first film for her to leave them be . In short , I was given little reason to care about the that the central go through this time . Without a decent character to our upon , the film  s sense of horror or terror literally apart . It does not help that we have no idea what the framework of regarding what Samara can or cannot do is meant to be . As I said , a previous commentator stated that The Ring Two everything that made The Ring good . Suspense ? It is on the cutting room floor . Terror ? The framework for it was never there to begin with . Horror ? It the director would not know it if they were formally . New lead Baker his best , but Martin , his equivalent in the first film , was able to make us care about his character . Partly because the screenplay to be coherent , but also because he is able to act the part without to . Baker is swimming uphill against a director who does not seem to care about building a structured plot , and a screenplay that him speaking so unnaturally it is a wonder he did not cough up a boot during his with . No matter how I try , I cannot think up a simple cause and effect pattern to the in the film . It is literally a collage of that are meant to be , but have no framework on which to . It is for this reason that I am giving The Ring Two a two out of ten . It is bad . Not bad enough to be good , but not good enough to be entertaining , either . It literally up in no man  s land . See it if you can get it for free , but if there is something better on , such as a collection of You Can  t Do That On Television , watch that instead .",1

You do not need to actually think much , but just sit there and be blown away by the , laugh your butt off at the physical comedy , admire the jaw - dropping fight , and also get teary - eyed at the sentimental . Kung Fu Hustle is 95 of fast - paced in - your - face action that leaves you with a smile on your face throughout the entire film .

Throughout the film you see the main character try whatever to join the gang , and you will see the gang go to extraordinary to teach the landlady and the landlady  s husband a lesson . What this movie so great is that the movie good old - school kung fu action with excellent visual and special effects , and also a few action and chase that look like they were off of old Warner . The plot is very simple and easy to follow , but it will be all the chaos that will lure you into the film . Fighting . More fighting . Countless fighting . It is all there . Whether it is one man against an entire gang , a few against blind a deadly musical instrument , an insane man against a powerful couple , a very loud lady against her husband , or an old - fashioned brawl amongst the just for the sake of fighting , Kung Fu Hustle will deliver so much action , it the action - Kill Bill ( 1 AND 2 ). And then there are the Looney - style . The shine during these , especially the chase between the landlady and the main character ( Sing , by the director / writer of the film , Chow ). Mostly the action is for humorous , but at other times the style of fighting also serious , at one point it even Z , the infamous anime that a plot to incredible ( 20 + it took just to show one fight ). With most good all - around , you also get your sentimental as well . With this film , there is this sad scene with Sing and his bitter past and how it up his personality . There are other but I  d rather not spoil them for you . The acting is not the world  s , but like most action - , it is not necessary as long as there is enough going on to keep you on your . There is a lot of slapstick and physical humor that up for the lack of dialogue ; so if you are the kind that does not laugh at a typical businessman beating down two - be or a guy throwing a knife at a woman , only to have it bounce back and stab him , then you are not going to find this movie as funny as other people would . Bottom Line : One of the best in a very long time . Very well directed , plenty of effort was put into this , and it off . Plenty of action , comedy , and also with a dab of good music and drama the bill as the 95 watching this is much better than just watching the typical two - hour movie . I had a lot of fun watching this , me of the old days when I would watch that have no plot whatsoever but did not matter because they were just fun to watch over and over again . Surely this film will not get the box office success that it , because it is too goofy for people , and some ( and ) will fear that their ego will be if they are caught watching this . Come on everyone , watch this foreign masterpiece and do the hustle ! Score : 10 / 10",1
"s film is better after watching it for a second time . I love this film . Its absolutely perfect . A 170 minute film that kept me interested throughout the whole thing . Its a great about and the he while making great in aviation and making a few as well .  s direction is brilliant , i love the mood and feel of this film . Great job again by my favorite director . The screenplay is very interesting , at times very funny and great drama , ( of Last Samurai , Gladiator fame ) does a good job here . The cast is also good , one of his best , he is better than of New York which i previously to be his best performance along with What  s eating gilbert grape . Cate as the leading lady , great to see her working with . The supporting cast is great as well , was believable and good as ava a few up from her poor acting in pearl harbor . was also good in this film . C . , Alan and Holm all gave great supporting as well . The film a great score by Shore , and great cinematography by a very talented ( out the dead , u - turn , casino ), this guy some of my favorite , great cinematography in aviator as well . There was nothing i  t like about this film , I mean i usually am critical of , but i don  t see why people bash his later , his past 3 are all personal of mine and although they don  t rank as high as Taxi Driver , Casino , and in my favorite film list , they are still up there . Anyhow , 10 / 10 for Aviator , # 45 on my list of all time favorite",0
"I this movie , because , unlike most horror , it does not emphasize on gore . One does not see perhaps any act of killing by the , while it  s in progress . Instead the sound effect does that job in this movie . Also , the movie back and forth , and leaves unspoken and unexplained , which is a good thing to me ! This movie basically the scare on the face of , and in the heart , of the , which successfully the viewer . However , the standard of acting by the principal character is , at best , of star / movie quality . Actually , I spent the first half an hour ( after her appearance ) thinking in which adult movie had I seen her ! Then I that it was the movie  Nymph Fever , where a  scientist  with apparently , at least , 36DDD pair of silicone , , and almost exactly like our leading lady here . Sadly , our heroine neither to have 36DDD , nor any trace of acting . Also the movie is heavy with major logical . For example , no human being would return alone to a house ( in spite of being fully aware that the house is ) at night for whatever reason ; but this movie such a scene in it . That is absolutely absurd , and all logic !!",1
"An intelligent and difficult film  Closer  , and the audience whether to investigate what is . There are no easy and none are . My guess is that most people would rather dismiss the film than dwell on the very uncomfortable ; after all reflection is very hard work and we are mostly not used to it . Will total honesty always destroy sexual jealousy always destroy us acting on our impulsive ; is it our  moral rectitude  or our fear of the can we live a compromise and still be true to would a win - win compromise look like in the context of a we have lied can we still trust that someone else is telling us the we stuck in a relationship because our fear of the unknown is greater than our present great is our need for control in a relationship or do we need another to control that it was the men who to know every detail of the so -  truth . Maybe it is the case that can live with a deal more uncertainty and compromise than men . It did seem that the two were more fragile and maybe this is generally the .. Lots to think on and I am glad that I saw this film .",1
"is , like Drive , Blue Velvet and before , a personal movie . Kelly provided his with a canvas open to their own interpretation . My personal interpretation along the of as the , the balance between the Tangent . The first part of the film fighting against the of the world he him . His struggle itself in his neurosis and of Frank . In this part of the movie Sparrow  s declaration that we all die alone is negative to . However as become clearer to him ( and more to us ) he that he to die alone , he to die to save and put back the way they should be . The final part of the film on acceptance of this . Frank must die in order to free who in turn .  Our  after  s death and home to sacrifice himself to rectify the traumatic . The ending the question to us that can one death to save be ? The personal nature of the movie many question and an equal number of . in its analysis are impossible to avoid but that is the best part of this cult classic .",1
"What can I say , I  m to find this film so highly on . So where does it all go wrong . , lack of soul . I felt no emotional connection with any of the in this film . and under directed to be the best way to describe it . The only character who was vaguely well and any sort of emotional connection was Eric as Hector . as was so wooden I was that Bloom did not get each time they . Secondly , some of the worst dialogue to film since Wood made , but at least he put his heart into what he was doing . This film featured some great , Bard and Cox to name two , it felt as though they were on cruise control all the way through this spouting dialogue which could only have been written by committee it felt totally disjointed and out of context with the story it was trying to portray . On the whole a soulless , vacuum of a film with little to redeem it .",0
"I  known about this movie for many , but , like most people , it  s never been available to see since it  s release in 1954 . It was considered a major success , the theme music was just about all most of us knew of this  blockbuster . I have to say this is the most disappointed I  ever been after seeing a movie I  to see for so long . I  m not a huge fan ( although I love  The ), but I have to admit he  s the best thing in this movie . Unfortunately , that  s not saying a whole lot . The screenplay is a laugh riot of and . Practically everything up until the trouble with the plane is some of the worst acting and writing ever put on film . The music is outstanding . The special effects and the plane set are quite good . Yes , it  s great to see this movie fully and on , but  Airport  is far superior .",0

"I forward to the movie as a sort of super disaster movie . The science of it hokey even in the . Watching the movie it continued to seriously decline . The acting was mostly so so with seeming a bit too stereotyped . The movie out with Jack Hall a climatologist preaching the of global warming to a delegation and insulting the of the US . All through the movie I thought I should be at the church of Green Peace instead of watching a movie . After the initial sermon was we were quickly into fairly well done natural which to have no real basis in the movie except to slip in death and destruction . If it were meant to show a sample of the climate change it only on the  evil  industrial and the likely more severe effects non - industrial would suffer . Then comes the . One of which leaves New York heavily flooded leaving Jack Hall  s son and in a City library . Their fight for survival is and social dynamics completely . I never felt sympathy for the nor did the preaching end at any time . Every scene had subtle political and social . Few with any factual basis . Jack Hall soon as he is proved right by the that only he soon off on an epic journey , or what would be an epic journey that turns into a boring stroll to rescue his son . For a film that environmental are poorly in this film . So not only does the film do disservice to with poor science it is an absolute insult to those who know wolf behavior . A polar bear would have been much more exciting and realistic as the danger to the ( Jack Hall  s son and ). To cut a long and boring narrative short there are cut to blanketed in snow warmly a billion or more US after initially the border . see . . A major Government an entire nation to . War would be a logical result . would not have the to support so many . Where did Canada  s population go or was Canada completely out ? What about in the South . The movie to think only the Northern Hemisphere would be affected . I found this movie to be a grown up fairy tale for lip service . There were some special effects that were cool . Other than that no real reason to see this movie unless you are extremely .",0

I  t wait for the second and third in the trilogy and they  t disappoint ! this story up where the two left off as we follow and Sam on the journey to , by  ( who is superb ). Also you see how to try and reclaim the throne of and to save . Though not everything in the book is included Peter done the best he possibly could and quite frankly it is unbeatable , i would argue with anyone who said this film  t worthy and not a great epic never to be forgotten . the special effects are amazing , the best to date , and the acting is good and emotional all round , , and give stirring . The battle must be the best ever as many a critic said and i agree . They are mostly computer - but are still awesome , i the ( ). Though this is your good old good . evil it  t too predictable and even the multiple  t out of place . As the tag line goes  there is no victory without loss  and as you watch the film this will become apparent . The story is in depth and you have to watch to follow the plot . The film is lengthy but how else could you fit everything in ? It was done superbly and could have been six long and i  t have .

"Over 2000 ago that a selection of true from someone  s life  t necessarily add up to an effective story . THE AVIATOR  s point . Here  s a movie that a lot of really interesting people and them -- not very interesting . The weakness is mainly the superficial script , which the aviation pioneer ( much of this is quite exciting ), the producer ( this is sketchy and disjointed ), the womanizer ( sketchy and ), and the obsessive - compulsive eccentric -- but never quite in all these into a persuasive whole . At the end of this very , very long film , I  t really * feel * anything about , either positive or negative . He as cold and remote at the end as at the beginning and the last hour . What was a screenplay that would make us care about -- either love him or hate him -- the way CITIZEN does . But THE AVIATOR is no . It to cover too much , and you never really know why some were included and ; the result is the covered seem shallow , obvious , and quickly glossed - over . Still , there are a number of excellent in the film . My favorite is  visit to  s family , where her -- as headstrong and self - involved as she is -- treat him with hilarious rudeness . I should confess I have a problem with : I have trouble him as a grown - up . He always to me like a 14 year - old boy an adult in a junior High School play . He  s a pretty good actor ; he himself and he  s quite talented . I don  t know why that boyish thing me , just as it did in TITANIC , where more like his aunt than his lover . Even  s period mise en scene to persuade . The and are all so colorful , so squeaky - clean , they seem made for a musical comedy rather than a serious period drama . And too many obvious , such as the movie that him the public now sound . Of course it  s THE JAZZ SINGER . As in NEW YORK , NEW YORK , there  s a ton of painstaking period detail , but it  t ring true . You don  t feel you  re really in the 1930s and 40s , any more than you believe as Jean . Cate a little too hard as , though it  s basically an intelligent and effective performance . Her strenuous to imitate  s well - known vocal are at times . So I can see why THE AVIATOR lit no either at the box office or at the . A huge amount of work and money went into a film that is frequently interesting , but finally not all that compelling .",1

Unleashed ( as I saw it ) with gangster Bob and the their protection money , with Jet Li ( the Dog ) around on his leash as a threat , much as you might with a or Pit Bull terrier . Those who don  t pay get seven of .. something beaten out of their bloody , broken . This is not the purity of Kung Fu , oh no , this is martial crossed with no - - barred pub fighting : , snapped , furniture broken , broken , and a great deal of hair removal by alone . Pay up , or pay now and then pay up . Stuff ( I  m not going to ruin it ), and himself alone and taken under the wing of blind piano tuner Morgan Freeman (  Morgan Freeman  on full wisdom & ). By and by , ( who  s been raised - and badly - like a dog ) to be and the small life can bring . ACTION : this is not a bad thing . Jet Li somehow to stay the right side of  cute , Morgan Freeman to express as well as a warm welcome , and thanks to superb sound and we get one of the most tense I  ever seen in any film . I was literally holding my breath , totally up , and thinking  God no ! Don  t do that !!!. Beware if this Director ever to do Horror - it could be so scary he  have the audience carried out on & oxygen . Anyway ,  s past up with him . It always does , usually about two - of the way through a film . And then we  re back to some more serious violence , by a brief pause before even more serious violence , a  boss battle  which me of the albino in Kiss of the Dragon , and the inevitable confrontation at the end . There  s some back - story & thrown in too , but not so much as to be annoying . Then the film is over , you walk out of the cinema , and text the mate who  t join you to tell him he an INCREDIBLE film , ha ha , and I  see it again if you want to go . Special mention for Jet Li - a tour de force , not just in the action but also for his portrayal of a man who basically been from a very young age , and is even of himself . Special mention for Bob - who I  not really rated before , but here he to flesh out a very convincing , reprehensible character . Great dialogue him a verbal dexterity we don  t usually see in our cardboard - cutout , as well as a definite emotional connection to ( twisted though it is ). We  re clearly supposed to see him as one of those dog who his dog very badly , but still for it in his own sick way . Special mention for the director & editor - for fabulous fight , with LONG so we can actually see Jet Li  s skill and Wo Ping  s choreography . Also for pace and interest through the middle where most would die on their . Also for AMAZING tension ( because YES , in real life if you try to rehabilitate / domesticate a wild animal there  s always the threat that it could flip out and kill you without meaning to ). Also for perhaps the only film I  ever seen with A ) car that don  t end in ridiculous and B ) that survive car AND show of ! Where is this crazy wave of realism going to end !? We  have to eat , sleep and go to the toilet next .. I can only think of two minor : 1 ) The middle of the film place over a few ( or several ) - but you don  t get much of a sense of time passing . Like it in Team , maybe we a montage ( montage , yeah !). 2 ) There  s quite a big plot point that goes completely unresolved . I can  t explain too much , but essentially I believe a significant   scene is missing from the final third . The main story  t need it , but I would like to have seen what .

"I suppose no picture could live up to the that surrounded this long lost produced film and a lot of people have of seeing it in the . it in that context us a better perspective on the value . in its favor is the gorgeous restoration and the sound is great too , though the famous theme is repeated so often it rapidly put on the shelf reserved for melodic to which we have now become impervious . Some good acting as well from , Stack , and a nicely Newton . However many of the individual don  t hold up well at all in environment and I  m not even talking about the security back then . I won  t even discuss the preposterous story and acting from the newlywed bride ( who I hoped would have been thrown off the plane along with the luggage ). The other are so ; the heart of gold grade - B actress , the been beauty queen worried about meeting her frontier man (!); is saddled with a story that I  t figure out about a  crying towel , his usual steely eyed tycoon accused by an ineffectual of stealing wife . Added is a brat running up and down the plane with a toy airplane who apparently was given a sedative to shut up since he through the whole ordeal . Of course it not this fault that its hard to watch it without thinking of Airplane . All that said , it great historical value as one of the the first disaster and very well executed it is too .

"I saw it at a screening recently and was drawn into this great film from the very opening shot . The director does a great job of telling a complex story in an interesting way . His pace and visual technique kept the film moving in a languid yet urgent way ( I say this because I remember thinking that there were very few quick in the film , yet I never felt the  drag  that is usually associated with bad ). The cast was first rate and the script gave them lots to work with . . will likely get an nod for his performance , it me of his great work in  The Patient . was great too , but I felt she  t get enough screen time to truly show off her .

"2001 : A Space . left his mark in cinema with a wide selection of , both big and small . Whilst not on his most controversial list , 2001 : A Space , must be his most thought provoking story of man and his . With the exception of a few , this film in my is more an artistic composure of space ; as an example , to spend three , four , even five watching a ship on a space station would seem all too slow , boring and even dull , but , and his genius film making made it a thing of art . Up until this release , all both action and not would have spent 95 % of screen time pushing the story forward with dialogue and simple camera movement . Now although sticks with this outline , the special effects can be at as if a piece of gold . To this day , i still can not be sure what is real and what is not and I  never to ask or find out . Some are best left unblemished , and to the imagination . Although art , this is still a film . We get a story , but instead of being told we are to figure the concept out by our own will ; which in the case of watching this film is easier said then done . Although complex , and without any true conclusion , i still have the basic theory and believe I  thumbed down on what was trying to tell . was the scary plot for me . A man losing control of his was a scary concept that left me in a dilemma of what I  just seen and what it meant . The truth : man control of -- a man is lost without his . ( SPOILER !) The final supper scene was the , and took the to find out . It took some research , but i now understand what was trying to say , which was . Body and soil , glass and wine . The glass but the wine is still their . All in all this film was and in my opinion still is utterly and one of the best story ever ; and the unknown . I can  t help but give it a high score . 97 / 100",0
"Take 2 pathetic , mix with generous of vulgarity and repetitious profanity , and you have this childish attempt at entertainment . This insipid movie is not advised for anyone over 13 .

If you are in the unfortunate position of being cognizant throughout the movie , you can note these along the way . Two men embark upon a  road trip  into the wine of . One , a writer , is who is a man without confidence and seemingly without hope . He is also a character with whom the viewer does not wish to identify . Yet , the other  protagonist , Jack , is without brains or character .

Jack is an even more repulsive character than . For fear of a spoiler , I will not divulge if Jack . ( Who .) I will also not divulge if his confidence . ( Again , who .) Yet , the hilarious in - between the beginning and end will leave 12 - year - rolling in the . For , the childish and predictable  humor  will be boring , the language grating , and the in appeal .

And prior to watching this flotsam of the movie industry , I encourage anyone ( over 21 and at home ) to imbibe heavily in noir as it may improve the movie ( or destroy any memory of it ).

"I have to admit the movie  t good . It  s an average movie that is watchable ... Being this a game inspired movie , it  s not a  look it  s just the same thing as the game  movie . Something being inspired by other  t necessarily mean it  s a by - the - book translation ... The important thing in a movie being inspired by a game is to have , at least , the feeling or the story ( or both ) of the game , in the movie ... that said ... I think the character of could have been better accomplished than what it was , and I think that the spirit , the feeling , of the game  t truly there ... I think this to resemble the most with the survival horror / puzzle action feeling of the 4 , not grasping some key stuff of the game ... I think boll only at some of the of the game like the being afraid of the dark and stuff like that and directly to the movie , not thinking of the why it was there and the feeling of the previous and the background of ... The acting was poor , not because of the I think , but mainly because of stuff like ... glasses in a woman  t make her a scientist ! The story had some good and the action sequence against the swarm of was directed . I think that the worst of the story was the way it was directed ... And I think that the love scene was completely / unnecessary ... I think that it  s one of those  this horror in the movie genre name so we must provide a love scene  case . It  s a movie with poor acting , some good in the , mostly bad directed , with some good in the action but not well ... I still think that the movie is watchable with , even with those , being this a completely average movie with no . Also I have a comment to make ... I have seen many people on Tara ... Sometimes when the acting  t good or great the fault  t solely in the actor ... If we  d put in a role of a  wood film  character , than I think must of us would go  What the hell ? and think  t act to save is life , when that  s an false assumption ... Not because of the story , but because of the director ... It  s like a sports team ... More than 50 % is due to the coach ... Also , that  s one of today  s en vogue and best , had the reputation of not being the best of , being an average actor , and with in such as  The mystic river  that image a much higher level . I think that tara room for improvement and we  t bash and actor / actress in a general case ... Each movie is different ... Just like ... His role in Rocky I and were , , well ...",1

At the end of the movie , you  walk out of the feeling greatly disappointed . The plot was pointless and the was not exactly suburb , especially when you are a lot from a master mind horror director . as went a little too far in of his creepy character and did a short , but satisfactory job as a doctor . another who out exactly like the first did . Their relationship was poorly and again slightly pointless . Overall the whole idea of the second ring was sort of unnecessary . It  t show the same horror and the same cleverness that was displayed in the first one . Don  t expect THAT much from the Ring Two . Like I said , it was not bad , but not good either .",1

The experience a transition from mundane , but happy to living , where death to be a better option . Drug addiction is a common theme in but this film is limitless in the scope of the issue . From young people needing cash to the lonely and elderly . Their change in a way I could never imagine . is also prominent , with split used in tight , camera - work to increase the intensity of a certain scene , whether violent or serene . Music is important and the musical score here is catchy and emotive , perfectly for this film . The acting is also amazing . This film , unlike of its time does not rely on visual effects , but the skill of the cast and crew which this film a work of pure genius .",1
"Being in a profession where there is constant noise , I this movie for a very odd reason . The are away from a up society , away from a world , much of which is based on needless , trivial noise . Everywhere they go there is more numbing action . Watching the director of the commercial , trying to act like a real film director , despite the fact that they are doing a 30 second liquor commercial , some of what this movie is about , a world where people are worn into the ground by a type A culture that is as vapid and unnecessary as we can imagine . I thought the Bill character tremendously . While this trip to Japan was excruciatingly dull ( money  t everything ), I believe that he to see he  t seen before . I that while he was struggling with his marriage , the crises were simple , day to day that living to us . The young woman he through a whimsical kindness , that he is worth something . She is refreshing to look at an to be with . He , like many middle aged men , self . Because she a sense of purity and can talk to him honestly about her world and his , he should go back to his life a little more sustained .",1

"We all know the story of the full of angst ; it  s an old tale . But this movie the and put him into a new situation . The end of the world ! Seriously though , the atmosphere of this movie you and attached throughout the whole film . The story line is thought provoking and quite deep ; it leaves quite a lot of the story open for the viewer to view it in their own way ( intentional or not ..). This lead to most people saying that , to get the real idea of   you should watch it at least twice . Well in my opinion there is no need , I understood most of the story in the first . The only problem being that with misunderstanding of the story this film could be as rubbish . ( I have also been told that this film is stupid because it no sense , this was by the same person who said exactly the same about the less matrix ?) The film is about a ( conveniently ) who been  emotional  for some time . This lead to be seeing a therapist about it , this no effect on his . been of this 6 tall rabbit , frank . The first time we encounter Frank we discover that the world will end in 28 days , 6 , 42 and 12 . So we follow for the next 28 days , with his development on the end of the world . With more with Frank ( don  t worry it all becomes clear close to the end ) and such as  Grandma Death ,  s , and family all add to  s development and his that , with fate , we all die alone . As you can probably guess this is no  sexy cheerleader , oh my God she is taking them off  teen movie but a deep thought provoking film about alienation and the meaning of life . Not that this film is perfect it some . I felt that his , full of special effects to go on a bit too long . I got the point of Frank after a while ; I  t need to know that  t stab him because of a force field . The only I can find wrong are tiny pathetic like that , so no major . I  t advise people to go and see this if you are too lazy ( or stupid ) to think about what is happening . Also if you enjoy the mindless trash then this is not the movie for you . But for all the people who are willing to go and watch a thinking movie then , this is for you ! So go and watch it now you .",1
"This is one of the I have seen in a quite a while . The graphics are great and the story is really entertaining . I  always animation like this , kind of old school . They  come up with an interesting story line that really itself well to being brought to life this way . It  s about a who a space suit and is then on his way to becoming a new super hero . It will be interesting to see where they take the story from here . I am definitely keep a watch for more from and all the that were involved with this production .",1
"Sure ,  The Day After Tomorrow  is entertaining enough to watch but as a movie it  t really a good one . The are flat and hollow and the story substance and a well build up ending . Also they manage once more to put in some disaster movie and over - and unlikely . I  m sure director also tried to make a political statement with this movie but he terribly with all of his in this movie . In the movie the government more concerned with their budget than the global environment and express this arrogantly openly in public . Well not even in real life the government is THAT arrogant as in this movie . All those scene  s were to make a political statement are rather laughable and unlikely than anything else really . Yes , sure the movie some nice and cool looking special effects with lots of stuff getting crushed , and blown away ala  s other movie ,  Independence Day  but thats about the only good and positive thing that can be said about this movie . The story itself is quite and unlikely and  t feel realistic enough because everything is over - so much , just like in disaster from the  70  s was always the case . The movie is filled with some pointless action ( the attack ) and pointless ( the always tea - drinking Holm character and for instance ) a story - line on a group of young student is always risky , since most of the time they are always by annoying and bad . This however is not the case in this movie . Jake and are splendid and they manage to portray some likable . This movie is fairly watchable as entertainment but it still is not a movie that I would recommend to everyone . 5 / 10http :// bobafett1138 . . /",0

There were occasionally like with the and jellyfish . Although , I think this movie did to me what it was supposed to do . I have not gone diving ever since I saw it .

The acting is first - rate , except for who I din  t like much , Bale , bean and though . The script is good , and direction is solid by who had directed nothing notable before this . His script is good , better than The Recruit which is the only other film written by that I have seen . Equilibrium had some very good gun and action as well , only problem I had with it was the fact that it from so many other or of literature .

"The best movie of 2005 by a long shot ! This is not just a karate movie ( though plenty of that is included ). This is the best script ever written in a good versus evil plot .

Li a trained killer ( the Dog ) who goes off on anyone around him when his dog - collar is removed . But he also a primal innocence and that becomes evident when he that his master ( the ever evil Bob ) been down and so he home a blind piano tuner ( the ever Godlike Morgan Freeman ) and ultimately to decide between killing and loving .

"The Ring as a sequel is not bad in that the main and story line are really continuous from the first movie . I was anxious to see this film as I had so many negative when the film was in the theater I was apprehensive that this was another bad sequel . I was pleasantly that this movie a soul of its own that on the creepiness of the original without a basic repeat of the first movie . The cinematography , score and special effects are top notch and the odd use of jerky motion by the ghost Tamara in the film add to the creepiness . The film is a gray toned film from start to finish which a dark foreboding atmosphere . I especially like the score for one very simple reason . It is a real orchestral piece without the usual of screaming or corny three note horror to give away the suspense . The film itself seriously throughout and I think the element of credibility to the story . I was a bit and disappointed at the anti - climatic ending however , and felt that a ending probably would have made more sense . This movie and its predecessor are the first time in a long time I have actually watched a horror thriller where I genuinely was left a bit out after watching it . If any movie can do that to me , I give it hearty credit .",1
"The first third of the movie was well done especially the first 15 or so - it was deranged , strange , and well told with the main character  s description of his past and the way the time by . You see the torment . Some very witty shine too with him wondering whether imaginary training can carry into the real world . However the violence often becomes too much of a spectacle and at times too . While the visual content sometimes I question , the style and make - up of the cinematography is well done . Unfortunately as is often the case with - the ending ; the twist is more for shock value and very predictable - they would  done better going a traditional route with it , or at least something with a little more integrity . Also , the final suicide is absolutely pointless further . How could the father make that decision also ?? Anyway , worth a look if you can handle the utter lack of integrity to stoop to for entertainment  s sake I guess - are you by immoral , base , and twisted ? If so enjoy .",0
"The film had my heart thumping , my and my sense of  s stereotyping from beginning to end . Arresting both scenery and .

Film both sound and were such that the movie a high - paced suspension of disbelief , albeit much of the movie being relatively implausible .

"Many people , and alike , are panning this movie . As a fan , I to see it for myself . As it , I it a great deal . I think that part of the issue for those who don  t like it is that this is not an example of linear storytelling . In fact , later in the film , realism is totally - the story into the realm of the symbolic . I think that reading  The of Enchantment  by would enhance the enjoyment of this movie for many people .  s use of the symbolism from many of our most famous archetypal fairy tales had my head spinning ( that  s in a positive way !) , maybe it like a real drag for someone to suggest that you read a book before you see this movie . Actually , I  m not suggesting that - most people  t be interested in doing that , anyway . It  s a shame , though , because ultimately I don  t think there is a large audience for this movie . I feel that it will achieve  cult status  ( as so many of  s have before ). It really does help to have the background in the archetypal of  Hansel and ,  Little Red Riding Hood ,  ,  Sleeping Beauty ,  Snow White  and that the book , though - with that knowledge , this film can be seen as a really exceptional piece of entertainment .",0
"I  read quite a few about The Ring Two on this site and agree with a lot of the negative people have written , such as the lack of tension , the use and pointlessness of some of the special effects , seemingly struggling to deliver the dialogue and convince us that she  s got her heart in this film , and especially for me that annoying and failing to be creepy who just won  t stop saying  , , . For  s sake we know her name alright !!! But .... I  m a big fan of horror , in particular the offering from the original Ring series to The Eye and Shutter , and I don  t think they  re always supposed to appear as straight forward as they first might ( watch  s Dark Water and then watch it again about it with a major thinker .... I did ). As the Ring Two was directed by I just can  t accept he went so wrong with it . I think as a  scary movie  it , but as a concept it nearly works . I read the review by from titled  A movie , and it got me thinking - Read it , it  s on page three of the review list . In short , this writer that the point of the film  s imagery and are there as a to recreate the spooky video tape with and that annoying as the new , given that many of the that happen to them mimic Samara and her mother  s life . I think that  s a pretty good point . It also made me think more about the tag - line ... Fear Comes Full Circle .... suggesting that The Ring and The Ring Two are two halves ( semi ) of the whole concept , where part two is designed to make you watch part one again , thus a Ring of it  s own ... us watching these over and over - a vicious circle ! this won  t happen as part two is a bit crap in of entertainment value but I think the and symbolism are there for a good reason . I don  t know if what i  just written perfect sense but if you read the guy from  s review , hopefully it will begin to .",1
"is pretty good at this nonsense of several of the same nature within 6 . Inevitably , one of them is always better than the other and here - where we have The Descent and The Cave ... well , let  s just say that if you saw The Descent , don  t even bother with this . They  t the same film , no but they  re very similar . I mean , exactly how much leeway is there in a trapped - in - a - cave - with - story ? It  s pretty much your standard monster fare , just trapped in a cave - so you have like - the dark and ... well , caving . This is where differ from The Descent slightly , people are diving all over the shop here Don  t worry , the acting is all pretty horrible and there is plenty of that loathsome flickering - cut - every - second . There  s perhaps one aspect of the film that might surprise you ... but only if you  re a dullard and it  s not exactly novel . At the end of the day , the film to little more than a generic monster film and if you want to see subterranean horror - I must surely recommend the far superior  The Descent .",1

Do you wonder this film is a muddle ? - as usual - is much more at home with atmosphere than and the film is often fascinating to look at .

"I just saw this movie this morning and it was wonderful . Not exactly what I was , but better as it turns out . It was a bit morbid and frightening in , not something I would suggest the small to . The special effects were very well done . I thought they did a good job casting the movie also . The make - up artist should get an award , it can  t be easy making both and Ledger look that unattractive . It was very nice to see something that  t a remake of a television show from my childhood , this was a very ingenious movie . I strongly recommend this movie , I it enough I would pay to see it again .",0
"Some work best with their own material . They can use another  source material , like a classic novel or a newspaper article . But at the end of the process a film must bear the mark of the director . He must have many different . This is why many of the that most consider visionary best works come when they write , produce , and direct . This is the undeniable flaw of Terry  s latest film THE GRIM , it  s got all the of  s brilliant attention to detail , it  s whimsical , and full of life and color , and yet the screenplay is full of that are not fully because they are so small in scope and is too large in vision THE GRIM and ( and Heath Ledger ), the very of the title , two con - traveling around in 1812 . They have the whole countryside believing that they have and battled all matter of evil thing , and it  s not until they stumble into some real evil that the story going . Somebody 11 little and it  s up to the to discover who  s behind the nefarious plot . They are by ( ), a young woman who  s two were the first taken . To try to sum up the story any more would just confuse you . It  s a story that is far in texture , and screenwriter bitten of a little more than they can chew . But they give it a shot and for the most part succeed . Some of the extraneous the Army are silly and stop the film cold . I could have also done without Peter  s over the top acting , which at times was more grating than silly . I especially his thick accent that render much of what he unintelligible . should be because what does work in the film works so well . I all the in the tower . I every moment that the Brother  s are in the forest . I love how filled the forest with life . I the colors , and the drab and how they meshed together . I that the film made me laugh . It  s so hard to find a film with such genuine and unforced in it . I also believe the last twenty of the film were . was divine in a role that could have been by any pretty little thing . In her and with  s attention to detail her final are as awe - inspiring as the dancing scene in THE OF BARON . As a matter of fact many will probably find many to the unfairly film made in 1989 . Both are rich in detail and try to handle too much at once , and yet both are passionate and it  s in their passion that the true beauty and wonder of our take hold . THE GRIM may have trouble finding a audience to embrace it . This is a film that will probably bore the and yet will find a cult audience that will eat it up . Like previous in the fantasy genre like LEGEND or , GRIM is a film that will take and cable to find its audience . I mast say the biggest disappointment is the from AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM ending that felt on and not . This film had a natural and far more interesting final shot before the film that I would have preferred but alas , I was not in the cutting room ( but maybe I should have been ). At the end of the day what  t work is the story which while layered very few . You can see what is doing on the screen and how hard he  s trying to overcome the weakness in the script and yet  s script is far too small for vision . I would have like to have seen what would have done if he  d tackled the script as well . I see his personal on the screen . I just a more personal touch on the story . All in all the is satisfying . It  s a good movie that will stand the test of time . There is an audience of people that will be receptive to it , even if the won  t . It  s a great concept film with a lackluster script .",0
"i went to see this film the other day .... i really like that involve a bit of mystery , and some jumpy , but this film was just slow and the only reason i stayed in the cinema was to see if they got out of the cave in the end ... the plot was clever , thought out i would say but it  t at all jumpy or scary which i came to expect from the way the made the film come across .... i  d see and the Chocolate Factory for a 3rd time than see this again , but i Really that film ... : Di don  t want to completely insult the film , its a good piece of and acting but just  t entertain me personally ...",1
"Great , Great Movie . Based on the critical of it , I had something quite different - like a snooze fest or something . I was greatly . I guess this to remind us why movie do what they do - they  t get doing anything else ! It did come across as a bit anti - - who are now the epitome of all  cultured , anti - and socialist - so maybe that is why the it . But it is an excellent movie . One is from start to finish . I went into this as open minded as I could . True , Terry gave us all Time and Brazil , and for those alone when he he will go to movie heaven and become a legend . But this piece on its own as a great piece of entertainment and story telling .",0
"This movie was what I it to be . Decent . I give it 7 out of 10 because it was a C movie . I  t anything spectacular with this title because I knew the director  s work and I saw the . Now , the good about this movie are definitely the very dark humor , and Heath Ledger  s acting . He really me with his performance in this movie . It  s been a long time since I actually felt somewhat sorry for a character in a movie . But you  understand why . He  s submissive because of a terrible mistake he  d made when he was a young child and his older brother by .  s performance was good ( not great ) and he did disappoint in some . The humor was quite good and the gore from this movie fit the . So that was all good . A bad aspect was probably the timing of the movie . It would have been a good movie or it would have been a good movie to show in less dark times . This year for   , unfortunately , and the dark , gory nature of this film just  t timely . That was my main complaint . That and a bit of a lack - luster ending in which it they lost a lot of energy and just sort of shot it . Besides that , I recommend this movie . It was a decent flick , just not too timely .",0
"This movie just  t know what it to be ! Is it a comedy ? Sort of . Is it a fantasy ? , sort of . Is it a dark drama ? Yeah , sort of . It just  t know what it  s trying to be , so it a little in everything , and does nothing well . It some great talent , and good , and a great premise , but in the end , it a script to do justice to any of the . The script too hard to include too many of the  s Fairy tales into one story , rather than a few good , and leaving room for a legitimate sequel . Frankly , I would really like to see Heath Ledger and in another picture together with a better script . Bottom line analysis : Too many , not enough cohesion , mildly disappointing , and not worth the eight admission . See this one in the dollar .",0
"I had to watch this movie three times , I fell asleep during the ape part twice . Anyway , my advice is to watch the movie when you are at the peak of your mental , so that you can analyze what is going on . Yet I will warn you , even then you will never really be sure . First of all , if you don  t believe in the theory of evolution , you may feel to fast forward through the ape . However , you should still watch to understand the relevance of the to the . The first part of the ape sequence the savagery of the species , who are under attack from each other and other . Then the black monolith and a strange sound and the . It tall and erect and is . Next , you see a lone ape , who I consider the leader of the pack , figure out he can use a bone as a weapon . Shortly after that , the two of that were fighting for territory , meet up again . However , the armed with , are standing upright and show their strength when they kill one of the of the opposing pack . This pack of to have a more advanced form of intelligence and show the of dominance . Cut to a space ship in space , which similar in shape to the bone the lone ape was holding . The ship like it is free falling in space , when you realize it is actually . I have to pause to address the music in the movie . I think made a wise choice of music for this film . During the ape scene , we get what like a chorus mumbling / singing unintelligible , they sound other worldly and the chorus and their singing frenzied . Once we get to space , we have the most famous waltz of all time , that everyone on the planet at one point . That waltz is universal . a waltz , instead of - fi music , the audience a sense of familiarity , while into an unknown world . Also the waltz a certain monotonous feel to it , which may heighten the sense of in space . When get out of control , we get the chorus again , which the audience  s sense of anxiety . Next , we move to the audience seeing space travel , the effects of anti - gravity , how one eats in space . We move on to meeting company man , . , whose purpose was to smooth over any about on . The movie tedious at this point , but you have to listen to the conversation he with the other scientist and the presentation he at a meeting for some basic information that up the heart of the film . Once we get on board with and the crew and meet , whose voice is seductive and menacing at the same time , the film up steam again . We come across the black monolith again , this time on the moon . The monolith a piercing sound , which the . Now at this point , the monolith to be an enemy of man . Very contradictory to the way the monolith with the , who no harm when in the presence of the monolith . Is man getting too close and about to overpower the monolith , or is the monolith afraid of losing its dominance over man ? 18 later we are on the journey to with and the crew . Before any place , visually the audience a sense of the ship , the isolation on the ship , the routine of the ship , and the dominance of . Now another theory at work in the movie is man versus , which back in 1968 must have like a portal into doom . We see the level of trust the crew in . Yet , through the use of the monotony of  s voice , the audience is to develop a distrust of the computer before anything goes wrong . Then the  event  . a problem with the ship and the realize he made and error on purpose and they propose to in effect  kill  him . However , first and to take out the two . In a battle between man and machine back on the ship , only to discover through a message from . , that was once , that really had no control over his after all . Free will versus destiny . Again there is mention of contact with the monolith , but we never see the rest of the message . then out to finish the mission . Again we see the beauty of , with the use of primary colors , a kind of - effect on  s . You also get a sense of the horror , which the chorus . Now we get to the the planet , which is really a room ? At this point , you have to make a decision as to if this is really  s mind and his way of coping what is happening to him , or is this the end of the journey ? The monolith is back acting as a mechanism that perception and reality . is old when he , due to the effects of the travel or from being in space for a long period of time ? There to be a trinity of : the old man in the bed , the man at the table , and the fetus at the end . Is suddenly reborn , because he an alternate form of being ? at the end to be reborn . At the end , you see the fetus orbit in space , or in the womb of space and in harmony with the other . Everything a feeling of resolution , and the waltz again .",0
"I  agree with buffylover111 on the poor acting and predictability of the movie ( man you just KNOW what  s happen next , no surprise at all ) but if you  re like me and just love monster you won  t regret seeing it . Because of the creature  s look and the general feel it me of a cross between , Pitch black and The terror within . Although it  s not very scary there  s a lot of who eat a bunch of people and it just what I want from that kind of film . I  given it 8 because although it  s a great entertainment , the acting and the are just too bad and not even in a cheesy way , there  s just plainly bad . In the last , when they  re in the last cave with the torch lit and the mist I thought they just into an set , it wrong .",1
"I think I have seen just about every Horror , scary , ghosty , witchy movie that ever been made - and this one was definitely the worst . I guess the only thing to scare today  s is properly music and creepy . The story line was choppy to say the least . And - oh my ! Bill , I adore you - WHATEVER are you doing in a loser like this one ???? The only  Grudge  I could see was punishment from the director . And the must have had a grudge against this one . If it had been possible to vote a  zero  on this one , I would have . Please - don  t waste your time on this movie - there are so many other scary that are both scary and interesting .",1
"I think that I was like a lot of people who assumed that this movie was just going to be a spin off of National Treasure . I never really to see it , but my little brother dragged me to it . Actually , I think that it was just a mistake about it so soon to when they had National Treasure . It gave people too much time to see National Treasure and assume that it was going to be identical . Don  t get me wrong , I National Treasure , but this movie was really good too . There were lots of big and fast paced . The the movie was shot in was beautiful , there were some great dessert . I really the plot of the movie , it did seem a little like and National Treasure , but all Action / Adventure tend to follow a lot of the same . and made a great team and I hope to see them do another movie together , and is an amazing actress . Overall , I think that everyone should go out and rent it , it  s just a fun movie to watch .",1
"... they will get it right . Better than many angry fan - ( myself included ) would have you believe , it still  t as good as it should have been . pick a heat signature underneath the ice layer in the Antarctic . A research team and accidentally the alien within . , a pack of young predator arrive to begin their initiation hunt into adulthood . 3 species , only one survivor . The first , huge mistake the film is it  s white - washed - 13 rating . All four  Alien  and both   were pretty hard R - rated ; so why ostracize the of the in such a way ? Answer : so that can  t in too , even though it  s a horror / action film that  t be watching anyways . Next up is the of the film . Every one going to see this the deal with the , the deal with the and that they are going to be fighting each other . So why spend the first 57 of a 100 minute movie trying to wrap all the plot in a mystery ? Answer : actually , I don  t have anything for that , there was just no reason for it . If you make a film  X . Y  you better not take 2 / 3 of the film for X and Y to start scrapping on each other . Which finally up what the film does right ; once the pointless exposition ( which to ever explain that the are supposed to be ) is over and the action in the film into high gear and along at a break neck pace . The first battle between the two malevolent is a great bit of action violence ; my only complaint with it is that it the dull first hour of the film look all the more dull by comparison . It does finally give you what you want , it just you wait a long time for it . For the first hour of the film , it give it a 4 , the last 40 get an 8 ; - 6 / 10",1
"I from who went to the to see this movie that it was really bad so I  t buy the . They were right . A friend who let me watch this movie and I was so dissatisfied with it that I had to go to   to find out who is responsible for this 1hr 50 minute waste of time .  The Ring  is an remake of a good horror flick just like  The Grudge .  The Ring Two  is unbearable until you get to the last few . lack the heart they had ago . Now we have nothing but to that  t that good to begin with , and to sum up with 2 of chaos . We  re running out of .",1
"Yes , I at the end of Finding Neverland . It the minor on my effectively enough , but the film from a slight lack of momentum , largely because of the of and . , a dandyish figure with a mid - Atlantic accent , is a puzzling comic - relief character whose screen presence is rather than engaging . I found myself thinking , whenever he ,  It  s ! What  s he doing here ? And is he supposed to be or ? To be fair to , it is possible that his accent was a perfect rendition of what like in J . M .  s time , but he never comfortable in the role . And is just a bit wooden . Again , perhaps he is meant to be restrained - the film is set in after all . But  s soft and phlegmatic response to any event , no matter how dramatic , the film a little flat . If someone had run in and  Run for your , the house is on fire  you feel that would have pensive and  , dear . We  have to put it out , then . It  t help that the central drama - a main character  s disease - is so far in advance that you can  t believe it is a surprise to anyone when it its grand entrance . Still , is excellent as ever in her rose role and the are very good indeed . If you are of a , Finding Neverland will not let you down . But to other ranked in the Movie  s top 250 it is decidedly weak .",0
"To get it off my chest , I * like * South Park . I the movie . Don  t get me wrong , I  get  and Trey  s brand of humor . However , TA just  t do anything for me in the least . It  s not funny , not especially well - written , and , worst of all , boring . I know I probably won  t change any die - hard  , but I really don  t see the humor in this . The plot is paper - thin at best , and there  t a whole lot of worth laughing over . Most of the  humor  comes from the fact that it  s doing all this crazy action stuff . But after the first 15 min ., the novelty of that off and we  re left with a pretty weak action - adventure comedy . The problem with doing an action - adventure with is that they  re not very mobile . Sure , the set piece in * should * have been funny , but because the shamble , any energy is drained out of the scene . This problem terrible when there  s a supposed fist - fight between on TA - er ( ?) and Sam , but I  t even tell what was going on . Maybe if it was a full cartoon this could have worked . Instead , it  s just really really draggy . The actual plot as a satire , because it  t even know what to satirize . The liberal barely act like their real , and neither do the pro - war on terror . It  s like and Trey tried to make a movie and remain as ignorant as possible about what they were  . The constant like a 10 year old who just learned some dirty . It  s used almost without any real reason , aside from the fact you  re supposed to find it funny that a puppet . Same thing with the FAG joke .... by the 60th time you hear that joke , you realize it  t ever funny to begin with . But I did like the song  , F * Yeah ! That 3 .",0
"Personally , I the movie ... I mean sure if you don  t know who the really were , it  t make a lot of sense . But if you know who they were and what they did , it sense . It summed up a lot of the fairy tales and folk that they travelled to find out . I mean it  t exactly like the I know , but how many are exactly what they are supposed to be ? I thought the visual effects were very well done . I found it convincing , I mean of course it  s not going to be 100 % realistic since it is about fairy tales such as , Little Red , Goldilocks , Sleeping Beauty , and Snow White . Oh ya and Hansel and . I thought the acting was well done in it . And I also thought it was funny ... I found myself laughing out loud at the . One thing I  t like was the wolf / father guy . That was just creepy ... How did he turn into the wolf ? I  t understand that .",0
"*** May contain **** It  s been seven since Terry helmed a film . As a fan of the director , I was very excited to see that he had a new project . Unfortunately , just watched the film , I  t recommend it to . You probably know the story - the go from village to village as - for - hire . Then they get discovered by the and they must dispel a real magical curse or die . The film is by many and from fairy tales , Little Red Riding Hood , Hansel & , , the evil queen from Snow White , . However , it  s really a mess . The story  t very engaging and neither are the . The best  role  is by , who is the diabolical mirror queen . But sadly , she  t in the film very much , maybe 20 , if that . Peter who is usually pretty good in - most notably the lunatic in - is so annoying , I hoped that his character was a minor one . Alas , no . The are equally heinous .  s pronunciation is abysmal , and the film  s overall depiction of the is , once again , ridiculous . I guess they are the new target of these days , being as cruel , careless and power mad . I  m quite frankly getting tired of it . The special effects are pretty good , particularly the flying witch during an early exorcism , and the frog licking is kind of cute , but this film never really what it to be . Is it funny ? Is it fantasy ? It  s certainly excessive in length . My biggest gripe is that it  t even know what it  s message is . One of the that was the cause of the destruction of the forest and , I guess , the people who the area with folklore - the kind that is trying to preserve . The , too , stand as a symbolic of  the Enlightenment . After all ,  s character to burn the and vanquish the . But in the end , he , himself , is because of a trick cross . So which is it ? Triumph of folklore , the and or rational thought ? I wish had figured out where he stood before he turned in his screenplay . More often than not , Heath Ledger to . The Order is a great example of that , so I think if he  s in a film , I might skip it . , I  keep giving your a chance . ( I like most of what he  s been in .) . . I hate to say it , but this film stunk . Back to the drawing board .",0
", now 5 out of 10 I feel is being generous , but , as it only to the original story of this twisted tale ! Praise to the original of RING ... the story are fantastic ... forgive me for being so  bold  but I don  t feel that   can capture it right . The ring was scary - it was new , bold and special effects made you go look at that !... but with the ring two you knew it was coming , it was , therefore unsavory . to make look  cooler .. by in of special effects .. scary music ( supposedly ).. . I watched this with the anticipation of looking away in fright and wet my jeans .. similar effect to the ring 1 .... but no such luck ... ...  t even desire to lift my to cover up ... was totally .. in fact i  been more watching the night forty ....... the special effects in this movie ... oh gosh .. like so cheaply done .. worse than the tech of van .. or the like of fantastic four .. i  seen been better done ... peace out all ... and sleep tight ! ( i  see you tonight sam ;-)",1
"Not for everyone , but enjoyable if you like this sort of thing . As a fantasy writer I found it funny with a tad bit of darkness . You must remember these are supposed to be about fairy tales . The will be rather daft and have a sort of stereotypical quality ... This is what was making off of after all , of course they  have irritating that make them just plain stupid . I wish their had been more character development but it like it would have been hard to fit it in anyway . The side I felt were fine and dandy . They were loopy and a bit on the stupid side just like in most tales . ( take the snails for instance if you ever get to read the book and no this nothing to do with the movie ) I felt a little unfulfilled by some of it . I more for why were the way they were . What had to make those certain happen ? Why  t this ? . . All in all ... If you a horror , this is not for you . I honestly thought it would be , but I it anyway ... But this also for you who are looking for a comedy . My opinion .",0
"Those who expect to see this movie and expect a Exorcism ala Blair will not be disappointed . There a few when into the actual exorcism which the young actress in an apt and realistic manner . However , this movie is more of a dramatic thriller rather than a horror film . I as always am very with the talented Laura . She never to bring complexity and range to each character . I felt that oddly the movie was more about rather than Rose . I was a slightly ending to the film . I do recommend seeing this movie in for the chill effect . It did spark an interest in Rose and I plan to do more research .",0
"This movie was as being a thriller , but what they don  t show is that the whole thing is a trial . The only that are shown on television are the small that are during the trial . The acting by the prosecutor ( he  s some unknown actor ) is laughable , it  s so bad . Laura  t anything to write home about , either . The people in the theater where I saw it ( I saw it on the preview night , August 25 ), were laughing at all the wrong . I  m pretty sure we  t supposed to be laughing during the prosecutor  s opening , or when the defendant was seeing a horrific demon ; but as I said , the acting was extremely novice . I am a high school teacher and I saw some of my there . One of them said she fell asleep and the other one said that she and her thought about leaving before the ending , but  t because her would have made her go to bed early ! I  seen  s with better and more bang for your buck . DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE ( especially if you are a horror movie fan !)",0
"I had never even of the show Firefly when my friend dragged me along to the - screening of this film . I had no idea what to expect . All she said was that it had something to do with space and that it was - fi . While I watched the film , I found myself so attached to the that everything that to them actually to me . - fi and action often rely on the adventure aspect to carry it but Serenity actually had me loving the people in it . I more when I got out of that theater . I was amazed by the wit and very happy with the plot ( that more than a couple that you won  t be ). I was hooked and I  t stop thinking about it . Since then , I  watched the entire series and all of it , but in the end , I think Serenity leaves it in the dust .",1
"I don  t mind mindless , escapist entertainment ... in fact , that  s why I rented this . seen the original , I knew this  t be that great of a movie , but I was counting on the action to pull me through . Well , apart from the beginning of the movie , : State of the Union was a huge let down from even my small . I guess the budget  t high enough for cool , exciting action so they substituted old - school 80s style for most of it , and suffice to say , there  s a reason why most action don  t do that stuff -- it  s boring . And since the action are the only reason to watch something like this , and they suck , there  s no real reason to give this movie even a moment  s consideration . The plot Stone ( Ice Cube ) Diesel  s character as the new , and trying to foil a plot against the President of the United . proceeds to throw people around , impress the ladies , blow stuff up . The basic concept is a hip - hop Bond , and while it like a cool concept that you  t possibly mess up , no , these it up ... its not Ice Cube  s fault , he  s no actor but I  seen him do better than this if the movie a script and some direction .",1

All the are fantastic , and i thought those weird were very frightening , plus is simply amazing in this !. This is my 2nd after 1st seeing it in , it frightened me to death , and i to panic , upon 2nd it  t quite as scary , however it still the crap out of me , and i found the score pretty creepy as well , plus i thought and had very good chemistry together . The plot is hard to follow at times , as your wondering what the hell is going on , however it itself pretty good at the end in my opinion , plus the people who are calling this funny , are absolutely up in the head . It on a lot of jump , and boy do they ever work , and i thought the effects were great , plus the ending was awesome !, and way for a sequel , and one of my favorite is when  s character under the sheet , and a surprise waiting for her .

The are what make this movie brilliant and the casting of Morgan Freeman as Red and as was spot on .

This movie some of the facing us in the modern age , even though the film was set over a period from the 1940  s \u0096 1980  s . Frank produced an excellent movie which does not disappoint in any way . I would recommend  The Redemption  to anyone over the age of about 15 as a brilliant and enlightening drama .",1

In the last five of of his life , gifted him a video camera , so that he could properly document his . After  s death in 2003 , reconstructed the of those , a wonderful character study of the man . had hoped that the footage would be used to show the that grizzly face -- namely human encroachment , starvation , and . Instead , us the inner of a man sitting outside the circle of human civilization . The self - destruction and anger that tortured been countless times in literature and film . To see it in documentary form -- as it is in Grizzly Man -- one the most powerful and accurate representation of the life and mind of a true eccentric . is that representation , from the first frame to last .

On location , with camera in tow , Timothy and were savagely and eaten by a large animal ( I won  t say what kind of animal , but careful should be able to deduce from the given above ). It is  s choice not to let us hear the grizzly ( hah !) incident . Instead , we must assume from the of a coroner , as well as himself , that what was truly horrific . On message , there been discussion regarding hearing the . The general consensus is that hearing the would show how truly stupid  s were .

One only needs to hear the of the at the Grizzly Bear Museum on Island . lived side - by - side with the for , the have a very sensible philosophy towards the furry . Stay away from them , and keep them away from you . Because Timothy did not follow this simple rule , the consider his to be disrespectful .

The problem is , it  s a formulaic scare tactic which often the case in massive plot , and stupidity just to accomplish . This movie is no exception . We  seen it before ; in , and Cabin Fever , and of other . Not to mention a film with this thin a plot , and no real , will always fail because in such tight talent , and it was obvious Hunt  t have any . I don  t know about you but I hate watching a 100 minute film where I can only see what  s going on for half the film . The creature was a of Alien , but that to be an epidemic in the new millennium . Boll fever . This movie was a lot of , good is not one of them . Carrying from Pitch Black , Deep Blue Sea , and , i was to halfway through . Cole should know by now how to choose a role , but it  s obvious he  t looking for any .  t even worth seeing .",1

I it was just mean - spirited and artistically deficient on every possible level . The acting was embarrassingly bad ( kudos to for to play the exact same character in  Matrix ,  Brotherhood of the Wolf  and now this disaster ), the were so terrible that most of the dialogue was impossible to understand . The was so jumpy , I felt sick . The cinematography and were just horrible . What was Terry thinking when he shot scene after scene of the moving , the running through of , and more ? Last but not least , for those who think animal cruelty is cool or humorous on any level , ever , should be ashamed of themselves . Thank God I  t bring .

"I  admit that if I am not sure about a movie , I will exhaust as many as possible to  influence  my of that movie . This is my first comment and it is sparked by the unbelievable amount of bad this movie received on this by . This movie was actually pretty good ; good story ; good acting ; great cinematography . The movie definitely my interest the entire 1 hour and 50 min . run time . THIS MAY CONTAIN ! The movie around Oh Dae - , a man for 15 ( no of torture ) and then . He a waitress , Mi - do and together their adventure . Oh Dae - to track down his and eventually him . The movie is easy to follow and understand ; it all rather well by voice - over and so their is no confusion as to what is going on . It is discovered less than halfway who the captor is and later on he why he Oh Dae - . There was definitely some brainwashing and mind control going on while Oh Dae - is , but it is . The movie is not that bloody or gory at all - most of it is and not shown on screen . The worst scene for me is at the beginning when Oh Dae - goes for and Mi - do and her for something  live  to eat . I definitely recommend this movie as it received an unjust amount of bad . 8 out of 10 !",0

All in all , the film was a complete mess , and its saving grace , to my surprise , ended up being Heath Ledger with a remarkable performance akin to that of  s work , as you can  t help but be by his each and every move . was perfectly fine , but the other from trying to use them his way , with his amusing over acting , but the studio him at certain , giving for uneven , and cringe worthy .

"I  m ashamed to say that this was one of those that I   t get around to  seeing in the cinema and somehow there was  always something else  to rent in Blockbuster a few later . I really should be ashamed . The film is stunning , it effortlessly what it REALLY like to be away from home , lost and lonely . The use of music and sound ( or lack of it !) are of genius and the and stunning - Bill with depth ? who  d have thought it and Scarlet to be the find of the decade . The use of of the public as unknowing is a well tried trick to add realism into a film and seldom works , but here it to the whole mood of the film perfectly giving it the secret ingredient - totally believable and . Bittersweet in its plot , it kept me of Last Encounter ( silly as it ) and of spoiling it all with a sickly sweet   ending were thankfully unfounded . It  s one of those rare that you don  t watch as much as let wash over you - never quite understanding what it so good or enjoyable . And yes , it the true test of a classic film - the fact that you  re still thinking of it days and afterwards . This really will go down as a classic and a reminder that Film as an Art form works best when people are its central focus and are to act . The only disappointing thing is the ( long ) wait for the next good one to come along ....",1
"People who go into a movie wanting to know exactly what to expect hate this film . Sometimes it is hard to tell the from the , and you have to pay attention to understand what is going on .

"It  s a crying shame that this outstanding movie  s rating been dragged down by small people who hate it because it was successful . You should be ashamed of yourselves . When I first saw it I thought it was the perfect movie , and it  s still one of my 8 later . It  s got sexual tension , action , social commentary , and the acting  t suck . It  s even got Bill , one of my top 10 criteria for a great movie . What  s so horrible about it that it an aggregate 6 . 9 ? The only reason I can think of is this perverse habit people have of anything that so much money or is otherwise successful that it them doubt their own worth .

"I have yet to see this film but I would like to comment on the first - release poster I saw on a huge billboard . The image was very minimal and stark . A black background with a horizontal side - view of a shiny , scuffed machete blade . The only text being a very amateur looking  Hotel  in gold Times New font . Why was this image so powerful ? Firstly I could see no as to what this poster was advertising , apart from the title obviously but the image itself  t look like other movie , there was something nonconformist and more real about it . No , no - just a stark , quite unsettling image of a weapon designed to cause a lot of damage . As much as the poster shook and to some extent me because of it  s originality , I thought it was tad insensitive but perhaps that is good for who know so little about what . A few days later I could no longer see the original poster , it had been with a more acceptable style image , still the machete blade only with sad of the central inside it . That kind of my curiosity a bit but nevertheless I  be this out when I have some money . Oh and I rated it 8 to be polite as I haven  t seen it yet !",1

This movie was bad on almost every level . Maybe every level . It was shot in a cinema verite way that was trying to be artistic but only in being annoying . It was long , boring and had such a fizzle of a payoff that I would have felt if I  t given up hope for this mess long before the ending . The message part of the movie was on with a trowel and akin to those World Help that you see on on . The movie handled it  s delivery so poorly that I was on the side of the evil drug and beginning to think that maybe a point .

".. still , this poor creature was a waste of that time . Clearly first - time director Hunt continuity as a relative concept -- as in relatively nonexistent . The basic premise -- escape from bloodthirsty in the dark wet underground -- could be scary in the right , but these are not those . The underwater action is disjointed and poorly , the viewer into filling in the ; the ( all attractive ) connect with neither each other nor the audience , and the sole entertainment becomes a matter of guessing who will meet a demise next ; after a while , the sight of yet another crew member being dragged first into an impossibly small opening nothing but .

"Here  s my capsule review of  The Constant Gardener   The Identity Goes to and Leaves Behind All the Chase / Fight and A - Level  I went to this movie based on its 78 % rating ( :// . . / m / constant_gardener /) and quickly that it was a combination of political and - at the expense of entertainment . If you  re still interested in watching this movie , be : It is not a  thriller  by any . It  s definitely  caliber  but that  t make it good . It  s pretty much your standard evil - corporation conspiracy movie , except the took care to calibrate it perfectly in the of the Academy and strip away anything that might distract the Academy like action or comedy or plot exposition . You could almost see the going through the head : 1 ) . Can  t have those vulgar messing up our . people sound than the rest of us , which off on your movie . 2 ) Relevant news issue   for our consumption . ( See The Interpreter ). Who needs an ad campaign or when you  got stuff happening in the real world 3 ) Complete Absence of Action or Comedy . - winning transcend entertainment . 4 ) and Crazy Camera . Motion sickness good . 5 ) Obligatory Anti - Bush Screed . In the first 20 of the film . Remember , the war in is bad and the UN is good . THE WAR IN WAS WRONG AND THE UN IS GOOD . END OF STORY . could have made a thriller with emotion - did it with Supremacy and Liman did it with . And . Smith . Instead , he chose to push the  Liberal Guilt  button until it broke . How many more do we need to see about evil white people non - white for their own benefit ?  t this been done before ? Why does it take 2 and 10 of our time for us to uncover what is clear as day ? We all know who the bad guy is . There  s no mystery after the first 30 of the film . After that , I found myself looking at my watch . I that too much time had gone by without anything to break the monotony , which is a VERY BAD THING in a movie that is billed as a  thriller . There  s nothing thrilling about a movie that no action . It  s even less thrilling to endure 2 and 10 of plot being advanced slowly and lugubriously by people talking . I don  t pay $ 9 . 00 to watch people talking to one another . I can get that at home for free . I pay for spectacle and I was getting a travelogue by people I  t particularly care for because they  t do anything at all ! I haven  t even touched on the lack of realism in this film . Basically it  s about an evil drug company that  s somehow got the Government on its side , leaving dead all over . Probably the most offensive part about  story is that it and intelligence as one - dimensional omniscient / omnipotent . Here  s news for you , chump - You are not Rev . Pat . people is harder than it on Mission : Impossible . Naturally all the people important to the plot survive , despite the apparent ease which the villain its . In fact , the hero by who rough him up as some sort of warning to keep his mouth shut , despite the obvious conflict between leaving someone alive and them to be quiet . Bottom line : I would be pleasantly if a portion of this film  s went to a good cause , because only a true executive can appropriate a  good cause  in the name of his .",0
"Contrary to what I  been led to believe ,  The  is actually not bad . It  s not a really great movie , not one of those that cast a spell on you , but it  s fun . Don  t expect anything but the basic amusement , and you  enjoy it . and Heath Ledger play their main well , although I found myself slightly by them in certain of the movie . Again , though , they their very well . The supporting cast does an equally wonderful job . There are some pointless in the movie , little that are pretty but have little connection with the outcome . Still , the idea of the script is a good one - it  s a light , fluffy that one to believing there is more . Trust me , there  t . The is eerily familiar , the of well - known nursery into frightening . There is no excessive use of computer graphics , which I take as a good thing . The are well into the time period , although I hardly thing could afford to keep up such white teeth . The me a little , from the to the  German  . But those are little obnoxious - nothing to worry about . Just sit back , turn off your brain , and relax . Two out of five .",0
"This movie is almost too horrible for , but for the sake of you , the horror movie goer , I will issue a strict warning : THIS MOVIE ASS ! Just got out of the , and I  t wait for the end . And let  s talk about the ending . No , I won  t give it away but let  s just say , this movie from a mediocre adventure / fi / fantasy film  Reign of . Now while I , for a just movie to steal so unabashedly from it , is just lame , cheesy , and stupid ... I mean , god , I get angry when borrow from  Alien  or   because those are incredible . But come on ,  Reign of Fire ? The was terrible , the script asinine , and the acting pathetic . The visual effects while pretty good , as usual , cannot save a film this bad .

"Rather than offering the same review that most people simply skim through , I am going to evaluate the movie based on several . Each category will be given a grade ( A F ) accordingly . : : ( City of God ) in - worthy fashion . Without giving anything away , the structure of this movie is incredible . Cinematography : : and combine a thrilling adventure with one of the most phenomenal of cinematography I  ever seen . Plot : B + why : while the first 3 / 4 of the movie are exhilarating as any , the last twenty - five or so of the movie  t keep up the high suspense . Script : B + why : the film place in and and the script , and very well at that . Acting : : Ralph is obvious the new . a stellar performance and SHOULD be a top candidate for Best Actor in 2006 . However , stole the show . I was amazed are her ability to maintain the emotion and power throughout . Wow . : : was on par with and cinematography - maybe even above it . The and - of was AMAZING and among the top 10 I  ever seen . Music : A - why : the original score fit the movie . not much else to say about that . Overall Grade : Aa touching , exciting film shot with such beautiful creativity that it  d be a shame if people it . it  s like this that will be remember through time , not the horrid garbage the public their $ 10 per ticket on . SEE THIS MOVIE , YOU WILL ENJOY IT .",1
"This film , although true to typical thriller , does accomplish a few good . By far the best thing about this film is the feeling of claustrophobia it upon the viewer . All of the tight and underwater really made me feel ill at ease , which is a mark that a horror film is doing its job . For those of you who have seen the original Alien , it  s a bit like that ..... only in an underwater cave . ( The even share physical ... from what you see of them ... with  s space ). The film also tension in that the subject matter is a bit foreign , i . e . cave exploration . The wander around in an enormous underground maze , and unlike most horror , you really can  t think of an obvious solution . It  s not a film where the stare blindly at an blatant remedy for their situation , and finally find it at the last second . The viewer just as lost as some of the ( which , I will admit , becomes borderline annoying after a while ) and thus , a good level of tension is . Another neat little underlying device the film is the feeling of constantly being . Sound is a big part of this , in that the creepy , cricket - like chirping of the the viewer throughout the entire film . A lot of the camera work ( especially in the underwater ) to this effect . While the film  s use of these is borderline brilliant , the rest of the movie is laughable . A hole - filled plot paired with disposable , static and unconvincing acting make the film another forgettable horror flick . The most thing of all is that the are never fully shown . They are visible mostly in brief . In the rare when their entire make it on - screen , they are moving so fast that one still cannot get a good feel for what they would look like . I for that one big long shot where the hero down the monster , and it never came . Big disappointment here , and it made the film feel cheap . I  d say it  s worth seeing in the theater , since it  s only good won  t be done justice on your television ( unless of course , you have a really nice home entertainment center ). It  s an entertaining film , and I do not regret going to see it . It  s not one I would see again , however .",1
"Serenity is based on the very short - lived series Firefly . So short - lived that the final from the first and only season are only available on . I don  t know why the show was not a success . The movie is awesome . It is like the Old West Star . .  Mal  ( ) a pseudo Robin Hood and a band of  space . Mostly comprised of former , Serenity  s ( the ship  s ) crew fought the Alliance for the outer - rim during the war . A war they lost . Now , this crew the Alliance government at times to keep their ship running , but mostly to stay free . But when they uncover a very dark secret of the Alliance , they have something new to fight for . I never saw the original show , but this movie me want to go buy the . It a lot of action and , from of the show , it up well with the series . I think most are really going to love this movie .",1
"The Exorcism of Rose is based upon a true story , the that lead up to the death of Rose . Rose ( Carpenter ) was a young college student , who she was possessed . Her family and her pastor did everything they could to save her . This was not your typical horror flick . Though there are some scary throughout , this story is more about Rose and her story . A story that her pastor , Father ( ), desperately to tell during his trial . ( Laura ),  s attorney , to defend whom she is a good man . This movie you without confirming Rose  s possession . Despite the horror angle , this movie is also about self - sacrifice , love and loyalty . I think horror movie might be disappointed with this , however , I thought it was really good . A scary movie with a good plot and a good message .",1
"A marvelously film that to remind us that there is more to that great continent of than we tend to imagine , and this film ( and the book it was based on ) as a pointed critique of how we ( the wealthy of the world ) see and treat those of whom we know and care so little . But much of the intrigue is in the cloak and dagger narrative and the political it and to . What made this a superior film was how these were deftly handled and compellingly by a top notch cast and careful direction making large intimately meaningful so that you come away with lots to talk about , and about something you can seek to change . Sprawling just to say : great film , great cast . and have great chemistry .  s rant when  and her character first meet was brilliant .",0
"You either love it or you hate it , but one thing is for sure ; it  s not going to be easy to forget . Screenwriter , not only , with the help of , taken his though a well structured yet completely - maze of the inner of the human psyche but to place the two main ( and ) at the core of a classic yet re - screwball relationship scenario . What is very interesting and thought provoking about this film is how they the journey of the mind as it through  s , not only him to see as they were , but being able to place himself inside these and interact with the people they contain . This idea us with a very accurate interpretation with the same helplessness we feel when trapped in a bad nightmare . It is through like these the once music video director can strut his stuff , providing us with a very stylistic representation of , whether it be the disintegration of his childhood home or the through distant which in some him in bed in the middle of the beach where he first met . We join as he through to which should be and even apart . But it works ! Even though  s represent a surprisingly path the movie is very fluid and testament to  s ability to superbly compliment  s vision . The relationship in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind true to the screwball romantic comedy where after a series of absurdly blessed of beautiful surrealism the may live happily ever after in their own clumsy way . We affectionately embrace the age old philosophy that it is better to have and lost than to have never at all . The film given us a unique approach to the human psyche and us to observe the value of our and how we choose to articulate them . If you were to erase your , Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a keeper .",0
"The Cave  was disappointing in that it was never mildly entertaining as last summer  s similar   was . It was never clear to me exactly what the group was doing in the cave . The film was shot in a very dreary manner and the endless of the group diving , running and with each other are never interesting , and quickly become annoying . The film  s lead Cole even more than he did in  , and no charisma whatsoever . The only actor that credible was an athletic Piper , who did good in a climbing scene . Other than that there is little to recommend here . This can take its place next to  Alone In The Dark  as the worst movie of 2005 so far .",1
"Timothy to LA on the hope of becoming a star , but got  eaten alive  by the decision in the entertainment industry . He then went to to make what to him figuratively in LA a horrible reality by taunting until one finally took his bait and him . The only were that it took 3 to accomplish his dance , and that he tragically took someone ( an innocent woman ) with him . Ironically , in his death , director came along and made him a posthumous star in what is a most compelling movie about man  s relationship to nature . not as a sympathetic environmentalist , but as a narcissistic , compulsive , and mentally hell - bent on self - destruction . Not that he  t sympathetic ; he is . But he is so obviously wrong that one cannot leave the theater thinking he got what he deserved . Imagine a common housefly with a microscopic video camera flying around someone  s house , to be at one with the , its for the other . The fly all around the , showing how the won  t hurt it so long as it  t give its ground . When one of the to shoo the fly away , it the human it it .

"The review by I think this structure and intent best . look for ( ) who have a reason for being , an intent , a location and a resolution . On the other hand , the believe in a more basic animism . The spirit is independent of the person who and as the embodiment of an emotion - in this case rage . The and the atmosphere in which they are revealed is done excellently - but there is no motivation or resolution . They are rage . They are not limited to a location , but can manifest anywhere where the happen to be . Supposedly , they pass their rage on to their . Their then die and new rage are born . The , at least in this movie , are not or . They continue to exist and continue to kill . Most of this is not in The Grudge . You either know the culture or you do not . From what I was reading I guess this rage was on to most who saw this movie . Watching The Grudge I felt like I was on the verge of really liking this movie , but was the necessary understanding to do so - a strange feeling . Anyway , this is worth a watch on cable or .",1
"The tag line it all .  There are man was never meant to go . and this movie is one of them . This is the latest in what must be the new refuge of the talentless director and cinematographer . When they don  t have the or the for graphic depiction , ... they simply shake the camera . This brilliant advancement a number of , not the least of which are amateurish action , and unimaginative that look like from Ate . Enough already , at least hire a camera person who  t going through . The are presentable and do reasonably well with the insipid material . Some of the cave are worth a look , but not worth the price of sitting through this formulaic monster version of Got Wet .",1
"I should point out that I am not as much affected as other people . It is pointing out a loneliness of a famous celebrity who millions , but  t have love and care in his life .

The acting is good while I feel uneasy with some . was one of them . She had of neglect with her husband and she had her to return back to home . Why Bill to stay there ? Go back with him . It as she needs a good , friend , but she also to be where her husband is . Thats not so logical to me . The of been quite sharply pictured in the movie . That is good , but not the real thing I was looking around in this movie . The reason why I really  t get all along with the movie is I am an easy person . I really don  t know , but generally a good movie that one can watch and won  t bother watching again unless you go to .",1
"Here  s some neat about the movie , which had some exterior of my in ( where  s it  s based out of ). - The police and badge style of the officer in the go - cart scene were authentic ( except the 8 point hat ). The large patch on the police car the real police patch , but the design of the police car did not match  s ( black and white  s ). - The taxi in the beginning of the movie made a left turn onto North Avenue against the lane ( after passing under the Transit Bridge ). that  t make it into the  goof  s  area . Overall , I really  t believe that Mac  s character  t like  s character . He  t cold enough . was trying to be funny , and their on - screen interaction  t distant enough .  s just the same character throughout each movie he  s in . But , at least they  re two big for this remake .",1

I don  t cheer in , I did in Serenity . This what was an incredible television series , and it and it so well . Not every subplot was taken care of , but that  t matter , there was this incredible sense of closure . Great plot , incredible , and not a boring bit the whole way through . Hopefully this movie will do well and the 2 will go ahead . The only reason I don  t give this 10 out of 10 is that I believe something can always be better , I just can  t think of how right now . Watch the series , then see this movie you will be .",1

"** Spoiler ** ** Spoiler alert ** I was really upset by certain of this film . so , Joss had something to say , and part of what he is about is unexpectedness and killing off important is part of that whole process . But come on , what a huge mistake he made with the main person who been off in this film . What was Joss thinking ? he actually thought out what this ? Everyone else on this site is talking about how huge this will be and how everyone will go for this film and there will be , . Well I now go on record to say that , in my opinion , he probably blown his of a sequel . It just no sense in what he done . He the heart of his series , the one person who brought the   type of humanity to the show . It is really inexplicable as to how he could have done this , how the and have been to be by the death of one special character . The film for me then becomes by this death . I know life is something that cannot be taken for and that unexpected do happen , but the inconsistency in the manner of the death of this character , and the fact that this character in that particular place as well , does not seem possible . I that it is too late to do this , but I cannot understand why you are this version run when it is so inconsistent and unbelievable , as well as just plain ridiculous . I would firmly suggest alternate on the which will inevitably come out and which my family will buy . We are not totally unhappy with this film , in fact it was otherwise really well done , and we the script in the main . Well Joss you have obviously to shock and you have in that . But I am very disappointed and . The have stood by you to great effect , so why have you taken away the best character in the whole series ? If there is any way to do a or to bring this character back , I would strongly suggest doing just that if you are able to get another film or series off the ground which I do honestly doubt now . Thanks for all the effort you have put in though , and for giving the a chance to reprise their on the big screen , which they have done to very great effect .",0
"Not sure where to even begin , there are so many negative and that I find completely off base . I this movie , my wife and I went in with little expectation , we were pleasantly . Those who say the action too long to begin are action who care nothing for any attempt for characterization or story . We found the movie was well paced and thought out . Were there dark ? Yes , they  re in a cave and under water . The story is a solid horror ( me a bit of  The Relic  but in a cave :) - this move nothing to do with Alien , or Hell ... I  m not sure how some actually get for their ? As Cole does a good job , as did the rest of the cast . Those who the so - lack of char development ... what do want ? This is not a drama . You get just enough to flush out the story . I thought the were well done ( though I have to admit the film would of been better off with the freedom of an R rating ) the of the - 13 was a bit tight . But effective . And I have to say ... I the ending ! Was unexpected and I do hope more people ignore the and get out and see this movie . I look forward to the next movie . ( as well as an un - cut . Cut !!! perhaps :) A side note ... I feel that the majority who have seen this film and made  t understand or catch the point of  where  the came from . That knowledge ( ) the story make more sense and enjoyable . Especially the ending :) So if you like suspense , horror , - science , action this is a good solid  B  movie ! Much more entertaining and rewarding than The ( which I  really  to like ) but that  s another review : )",1
"Thanks to the magic of I got to become a late Firefly fan and now can  t wait for the movie . I  m sending the set to all my family and in that they too get hooked and that movie does well and so there are and also the series comes back . Go Serenity go ! If you are just browsing this page and have not seen the show order the now . But you should promise yourself that you will only watch one a day ! No sitting down and thinking you  just watch one and getting up very much later a little bug - eyed but deeply as you you  watched them all and that now that you  re an addict - there are no more .",1

"I am really quite happy that I went and saw this movie because it was really good ! There was a good story line , and they made a good choice on choosing the people that they did for this movie . The Cave is a good horror movie because the tried a new spot , an underwater cave , as the main set . In the Alien Legacy the were in outer space , in the Abyss they were an underwater colony near the ocean floor at several thousand . The cave was a first in the alien underground , but water . The best thing I about this movie was that the leader of the group by one of these giant bat - like and to mutate into one of them . The ending also at a sequel , and I hope that the rise up to the challenge and make a sequel !",0
"This movie is brutal . If you don  t like or can  t take brutal violence , don  t watch it - it  s not for you . That being said , it  s much more than that . If you go into this movie not much , you  appreciate it far more . By the way - do not watch this movie with the on - the are much closer to the actual translation . The climax of this movie had me wide - mouthed and all I could say was  no f *** ing way  over and over again in disbelief . You must see this movie . If you hate , you hate it - but I  never seen anything like it . I still get thinking about it . The actor that O Dae ( forgive the spelling ), was amazing - and so was the soft - spoken villain . The direction was beautiful . This is a classic .",0
"I really the original , The Ring , but this sequel was such a crushing disappointment . So many great , , Sissy , Cole , ., but what a waste of talent and energy . of cheap , , and but pointless special effects . Frightening dissolve as awaken to find it was just a nightmare . And how exactly did evil Samara suddenly acquire the power of demonic possession ? I thought this was The Ring , not The Exorcist . An extra on the , a 15 - minute encapsulation of what might have in the before the sequel , is better than the movie itself . Sometimes I just don  t understand the that film make .",1
"I the Firefly series and gradually a fan . This fact may have clouded my vision somewhat but I have tried to be as concise and objective as possible , so straight in ... The start of the film is very cleverly worked . Many are in several different , with each inadvertently the next until you are faced with a rough idea of what the situation is . A couple of are involved here so you get the general gist . I can imagine many people unfamiliar with the Firefly series prematurely presuming lead character from the offset , but you soon that this is a film for all the . As the film to progress \u2013 at first with a reasonably light witty tone \u2013 you can see how each member of the crew their position aboard the space ship Serenity . I felt this part of the film was extremely well written , with a good balance of dialogue for all of the and a buoyant rhythm . The witty slowly give way to minor conflict and the generally amiable crew begin to show sides of their that were not revealed during the Firefly series . This the door for in character that affect the course of and how are made , providing a little more believability when do make \u2013 once again , excellent writing . The film score typically classical ambient music with tinged folk guitar . It should age well and not inadvertently date the film as so many Nu - Metal of this era and genre surely will . This musical mixture works well and with mood setting \u2013 as it obviously should \u2013 especially in the final third of the film . When the action up and the story becomes clear , a few good emotional and turns really capture your attention . This part of the film will definitely appeal more to Firefly . Anyone else , with less of a interest in the may not get as much out of these . This , I fear will be the case for quite a few of the   during the film , that to one may appear inspired , but to another just a tool for plot progression . As the film toward the climax you are given a real sense of apprehension and you are truly unsure about what will happen \u2013 both to the and to the of the story . The end of the film is totally believable and logical while still realism , faithfulness to and an action finale . All this is wrapped up nicely , leaving many \u2013 all of which positive . This is a warm , complex , yet effortlessly story about good and evil ( where good and evil are not so clearly defined ). It is a film where \u2013 if told from different and following different \u2013 you would have a completely different opinion about which are good and which are evil . I really like how this is done . The writer done a sterling job of raising a few moral and he the grey of human morality and it quite refreshing . This is truly a good film in many ways . The humour may begin to tire the dry and more cynical among us , and the overall premise , and story may seem slightly to , but these are I have to find , and don  t personally agree with . Seriously , go and see it",1
"THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN . MASSIVE , MOVIE . DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE . From the most recent of this movie , it that quite a bit of people , instead of paying attention , chose to make a knee jerk reaction to praise they felt was unwarranted , but which was in actuality completely and totally warranted . I just watched Straw Dogs , a highly revenge movie from the 70s , and I felt was equally comparable in quality and just as strong in story and behind plot . For example , some have stated that Lee Woo -  t have enough motivation to want to destroy Oh Dae -  s life . He did . Lee Woo - lost his lover , his sibling , and what can only be assumed to be his - , and all because of Oh Dae -  s glib tongue . Oh Dae - this at the end , which is why he his own tongue and why he himself to save Mi - do . He that he was in the wrong in that instance , and his lack of discretion irreparably ruined the life of a classmate . Perhaps , due to your on incest , you believe his life was ruined justly . That is one way to see it , and one I agree with . But even though Lee Woo - was morally reprehensible and a disgusting individual , he would still have and , which led him to treat Oh Dae - as he did . He  t just want to hurt Oh Dae - , he to ruin his life and leave him helpless while he ruined it . Some have on the hypnosis factor of the movie as unrealistic . To that I say ... so what ? When you watch a movie , you suspend your disbelief . The best picture winner of last year , Million Dollar Baby , completely botched their treatment of intensive care and was extremely unrealistic . It was still highly with praise by many movie . many times get technical wrong . If a movie where a man himself to be able to fight and then down about 20 people all by himself you because the hypnosis factor was a bit unrealistic , then you have some extremely bizarre of view . was a beautifully shot , wonderfully , and carefully plotted movie . Plot ? Almost none . For such a complex plot , that is quite an achievement . Was it hard to follow ? A little ... but then again , most people are incapable of following a movie that does not hand them the story in easily digestible , so that  s not a problem , it is actually a plus . Maybe some  t find it had enough action . Maybe were disturbed by the inclusion of incest . Maybe just to be different from professional . Whatever the case , was a fantastic movie . One of the revenge ever .",0
"I challenge you to find a cooler movie alien / monster . I mean , come on ... ? I don  t think so . King ? Dude , be real . I will waive my judgment until after I see Peter  s version coming out soon . The concept of the Predator is simply amazing ... if you like - fi ... like I do . Without spoiling anything , the and ... are you sitting down ... well , they fight !! This is a great special effects movie , and one that  t really flesh out the human . This is the kind of crap most people complain about . If I go to a movie Alien . Predator , are very high that I am watching the human to see the interesting ways that the Predator will dispose of them . That being said , the guide , an actress who I have never of , actually does a good job in the film . She is the only human that does . Enough about . The are generally a grumpy crew , and the are looking to hunt . What is a scene almost as grisly as my plate , after eating a 16 . ... rare . If you like the , and want to see a cool action movie , this is a must - see . If you want a sappy movie that the human spirit , please never talk to me .",0

"hello this my first review for a film . i have tried to not spoil for you and write this critique of the structure of the film . this is my overall opinion of the film rather than pick apart certain and spoil other possible enjoyment of the film . just watched the cave and came out thinking that the writer / were lazy . they just came up with a premise then sat and watched other horror and saw a scene and it for quite a few . the ending is almost as clearly as in the sixth sense . the seem to be hybrid of other screen which them seem a little silly . with the plot line they they should have kept them simple they may have been more effective and scary . as a horror nut this film left me about the . but to put my to one side for a moment if you are not an avid horror fan you may like this film so i will not tell anyone to not watch it . at the end of the you may be left like thinking they could have done so much better with the film . p . s . if you have not watched it watch the descent after this .",1
"i saw this film and i it but i saw it again and i it i thought it was the worst film in the world . the action was cheesy and the acting was terrible . the story was good but could of had a better director . but one thing that got me really mad off was that they made the film pg13 . the alien and predator franchise been rated r . how the hell do u make it pg13 . i thought the movie could have been more like the video game . the the the . the thing i  t like was that the to quickly . and also the was lame . i give this movie 3 because the story was good but the acting , action and rating was very lame and  t really great .",0
"I first went to see this movie when i was eight old . Because i was young i did not get the concept of the movie , therefore i did not fall in love with the as i did when i got older . The are Jack ( ), a poor man who won two on Titanic by a luckily hand in poker . His friend , an man , him . During the trip Jack a woman Rose ( ), who was suicide . As a reward Rose  s , Cal , Jack to dinner along with them and the first class . During the next day , Rose to know this man who saved her , and she to love him , and not her . Towards the ending , when the ship is sinking , Rose must choose between her rich Cal , or the man she , Jack . Although this may seem as a sappy love story , it is still really about the  unsinkable  ship . Titanic , the ship and its been one of the most intriguing that I  ever studied . as the ship is sinking they only let and on to the first , but then they do not let out the people 3rd class , and you see a woman telling her a bedtime story , because she that there is just no hope of surviving . This movie will make your water , if the least . Its a long , but very good movie . i have seen it about 6 or 7 times and i still cry every time . done a great job on this movie . without the music , and the , this movie  t of been the same .",1
"This is the first movie I  seen . I don  t really know how to review a movie like that , since I feel I can  t judge it by the usual . Some of it were really sad and moving . sent up my spine . One scene specifically ( about Timothy  s watch ) was really . But my favorite thing about the movie I think was how usually left the camera rolling for a few after the finished what they had to say , just to capture those of silence and ( sometimes ) awkwardness , which felt really authentic . I think saw a lot of himself in Timothy  s tortured soul . Also , one of the most in the movie is where Timothy an intense fight between two .",1
"Excellent movie . Great play by the . This movie will be . It the constant and repetitive that the human kind does time after time . It it also a reminder that even if the world decided to not intervene in the conflict between the and the , this could happen everywhere . Hatred , bigotry , racism and territorial this conflict but the abandonment of this part of the world after an avid exploitation by the did not help either . Ultimately , the conflict in this movie the terrible of previous on a complete civilization .",1
"WARNING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I  t really know what i was going to get with this but as i usually do i see the film at the latest showing poss on a night . But 10mins into this film and i was wishing i  d stayed at home and watched a . The acting was terrible the was even worse . The cave magically enough was amazingly lit even though it was 1mile underground and most of the film was set more than 3miles away from the descent hole . The divers in the film had been diving with each other for but when some of the group was being and lost they  t really seem to care which just made the film seem even . This is my first movie comment so don  t know what else to say except this movie is really bad and you  t go see it . Thanks for reading",1
"My , family and I have so long to see a film like this made , I must thank every person involved in its production . If it does not take every major award at the , Golden , People  s Choice , and every other contest , I will completely give up on , because it will have to answer my needs . I go to the to escape , to learn something , and to be . This film accomplished all that , and so much more . I was so grateful my two sons , 14 and 16 went with us . Going to the with your is so   at those , but as we our popcorn and the root beer we knew we  t really afford , we learned so much about the reality of The Depression , the bond of family , the importance of integrity , and the we have always taught our about what is right and wrong , and why . Our daughter , , knew from a very early age that her calling in life was to become an actor , and we fought her tooth and nail , knowing how corrupt and evil people can become here in . After seeing this film , I came away of her decision to stay and fight to make great like Man . I finally see what she been trying to tell me for the past 15 -- how film can lift the human spirit , teach , and be a light to this war - torn world . proved it can be done , and I hope the next time he needs a convincing cast for a creative film , he  give my daughter a chance to audition for him . You  come a long way ,  , and when I see that Best Director in your hand , I will cry , but I will also pump the air with my fist , jubilate , and scream ,  Yes ! Your victory will feel like one for me , and one especially for my daughter . Long may you live , and direct and produce to your dying day , at the age of 129 , or so .",1
"I had high for this movie ... I thought Rob Zombie  s style of horror would translate well to a full length picture . I was , however , wrong . Zombie lost something when he to the big screen . He lost a sense of fun . There were a lot of good , or at least with potential , at making to some of the classic cult horror that Zombie used in his musical . But they just sort of on screen , like a flan in a cupboard . What was a mush of style camera , some , and some pretty brutal violence . The problem was that these never into any kind of whole , and after the first half hour or so , it got pretty damn boring . The rest of the film to meander with no particular direction , just a string of of sadism , with lame and cheesy camera . You can tell Zombie was trying , somewhere in there was a seed for a great tribute to horror . But Zombie just  t seem to have what it as a director to pull it together and make it work .",1

"does many right in this little  courtroom horror  picture . His possession are top notch , with most of the coming from jarring camera work and generally only subtle special effects . Rarely is a special effect in this film more than a digitally scary face or subtly enhanced human ability ( as often seen in The X - ). The rest is done through , lighting , and scoring . I believe that did this for a very specific reason - to add credibility to both sides of the courtroom argument . Was possessed by or mentally / physically ill ?  s of strength , obscene bodily , and other frightening can all be by both science and religion . For some of the more supernatural that , us observe from two : demonic influence and objective science . Since this is of course a horror picture , there are noticeably more of the former . This is a good thing because unfortunately does not handle drama very consistently in this picture . Several key in the film , a fervent assertion made by the district attorney , that should have with the audience instead made everyone in the theater laugh at the scene  s ridiculousness . Still , the are top notch ( particularly a long exorcism scene which like  s Exorcist but then some surprisingly different turns ) and both religious and scientific for the ( which was never an option for the head - spinning , ) will satisfy both and . Worth seeing .",0
"I had the opportunity to view an advance showing on , August 25th . I  t find one  dull  spot what - so - ever . There  s not much to say that  t spoil the ending , although the ending for the most part was slightly predictable . It  s what before ... the flash - , trial testimony , the suspense that  t predictable . I will most likely see this again once it the . I was not the only one in the theater to  jump out of my seat . Although only rated - 13 , I personally would not recommend by anyone under the age of 18 , due to the intensity and religious . And to know this was based on a true story is the most disturbing ... I  m still wondering if she was possessed , or was it actually epilepsy ?? Watch and make your own decision ... just be sure to keep a tight grip on your popcorn !",1
"I to make a comment pertaining to the movie since I was able to view a sneak preview last night . Without revealing too much I will just advise that the beginning had everyone on the edge of their , but eventually the movie switched focus from Rose to long drawn out courtroom that at times were very anti - climactic . Other than that , the film was quite good , not great , but not corny either . I also felt that the involved in the prosecution and defense of the priest who the exorcism on Rose were poorly written and were void of any depth . Although Laura gave a great performance . Even a brief appearance by a secret eyewitness which I thought would have lead to something exciting , was over just as fast as it . I was for more focus and background on Rose herself . The movie still  t half - bad , I recommend it when out on , but if you  re a fan of being out of your seat , watch the movie in the for the effects .",0
"One of the for  The Exorcism of Rose  is for the forthcoming 2005 remake of the Carpenter movie  The Fog . While that movie will no doubt provide a thrill or two , just watching it , you know it won  t be the same kind of level that the brilliant   . While that will have and  boo  and the usual , this movie right here is something intellectual , deliberately paced , and , ultimately , genuinely terrifying . While not revealing too much , the plot on the trial of a priest ( ), with the negligent death of young Rose ( a breakout performance from Carpenter ). Laura , in charge of his defense , while why he  s one of the most under - today with his venomous role as the district attorney . The priest and Rose  s family say she was possessed by a demon , while the prosecution she was epileptic and the priest , Father , ultimately lead her to her gory demise . This is where the movie turns convention on its head : the story is told almost entirely in . While one would think that this would weaken the story , it does not . As a matter of fact , Father  s testimony on the exorcism itself and it  s inherent are the most terrifying seen in for . In these , one cannot help but think back to its superior and obvious forbearer :  The Exorcist . Yet ,   is not a remake of it by any . As a matter of fact , for once you get to see what , which is really drawing from more of the oft -  movie   s Ladder  than anything else . In a rare event , the special effects never ONCE look fake , further to the sheer terror of the film . The score is brooding and a squeamish and uneasy mood ( especially during  s first   in her dorm ), and the script , for once , actually goes through religious symbolism analysis in compelling detail , not once ever down to the audience . This  t a non - stop terror thrill ride - it  s a smart one that when to play it safe , and when to scare your pants off . Given that , it should be noted that    t perfect . The script Father say  dark  and  dark  way too much , and a few might not like how it somewhat low - key ( though the climax is extraordinary ). Yet when you come down to it , you have a phenomenal horror movie . Hopefully it will ascend to the of modern - day , and people won  t write it off as derivative , because it  s not .   will make you think , sometimes laugh ( it when to place a good joke to break tension ), but ultimately scare you - no other film in recent memory done it better .",0
"( this review ) I just saw a screening of TEER . The movie is about the so possession and subsequent death of a college student during an exorcism . The priest that the exorcism is under trial for her death and we have a courtroom drama over the event . The first 2 / 3 of the movie was great and was building momentum only to slow down the last 1 / 3 . We don  t get much into how she possessed , why she was alone in her dorm at the time , or why she the devil in ... but there were some genuine scary especially when you thought she , Laura  s character and / or the priest were going to meet the devil . This suspense more then up for the slow courtroom ending . The film  t try to pass either way as to whether she was or  t possessed , leaving it up to the viewer . It never really whether  s character actually her client ( the Priest ) nor did it give much credible evidence to prove or disprove the event . The courtroom was where the movie down . This was a basic prosecution / defense debate with a very predictable ending . The ending was also very flat leaving a lot of unanswered . The devil was apparently after but somehow stopped ... The screening I did not have the priest say  no injection of the devil , nor was there any levitation ( that I read elsewhere ). There was also nothing about her body being to find a decomposed corpse which the catholic church said meant that she  t possessed ( since the possessed do not decompose ) There was no gory , bloody , graphic effects other then a twisting , stiff of her body at times . All in all an entertaining movie that does an job of suspense minus the courtroom drama . 6 . 5 out of 10",0
"though the acting was good , I was a bit disappointed the movie  t explore more of the family background . The supposed possession and exorcism were told in . I came away with the impression either side could glean evidence of mental illness or possession , depending on your . Whatever the case , it was tragic . I will add the actor could really scream up a storm . The movie was also pretty faithful to the actual trial from what I could see . I a preview last week and will probably see it again when it comes out . The restraint of the film was noted by me and my too , because it  t scare solely for the sake of sensation . The possibility of true possession does not interfere with the medical and vice - . All said , the movie for either belief system .",0
"EXPLORING NEW ... a review for The Cave / Screen 2005 Color 109 . Action - Horror Cole , Piper , , and Morris Chestnut star . Directed by Hunt Rated - 13 for language , violence and gore *** 1 / 2 ( out of 5 ) First time Hunt who was the second unit director on the Matrix a valiant effort with the action horror spectacle The Cave . Brimming with classic suspense , an interesting story with a few unpredictable , decent , beautiful and set design ( I  m talking worthy ) and taut direction this monster mayhem fest to reach new and be a cut above the rest . Sexy as Hell Cole ( 2 fast 2 furious , ) the cast of expert cave diving which include feisty and surprising Piper ( Coyote Ugly ), drool worthy ( Third Watch ), whiny ( Gossip ) and Morris Chestnut ( ). The film off thirty ago ago as a group of decide to explore a cave with a mythical history lying under a church . They are never from again . 30 later the crew is brought together to explore the cavern . Soon after a tragic accident horrific leave them together underground . Instead of still and their doom they decide to explore the and try and find another way out before there run out . But something them in the dark . Something monstrous , something hungry . The film is a fairly standard horror pic reminiscent of other underwater such as and Deep star six . Although it never those entertaining it does manage to go in a completely opposite direction and explore new of originality . Ultimately just a rip of Alien . Hunt the film fairly slow trying desperately to build the and their . He somewhat but the film really  t grab your interest in any way . Besides the apparent eye candy the film is terribly sluggish in it  s first half . Than something interesting the action up , we care about the and there  s suddenly a truckload of suspense thats unleashed . Boiling over with exciting action and interesting plot the film to become one hell of an edge of your seat nail biter . On a technical level the film is beautifully . The underwater as well as the cave  s set design is absolutely extraordinary and breath taking . Mixed with a bundle of structured colors and film the film itself as a mosaic work of art . Hunt does well with his first outing but leaves room for much improvement some of his and directorial seem slightly in pace , believability and continuity . However in a film like this in logic are to be and to fully enjoy this film and all it to offer you just need to let yourself go . Also credit must be given for a film of it  s subject matter to be straight forward with hardly any humor . So that we can take the film as seriously and realistically as possible . The only real problem the film is the and unnecessary conclusion a and unbelievable twist . All in all a positive victory for all involved and a welcome addition to it  s genre .",1
"Most of the that you will see about this film will refer to it as this year  s List , and in many ways it is . But to just apply a label like that to Hotel is to do the film an injustice . Whilst both are similar in plot and inspired by the heroic of real men , they should both be as a film on their own . For Hotel is a much more intimate affair than List as it on and his family . Most of the action in this film is confined to one locale , which to the feeling of isolation from the outside world . And therein the major between the 2 and the they depict . The holocaust in the 2nd World War was easy for the rest of the world to overlook ( I know it terrible but remember at the time there was no , no 24 hour news coverage , no , the true enormity of this horrific slaughter only came to light after the event . In , the outside world just  t care , and if the truth is known , we still don  t . We live in a world where a news story can be instantly , and yet we still choose to ignore the of a country like . We go to war over fictitious of of mass destruction in the guise of a humanitarian mission , but where was our humanity in , or in or in any of the other where such as these happen on a daily basis . The that plague a place like exist in our own , our own , our own , our own , these are not just that are to . Racism and intolerance everywhere , they are just more extreme in some . This film the fact that these are real happening to real people . It to the countless statistics that are so easy to ignore , when a person a name and not just a number it it harder to distance ourselves from these . Yes this film is full of violent and horrific ( although it is never explicit it is mainly ), yes this film is unbearable tense in , yes it does make you angry and ashamed that our have sat by and done nothing ( Nick  s about is one of the most chilling in recent history ) But this film is ultimately uplifting , it is full of hope and it us once and again that one man can make a difference . Yes this is a message movie and it is based on true , but it is also funny , moving , tense and inspirational . The acting is first rate and you will end up thinking about the of what you have seen for days to come . In short it is a substantial cinematic achievement , absolutely stunning .",1
"Just finished watching  The Grudge  and unfortunately I  t find it to be particularly engaging . Perhaps it was the slow pace , or the lack of coherent plot . Unfortunately horror usually do lose me when people starting the ghost ( or spirit ) into dark alone -- I guess I  m too logical . It was beautifully and the music was a nice addition , but I found myself audibly sighing repeatedly during the movie ( luckily I was in my living room ). Probably because it like the same scene over and over again . Obviously there are people with a much bigger appreciation for this type of film than I do . If you are somebody who thought the Ring was fabulous then you  probably like this . If not , you might find this film a little tedious and repetitive .",1
"Interestingly , one of the with whom the High and the Mighty is most popular is aviation . The crew interaction , and the wild mood of the Captain - Stack - are tempered quite well by the - pilot by . Not surprisingly , considering the cast , the relief pilot and the flight engineer are deep in the background . The between the in times of stress are frequently by with their on to do , and not to do , during their crew resource management training . The High and the Mighty is now available on . It is about $ 14 on a popular mail order site . It is the model that subsequent aviation disaster strive to meet . Enjoy !",1
"Firefly from the little screen to the big one with minimal . Saw the - release in May that even was without all effects and music and it was still good . Because we watched the show , there were lots of extremely tense but the best part was that if someone  t seen the show , they  d be able to enjoy a romping space western too . The movie is consistent with it  s own story line and . There are several unexpected that leave you in your seat . The are what make this movie worth watching . As for myself .. well .. I  be there opening night to see the finished product . is used heavily as a marketing tool on this film and while he is his always excellent self , his part in the movie was smaller than originally .",1
"A shame that this great film was given a limited release and was for copy - catting  The Matrix . However , it since been to a much deserved cult status . The only real resemblance to  The Matrix  here are the trench - , and in that movie the only wear them at the end . Flashy gun have been around for a long , long time and so bullet . I can remember bullet back to the early 90s in  . So this film is an independent new idea in its own right . AND IT ! The , , and action all show talent and make this look like a huge big budget epic . The central idea of is well with Bale giving a very good performance . Also despite the lack of extensive some of the and action blow other right out of the water , most notably an awesome hallway battle towards the end . Each fight scene cool camera that make totally unnecessary and as a result the action and much more real . However , probably much more importantly , the story is among the most interesting in recent - fi . While some argue its originality this sure  t rip off any recent - fi movie and while the idea been dealt with before , the superior realization here is more than enough to see this film . So if your in for a good visionary action thriller watch this . You won  t be disappointed . I rate it 10 / 10 Rated R : intense violence",1
"hey , being a 35 y / o here , i thought this movie was amazing . i have seen millions of and this one the cake .. something about it just out at me and made me the 3 more times to watch it .. just so frig - gen awesome . . also , its crazy how when the creature comes to life and all the cave - men , i mean - on , how awesome is that !! . know what you think ? your ? it was just an amazing show ! . i think that if i have to keep random stuff to this just to make it 10 , I  m have to go rate another movie just like it .. go out and buy this movie as soon as it comes out ! you will not be disappointed i promise .. it is such a investment !",0

"based on the same story as the film made in the 70  s . At least the original  t take itself seriously and had a humorous touch . This is a typical female - in - danger film but with no . It just to the common denominator . Nothing is . It just to be an excuse to show more gore without any reason . My teenage it , which is probably who it  s at .

"Saw this film on not ever liking the look of it , i had seen many , , you name it on this film and it had never really been a film i had thought of going to see . Yet when my 6 year old sister to get the i had really no choice but to sit and watch what i though was going to be another childish film , with and around . And when the film what i thought were my worst were already starting . I mean that happy little elf really does give you the wrong idea , and then the screeching sound like the end of a tape at the end of the little elf part . And all i remember after that sound was watching one of the best this summer . was awesome , you cannot fault him at all in this film , well you cant fault him in many of his . Its just so good to see someone who cant act amazingly well and yet change their face so many times in one film that a some you forget its . He his part awesomely , and he did really overdo his part but i actually think that Count to be overdone , i mean one of my was when he had his acting party round and they were all asleep , then you suddenly hear ,  go back to prehistoric times when the earth  that was funny his were hilarious . but not just that scene every scene he to do it ended in a laugh . Even the 3 little were great , Violet whom I  only seen in Ghost ship did a remarkable job , she is an upcoming star i think , and then there  s Clause who i would much rather like to see in a part such as Harry potter , just by seeing him in this film . He like the other 2 really did a grade A job at acting . The actual story was at times , but even so it really was greatly directed and put together . So please whether you  read the or not this film is awesome and should be watched by one and all , young and old . It really is a joy to watch !!!",1
"This was probably the best movie I have seen all summer !! The only thing that could have made it better would be if the girl and the alien had made out at the end . I mean , this movie had a classic love - story plot , but we never got the inter - species love pay - off . See , the best thing about was that it really broke all the of good movie - making . I knew this movie was going to be good when none of the had for the first half hour ( or more !). And I was that they actually off everyone ! Such ! They just took the of good film - making and spit on them . And it worked ! I don  t think the even to see if the plot made sense . Because frankly , I  t even list all the plot , they were so numerous ! Amazing !",0
"This movie was great ! I was highly the release of it ago . The story of cave going down in one of the is an interest grabber . The sub par to being realistic , but the special effects me at during the film . The acting  t as terrible as some given by on yahoo and such stand offish are often expressed because of a closed mind . This movie me a lot of Alone in the Dark and also of the film  The Relic . The Relic was an older movie , but along very similar . If you The Relic or Alone in the Dark , The Cave is a must see !",0
"My neighbor bought this newly ( unrated ) from and I just pray that she can get a refund !!! In this sequel to The Ring we have the lead ( and creepy son ) starting off in a new small , quaint , boring town . Already there is a  murder  with a poor teenage girl left and speechless ( this is actually the best part of the film with a great plot setup ). ( ) is again working for a publication and upon this gruesome scene ( she the victim  s body ), two and  Two  together and the tape and it ablaze ending the Samara saga \u0097 so she . However , creepy , black and white , Samara , other , she to live on earth and have a Mommy she can call her own , so she little  s body ( again with the creepy son that needs to get rid of some dark eye with good concealer ). What is to do . She is accused of her now possessed son by Doctor of Psychiatry ( wasted in this role ). goes off to find Samara  s real birth mother ; Sissy ( a very performance with a lot of potential to explain scary Samara ), and some motherly advice on how to save her son . Baker the potential romantic interest that is trying to help and son . Of course , experience shown that any man trying to help and son , \u0097 and he does . and Samara battle for  s soul / body / life and the film with maybe finishing off Samara . The Ring Two should never have been as it was . The was an  unrated  version that was  not shown in  that could have been shown on the channel without any . The acting is very good although we have some incredibly talented that were wasted in this film : Sissy , , and . The subplot with Sissy as Samara  s biological mother is very interesting , and so much potential , it was very disappointing to me that it  t further and made to be the main plot of this sequel . There is still no explanation of Samara  s , origin , or creepiness . And why the hell does she use video tape as her method of transmission into this realm ? The best part of this new release is the short film  . It is as tying the two together , although it does not . This short , which could be a full length thriller in its own right , the novelty and  trip  that local teens have discovered that this video can take them on . They use the and web to chronicle their with the tape , but no one made it to Day 7 ( you know that Day 7 ). Thus the setup for the beginning of this sequel and the fun commercial that was airing prior to the theatrical release of  The Ring Two  that into thinking  not another teen romance movie . I recommend that you wait for cable for this one . Don  t waste your money on the purchase , borrow it if you can , let someone else spend their cash . If they make another  Ring  movie , I hope they get a new director . Also , the creepy , somewhat mystical , is so in film today that it actual the value of a good horror film .",1
"Gritty , violent , stylish , but in no way does it glorify the . The bad is shown to so heavily outweigh the good , and when people fight they get hurt . There  s not that much good to be seen in the movie , but it is a very good movie , and I would think something which the and of these of people very well . The opening fight scene is pretty harsh , and I have to say the only  enjoyable  fight scene of the film . Now by enjoyable , I mean in a entertainment sense , because the violence in this movie is so real , you don  t want to think that it the standard template of violence and glorify it in anyway , however this scene does slightly , and perhaps to grab the audience because hereafter you  be and uneasy . The second fight scene of the movie pointing out as well , because it some great effects and camera work to provide a different look to a scene shot so many times before . It  s hand - and close up , and these are not my particular in fight , because you miss so much you have to end up guessing what  s happening , I wish they  d look more to movie on how to do this right . However the style in this scene comes through with the use of a couple of effects which make the whole fight seem quite , perhaps how the main character it . It really gave some excitement and confusion to the scene , yet keeping the feeling of violence very real , and very nasty . Now , onto perhaps two of the most controversial of the movie , and no , I  already about the fighting and that  s not one of them . Firstly the casting of Wood as the who this world of Football . Many people are saying that he just  t suit the movie , that he  s totally out of place , well I agree but only to a point . Yes , for most of the film he  s out of place , his laughing seem awkward , like those when you tell a joke and your foreign friend  t catch it but anyway because everyone else does . You see , I think perhaps he is supposed to be looking totally out of place and awkward here , I mean he  s come from and is a Journalist , why would that make him feel easy in amongst Football ? He redemption though , in the final act of the film he a tough decision , and I really do believe it  s from this point on that he comes into his element and a very good performance . Still , there is that stigma associated with his most famous role to date , and it  s very prominent here . The  fish out of water  style and awkwardness is also easily taken as bad acting , that said I could be wrong and it could actually be bad acting ! The second controversial part of the movie is something that perhaps only people in the will grab ,  s accent . His cockney accent is pretty bad , there are when he into it , but there is a distinct feeling that he  s over pronunciation much of what he  s saying , particularly the Cockney . However , the accent to the side his performance is really good and very convincing , when you see him give an order , take control of a situation or in the midst of a fight , you believe who he is 100 %. Without a doubt he strong and single minded , and a very violent character . Yet for me , it  s that the screen . His performance as is totally immersive and you  re drawn to him on screen . If I remember , the Director and Writer , him at the Q & A after the premiere as the  s answer to , and you can see why . He all those that draw you to . Let  s hope he  s for it . Both Marc Warren and are just as convincing and give strong , I  always Warren as an actor and is a new find for me . These two have a good chemistry , although not all that you  d expect from a married couple , an emotional performance . Bell as Hatcher , the leader of the Firm , is a true . Totally broken and void of the understanding of , you can see he  s by complete hatred and anger . He just such a real character and a truly scary man ! The of retribution , and karma are very strong throughout this movie . It  s an example of how good the script is when you can understand the allure of the Firm for the character of , as well as see and understand the bonding between the . It does a lot for the audience to help them understand the reasoning behind it all , and this is where I think the controversy for . These are the that can be as a positive light on the Football rather than the actual fighting , and it  s not hard to see that . Yet I do think it  s balanced by the retribution and karmic shown . Overall a strong movie , although Wood  s casting is very unusual and quite awkward during the first two of the film , coupled with the poor accent of the lead and there lie the negative . The story , portrayal of the and the violence itself all give for a strong and hard movie , although perhaps more attractive to a audience .",0
"The idea of making the series of unfortunate into a film was a good one . One that was faithful to the , but honestly at the same time I  m also thinking , this was defiantly NOT really faithful to the series for me the movie sort of ruined the . Count is supposed to be a creepy and threatening villain , correct me if I  m wrong but Carry made him into a goofy and silly character . The should have gotten a more serious , intense and dark actor with a little bit of humor at the same time which was displayed in the original . The production design was a little too over the top as well . of it me a bit of a gloomy setting of the cat and the hat or the new Grinch who stole . All I  m really trying to say is that they took a smart and wonderful series of and personally it into a goofy movie . But i  give it a few for trying . I  s not TERRIBLE , but it  s not great either .",1
"the concept  t miss anything . the team leader  s way of making people agree with him ( along with the support of his brother ) and how paradoxical the path to escape are what i remember scene by scene - the emphasis definitely to the audience . however , when the team is being by the demonic looking , it way too shaky to follow , making it almost impossible to look at the screen because you can  t see anything clearly . other than that , since  beneath hell lied the cave  i to see more of those  bad , after all they  been there for supposedly without from the outside world . overall it  s an exciting movie and i had a really good time watching it .",1
"seen the trailer for this after going to see Unleashed I decided that this film would be worth the money to go see in the cinema . If you go to see this film be prepared for a film . This film is best seen in the cinema because of the atmosphere by the big screen and by the surround sound . The rest of the film is filled with some really stupid dialogue and several cheesy . However saying that the back story is quite interesting ... well the back back story or the legend of the cave . Thats the interesting bit . its briefly in the start of the film and then thrown away as a of escape near the end . This film will be from soon i think and coming to a bargain bin near you by . After all ..... * SPOILER COMING UP * ........ after all when you see a picture of the creature / demon and it do you really expect a member of the cast to scream  It can fly ! no ! I to scream at the screen  What do you think its for . However the worse part of the film is the end which is just straight out of and is completely unoriginal , i saw it coming from off and unfortunately it there will most likely be a sequel . In ... I some but most of this movie was weak , and completely unoriginal . I would recommend it if its all your cinema is showing really .",1
"Yes this film is not only action , its extremely funny and also very disturbing in . I like to think i am not in a minority in thinking the idea of a man raised to be a killing machine and a killing machine alone as disturbing . And it is disturbing to see Jet Li as be in this way by Bob in a fantastic and funny role as . The action in this film is especially at the start where between the first and the next big happen like half an hour later , however i this as it gave me more time to relate to the human side of . Which in an essence is the movie because even though he is a lean mean killing machine , if he went around and did this for the whole 102 he would pretty much not change at all and that is the aim of the film for , to change . The film very well with some great dialogue and some interesting . One of my of the film is when first in the underground club and their champion with one blow . The champion like a up masked wrestler and Jet Li just him and him , it was great . Morgan Freeman really well as is of one of assets . His blind Sam me a little of Ray with his charm and piano . His dialogue is good and his character very solid and warm . His step daughter by the lovely and funny Kerry it her mission to rehabilitate and Kerry really the role . The as well are all brilliant and have some great dialogue . The story as I have already said is sound and the acting fantastic the only point some Jet Li may disagree on is the action . I myself felt that the lack of action in some was more than made up in the final fight sequence with multiple , a cramped toilet and a beautiful move that i can only describe as a knee drop . I really this movie and will buy it as soon as I can get my on it . Until then I am going back to the cinema again and again to watch this some more .",1
"I know not a lot of people are going to see this until it comes out on , which is a shame , because this is precisely why there are less and less horror that are in . Anyway - The Cave is an awesome monster movie . There been that trend lately , of horror being shot and intended for am  R  release , but then get cut down to a - 13 , only to be release as  Unrated  on . Problem being , when you  re watching them in the , it like you  re watching a movie that to be more , but had itself . Yes , The Cave is rated - 13 , but I never felt I was watching a movie that was heavily . The was just enough blood so you realize what  s going on , but the action too fast to really linger . Part of the fun is being in the dark ( figuratively speaking ) with the . I think the only thing missing for an  R  pic was bad language . The were awesome , and you saw just enough to get an idea of what they like , while still being in enough shadow to still make you curious as to what they REALLY . ( On a side note - though they never say it , and nor is it heavily at , the are a cool way of explaining early of , being that the story place in the ...) I saw the ending coming from away , but I still it , and thought that it was the way to end the film . So , I it a lot . It  s not everybody  s cup o  tea , and not terribly original , but it  s a damn good monster movie .",1
", perhaps there is truth in the saying  lost in translation  because I absolutely do not understand why this movie the praise it . It is a mess , an absolute mess from beginning to end . The only positive thing I can say about it is the wickedly twisted revenge plot . There is no cohesive story line , no attempt to give the viewer any kind of clue about what is going on . You are kept in the dark the whole time , which I assume is the point . But by the time the final roll , you want to borrow one of the used in the movie and beat yourself over the head with it to stop the pain that the film on your from trying to make any kind of sense of it . I have since gone back and watched this film again without the and though I still feel it is way over , I do not feel it is as bad as my initial review of it above . I have given it another star from my original 4 that I gave it . Still , the movie",0
"This movie is so well - done from the beginning up to the end . does a great job in this movie . The acting from simply is brilliant , and should of won the Academy Award for best actress . Her character like the other three main ( and ) have a very hard life that just getting harder . some comedy into the film , but very little . THE MOVIE IS DEPRESSING . No doubt about that so if you are looking for a laugh don  t watch this one . Still the movie does an excellent job in every aspect . I won  t say how the plot is because i hate but it is very engaging . Bottom line i recommend this movie to everyone and give it 10 / 10 which i don  t do very often . so that go and see it . Peace",1
"Sideways is  s masterpiece . A drama / comedy that is both intellectually interesting and very funny . With great , smart direction and a great script , this film is perfect . is perfectly cast and does a great job here , my favorite of the film ( although the academy only gave to Church and ). I thought the whole cast was good , even the director  s wife ( soon to be ), oh , who was very believable as a liberal swinger chick . I also church , who is very believable as a television actor , it sort of fit him for me since I was actually used to seeing him on show . was also great , and in my opinion an worthy performance here . The film  s script is great , good work from and collaborator . Its the best part about the film , i mean i would have never thought I would be so interested in a film that had about and wine throughout , but it worked .

"watched on today , I was sadly disappointed . The plot along at a fair pace and is all great fun , but there are times when the fact that several critical plot from the book have been from the version the film very weak and more superficial than it needs . The appearance of an old aeroplane in the middle of the desert just when our need transport , with no explanation , combined with the missing links to President from the original excellent Clive story , appear to have been or saved for the US version ( What is that all about - give a break !) The try their best with the subsequently disjointed plot , but although it was a good film , it could have been great , with just a few extra by way of explanation . Don  t miss it - it is a good laugh , but make sure you read the book afterwards .",1

I wonder if he actually the , and other wildlife more by his  saving  of them ? The should be left wild , and never - ever feel relaxed around , for their sake and ours .

"There are that aim to entertain , and there are that attempt to say something . This movie to do both , and admirably . Sure , upon reflection , various of the plot don  t seem to follow from one another , and so many in the movie are implausible . But does one want a movie that is as smooth and plausible as yesterday afternoon ? Like it or not , human life is tortured and without warning . What is making sense of it afterwards in a way of one  s choosing . This movie is not really about revenge . It is about the human need for knowing not just about oneself , but about other people . The protagonist could never have lived with himself without knowing why certain to him . Our make no sense when the of are . Most touching in the movie was the woman  s sacrifice for the protagonist and his for her .

"... WELL , maybe that  s a slight stretch - but hey , I  m sure there were ( and are ) numerous good for this movie  s unprecedented success , like mainly : the invincible combination of two  hot  young ; an established action / adventure director ; a bloated budget that nevertheless to show off some seriously cutting - edge , , effects , ; a classic love story set against one of the most tragic in early - twentieth - century history ; and , of course , leading from all , the sheer curiosity from countless and alike , to see just exactly what all the was about - which obviously off , making it the highest - film ( still ! After nearly a decade !), and one of three tied record for the most won by a film .

"! a few .! This movie is horrible , I thought of it as more of a comedy then a horror .

People are  Will there be another The Ring movie ? I hope not , but then again if I  m in a Comedy mood I will have a movie to rent . Two of themselves and proving nothing but the complete obvious . If Samara comes back I will forget the Horror and just move on to something else . If your easily by fake looking Elk or mind - numbing babble then DO NOT rent this movie , but if your looking for a good laugh I recommend it .",1

In the same night I also rented  The Farewell , a German film about the last days of . That  s more my typical fare : the quiet character study of a great artist and the who love him .

"While I the original well enough ( 1967 , with ), it was a bit too serious . Yes , inter - racial , especially marriage , might be seen by some as a serious situation , but even in 1967 , would a family * really * have handled it like they did in the film ? It a forced and ingenuous . On the other hand , this one ( Guess Who , 2005 ) it all out on the table and is absolutely hilarious . There  s no stepping on or worry about  political correctness .

It was just more realistic than the original ... and realistic almost always  funny . I also thoroughly the reason for ( ) leaving his job at the first of the film .

I just got done watching this movie about a half hour ago and I  m in complete awe . this was by far the most original movie I have ever seen . It so many different genre and yet them all and as it  s own unique work . The acting is top notch I might add . Don  t go into this movie anything at all . Just sit , and watch , and take in the full experience . If you can appreciate an original movie , despite some unpleasant or even disturbing , then this movie will likely hit you like a . For me , this movie will easily be one of those in my collection that I value as more than just a movie , and will re - watch many many times for to come .",0

The movie actually out great and I the puppetry work , but the constant and unneeded did not add anything to the movie . The theme song throughout the movie  Team @!&@ Yeah  got real old real quick . There was also a sex scene in the uncut version which was funny in the beginning and then got downright disgusting . Once again the of South Park disappoint . If they had taken out the constant and had toned down some of the it would have been an movie ( but then again would say it  t be a movie from the South Park ). Warning : Do not rent this movie if you have !",0
"always felt to me like the one who got away . Like an Potter she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time in the wrong , one breakthrough moment away from being a household name . Horror might know her work in and fantasy will have she was in Highlander 2 as they were walking out . But to me she  s Madeline in the prophetic Electric , breaking three hearts at the same time , , his computer and mine . Now here she is in the fantastic Sideways one nomination away from a statue . I think she  s basically finally won hearts via a single speech she at the heart of the film in which her character Maya why she wine . I won  t give away the , but by the end you  love wine and love her too . But that  s one of the great about Sideways -- the chance to see I  whose work I for , which no one else of in something which everyone is talking about . I was afraid was going to end up being  the guy from Splendor  for the rest of his career but here people are a name to a face they  been seeing for . Look at his there are very few you haven  t of . In fact in some he  s even proto - , especially  s in which karaoke was his love instead . Oh might look like a discovery but she  s equally always been busy ( Bean : The Ultimate Disaster Film to Under the Sun ). I remember her from Last Night and The Red Violin in which she had a quiet dignity far removed from . If I  m being honest though I  never watched the so I don  t know about the cult of Church . But is in of the Jungle which is good enough for me . In casting these , knew exactly what he was doing . Apparently was actively for  s part . that further , we could have ended up with Brad , and some young actress . All perfectly fine and they would have their well , and the chemistry would have been there , but it would have felt false -- this  t need a successful cast -- a dream cast . It a group of who all kind of familiar without being  famous  because these are who are just like us or people we know . Very refreshing .",1
"I  start by making it clear , I am a fan of Firefly and of Joss  s writing . That being said , I am not afraid of pointing out any in what he . His are often his biggest . Some people dismiss his writing because they feel that the are too witty or some such . I urge even those people to give Serenity a chance , if disbelief can be suspended to imagine a universe of the future , surely the same can be done for unrealistic wit of the dialogue . So , on to the film . As an adaptation of a television series that many in the audience wont have seen , the start of Serenity needs to be exposition heavy . It is . And as it , I feared that it would collapse under the weight of the back story to be told . It unfolded , becoming a story within a within a simulation , and we  re to the infinitely Operative . I this film was going to go to some dark ... this scene re - assured me that was the case . I almost forgot I was watching exposition - overload . During the second most shot I  seen this year ( the other was Ark ), we  re re - to all the from the series . Then we  re straight into the thick of it . Up until this point , we  just been our way to the top of the roller - coaster . Now we  re finally about to be let go , and one word is all that it . . Serenity  t seem to let you breathe for a moment , effortlessly flitting between hilarity , tragedy , drama and action ( sometimes in the same second ). Although the plot is ultimately fairly straightforward , the journey that you to the end is what - and it  s a damn good one . At a time when there to be nothing but effects - driven science fiction ( with the exception of a few notable smaller - such as ), it  s great to have a script that about it  s as much as the . To any Star looking for that 1977 magic . To any Star Trek looking for to care about . This is your next port of call . Serenity is science - fiction at it  s . And if you get a chance , catch Firefly on first .",1
"Very good . I think director was compassionate and tasteful in leaving out the grisly . Some may find themselves looking forward to in a macabre way , but director you to listen to the sad plight of this individual who sought refuge in nature , but only brought along his own of suffering from rejection and the bitterness towards all people because of it . It is obvious that in his bitterness and loneliness , he chose to latch on to and nature , but when we find  salvation  in just a part of God  s creation ( instead of in God ) we easily pass over into obsession , and this it  s built in curse . He salvation in something that  t save , so it him . He how he is special and can circumvent all the usual safety normal in being around wild , and shortly thereafter , his presumptuous attitude him instant karma !! But he is tragic , and my heart for the lost and lonely . On a lighter note - i wish he could gotten a clue and just gotten a dog or cat that he was over like the rest of us .",1
"This movie is a highly creative and action film from the Hong kung fu genre . A lot of wit , slapstick , visual effects , killer kung fu , and a unique plot offer an incredibly fun and entertaining film . Wonderful acting and elevated this film to a level , on par with with other unique and innovative like Crouching Tiger or The Matrix . At one time I all kung fu ( like most , I could only tolerate Lee and  t understand goofy kung fu cinema .) Thanks to like this , I now look forward to edgy modern kung fu . Two up !",1
"Though the in this sequel is not as cohesive as in  The Ring , the visual of this film are stellar , perhaps even more than in the original , and hold the viewer frozen in front of the screen . The same stunning of the original cursed tape still work perfectly and the effects used in the sequel are great . Set in , it not only is a wonderfully spooky tale , but the backdrop of the Pacific northwest is perfect . But the highlight of this film is still the incredibly spooky little girl Samara , who may be the since the original Exorcist ! The supplemental material   on the is a must see after watching the movie . A fun and watch . Be sure to see it in the dark !",1
"It  s a horrible comment to make , perhaps off - to some but true all the same - Serenity is a very brave film . Not only for to debut as a feature director with a space epic . Or to resurrect a show  , a failure ( the and illegal of the show while it screened suggest otherwise ). To fashion a film , a genre film , that the theme Joss chosen for Serenity is a bold and brilliant move . - fi of late been degraded even further from its as imaginative romance and speculative fiction to blockbuster clutter . Many tub - thumping  , of the last few are guilty of this . Serenity the balance . And hey . Space . Cool ;-)",1

"The basis behind The Grudge is that there  s a myth that when a person ( typically murder or some type of passionate context ), a curse in that space that to haunt anyone who involved . This curse the individual until they die . The Grudge is supposedly made shot for shot with the version . To jump to my summary , the film does a terrific job in building suspense and making you feel incredibly uneasy . The sound effects are great ! While the plot  t make entirely too much sense , it  s believable , for the moment . ( a very convincing , I  m no Buffy fan ) is a transplant to Japan . She there with her . a local university and does community work for experience . Her work is helping housebound . an elderly woman who is frightened by a mysterious force ( the curse ). The , about the house , that a Professor ( Bill ) who is indirectly involved in a death . The movie does a lot of but is effective . Not as good as The Ring but worth a rental .",1
"I have been an avid follower of Joss  s work for many . The cancellation of Firefly series ( upon which this movie is based ) broke my heart . This film more than the situation . It is more than just another episode of Firefly . This is the culmination of all the of effort that Joss put into his work , brought to life with a big film budget . My only complaint is that I felt the story a little than I would have . This is not so much a criticism of the film so much as a limitation of the medium . On , this story could be paced out across a season and more time spent on exploring the more carefully . That said though , there are in this movie that could never have been on television , and not just from a visual standpoint , but also a narrative one . And in the end , this is what this a wholly satisfying experience . Without a doubt , my number one film of 2005 .",1
"I saw this blind , only seen the trailer a couple of times almost a year ago . I was hard - for a film to buy , so I got this . The most gorgeous film I have in some . While there are many , many to admire and enjoy in this film , the most striking aspect is the sumptuous production design and virtually seamless effects work . Every shot is delicately and acutely to perfection and , without read any of the Lemony Snicket , you get a tangible sense of the grandeur which they undoubtedly contain . The design the film a very Burton - esquire air , though I fear that is selling the film short , as director Brad is becoming more confident with each film , his own niche in cinema . With his previous , City of , Moonlight Mile and now this , his work together as on the impact of death on the living and , dealt with a one  s death himself , he is carving an  s body of work , balancing adult material and family expertly . While there is indeed plenty for to enjoy , not least  s manic and hilarious performance ( s ) and the overall sense of awe , in many ways it is a  s film for , much in the same vein as  s were bedtime would enjoy reading and indeed . This is by the uniformly wonderful and offbeat of all involved . , of course , is perfect as , it up delightfully yet believing he is the world  s actor . If I had one complaint , it would be that we simply don  t see enough of his - I was enjoying his one - legged sea captain immensely , but he  t on screen long enough . The are excellent , without a trace of mawkishness or Jake - like discomfort . Browning is surely set to become one of  s most beautiful young and , unlike most of her , talent to back up her . also a bright future ahead of him , holding his own against a stellar cast . And what a cast , full of famous and familiar , from - - the always reliable Streep and - through well - known character such as Timothy Spall , Billy and , to the cultish of O  , and Jane . The cast is every bit as finely picked as those of the Harry Potter , though frankly I would rather sit through one of these each year . While the story is by its nature episodic - the Lemony Snicket are very short and this film three of them , each about a half hour of screen time - move at a fair pace and there is never any boredom thanks to the inventive , witty , often hilarious script . Add to this an interesting and very enjoyable score and some grand set , as well as a mystery running through the film , and this is ideal family fare of the highest order . A sequel would be most welcome , though it doubtful at this stage whether we will receive one . Extra mention must be made of the and .

"Grizzly Man works on a lot of different . However , as a addict and alcoholic , what I found most interesting about the film was how it exposed Timothy as an addict ( alcoholic ) who may have his substance addiction ( and alcohol ) for a process addiction ( gambling , sex , danger ) with the . Like all in their disease ( and not in recovery ), he basically more and more bear to get the same fix ( high ) he experienced during his initial contact with them . With all , there is a progressive movement away from truth . As Timothy  s bear addiction him away from reality and toward a state of  insanity . His distorted thinking becomes apparent in the footage he shot of himself ( that was never on his Special , The Grizzly ).  ( without recovery ) are almost always progressive and fatal . -- about Timothy  s behavior , from the anger at the Forest Service and exaggerated paranoia about , to his delusional thinking about actually being a bear , a person trapped in their disease and moving further away from reality . Add to the fact , that his thinking process was based upon faulty . And this is where his lack of formal training or education in zoology , or any of the natural , really came back to bite him . ( No pun intended ). A  non - addict  thinking person would have understood that if a male bear will kill to stop a female bear from so that she  want to mate again , and that hungry do eat other to survive , that maybe they could eat me too ! Like all , Timothy progressively self - centered , isolated , paranoid , confused , , perfectionist , blinded to his disease ( denial ), insane , blaming ( projection ), and . In short , his life had become unmanageable . And ultimately it put him , his and at least two to death .  s film works as a tragedy . But also as a cautionary tale for all , that can be summed - up by a lyric from Young :  The very thing that you live , can kill you in the end . -- Young",1
"I was reading through from here , and came across this one ( who incidentally gave it a low review ):  I have just finished watching  Open Water  and must admit that I have been left feeling rather confounded as to how I am meant to feel about the content of this film . That , my , is unfortunately the mentality of the average film - goer . So used to being spoon - fed , that a movie like this will probably seem like total crap . After all , it  t tell you how you  re supposed to feel and what you  re supposed to think ! I found the film to be very suspenseful and a great existential meditation . I may have been lucky in totally the ... I was never even aware of this film until my brother rented it on , and was able to view it with no at all . I found it very spooky and well made ( far better than  Blair Witch Project ). Some of the were a bit cheesy , but not too terrible ( like the  Nobody we know ever { insert phrase here }). These few cheesy can be in the scheme of , particularly with such a low budget involved . Overall I give this a 7 / 10 ... a good watch for the thoughtful , patient ( yes , an attention span is actually in this one -- will never cease ?).",1
"There should be a rule that quite clearly that like Resident Evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game , not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible . RE was a survival horror game , and a damn effective one at that , yet to make it like any other video game movie to come along . Alone in the Dark is essentially the same kind of a spirit as Resident Evil , so of course , there is the slight hope the director will manage to have some piece of a brain enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie . Instead , Alone in the Dark just that there is no longer hope for video becoming . The plot , despite the fact that it obviously  t supposed to matter , is the of many with the movie . The movie with what can only be as five of text that may or may not be important , as after a minute , the audience and just through the rest the object to them . Then there  s something about an , some , an ancient tribe , some bureaucracy and some , all of which get so together that the really can  t follow with what is going on . move in and out of the plot like candy , some huge build - for meaningless . Basically , what I can understand is that some got , and ( Slater ) some link to them thanks to some operation given to in his which on him . He an artefact the and it to an ex - anthropologist ( ), who of course he to have sex with right away for no good reason . Then , out of nowhere , all hell loose , and the pair end up with a military team led by some commander ( ), who apparently a mutual hatred for . It  s all ridiculous , and the reason I don  t really understand it  t just because it  s complicated and , but it leaves no room for anyone to really care . Instead , I highly recommend that , if you must see this film , bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot to bore you into confusion . The action in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little , right ? Too bad , this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made , with enough quick to behead a coop of . Considering that this is based on a horror game , not an action game , it is especially annoying . The first action scene a man chasing from a taxi is among the worst I have ever had to witness , and the rest  t all that great either . The look somewhat cool , though the fact that they turn into powder when away all that effect . lots of which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera and panning faster than the head of a crack addict . It  s all the kind of seizure crap that in bed at night . The acting is what I like to call taking and making them do nothing . Slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie , though he does seem to have more talent than he is on . The same is true of , who a thankless role despite actually some talent ( something that to him a lot ). is pretty much exactly what she should be , background sex appeal , as whenever she to act it is a disaster ( as is the incredibly bad scientist look she in the beginning ). In all , this is the type of movie that me about future video game . If they keep the spirit like this , it  s only a matter of time before is killing Middle - with an AK - 47 and Tommy is fighting a squadron of . Unlike Resident Evil , however , this one  t deserve a second chance , as I don  t think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is . It  s bland , uninteresting and unexciting . This is the movie equivalent of diarrhea ; it  s all thrown together , nothing really and , in the end , you  re just glad it  s over . TOTAL : 4 %",1
"I was lucky enough to get a ticket to a special preview showing in of Serenity . I cant say I was a massive fan of the show , it took me a long while to really get into it . Once I was really looking forward to seeing the movie , through word of mouth I had it was a damn fine film . Now seen it I can confirm it is the most satisfying movie I have seen this year . Everything about this movie is enjoyable from the effects to the script to the action . This movie  t disappoint ... no here , just go see it when it .. A Massive bonus was a 30 minute Q & A with Joss and Summer who were both very engaging and funny ..",1
"This film is a cross between  The Insider  and  Hotel . Ralph , an diplomat assigned to ; whose wife , ( ), is on a mission . She is idealistic and to make a difference . The problem is she does not know what she is up against . Based on the best - selling novel and directed by ( the Academy Award - nominated director of  City of God ), this movie is a strong drama of a woman  s fight to make a difference in . Because if she  t , who will ? This movie really the harsh of Northern and how cheap life really is in all of . It how with the right backing , large can get away with almost anything . Almost anything . Both Ralph and are good in this movie . They really convince you that they care foe one another . While at the same time , they with their own .",0
"prior , my favorite were star and gone with the wind -- no joke , now it  s Serenity . I was lucky enough to catch a preview , and all I can say is , it  s brilliant . The writing , the cinematography , everything -- every single second of the movie is refined to the very last bit . I while crying , cried while laughing -- easily , EASILY , the best movie i have ever seen in my life . Unfortunately -- I  m going not talking about it , as it most conventional movie -- talking about it too much it away , but suffice to say -- amazing even self - , but all the more amazing if you  re a fan of the show .",1
"I have read many of the and have no more to add other than to share how sobering it is to that , as we  re in midst of general in this country , how our preoccupation with utter trivia ( like how many extra discretionary $$ s we  be better off if we give our vote to this or that party ) into shameful embarrassment that our are so trivial to a degree that  s cringe - making .

"Only my reluctance to give anything a perfect ten out of ten me from rating this film ten . What an absolutely awesome flick ! I just saw it with my husband and I can  t think when I last saw a movie I this much . It had the whole package - style , innovation , solid ( and often sympathetic ) , romance , martial , good , bad , comedy , great cinematography , pathos ... Go see it now ! God , I this movie . I thought hard trying to come up with a single criticism and this is the best I can do - on the incongruous sound effects are more than effective . That  s it . There  s nothing else wrong with this movie !",1
"This movie to elicit extreme at both of the spectrum . I am at the positive end , because it with me enormously . It the contrast between two men ; Jack - an insensitive overgrown a final fling before getting married , and - a sensitive self - absorbed loser whose life is getting worse . The contrast is brought out in their with the two , and the urgent rush into infidelity by Jack and the hesitant approach of and Maya that off . I the emotional content of and Maya  s relationship , one that to bring hope to lonely people - never give up . I think that those who have condemned this movie have had different life or have little patience with people who struggle . Entering into the of the is very rewarding . I know nothing about wine , don  t even drink it , but the pretentiousness of the wine - talk was funny and oiled the of the story .",1
"I personally this movie . It is one of those that will make you think while watching it , and that some of a intelligent movie . It is not for those who are very narrow minded . It is a very tale with a trying to escape the pain of his inner pain all dealing with the subject of time travel . It is not a very intense movie for being rate  R  there is brief violence only one real scene , some language some f and the drug content is very mild . It is not very younger not much for the sake of  rating  but for the and the story itself which very hard to follow . Many people will not understand until watching it about 2 - 4 times . I had to watch it twice to really get it . all in all this is a piece of movie - making genius , and i believe is very . I believe this was an excellent movie and i give it a 9 . 5 out of 10",1
"There are inevitable disappointing to this sequel , taking place only a few after the first Ring ( 02 ), tho the is obviously quite older . A level of dread is there from the very beginning but it never . It sort of stays at the same beat throughout : , back as ,  t go on a journey of discovery here , further of horror . She already all about the tape and so do we . Yes , she does uncover further information about Samara , that now - tiresome spirit which  t go away and leave her and her son alone , but it  s . And then , midway , the only truly surprising sequence a sudden switch to the  - terror  of the , this time with killer deer . Say what ? It  s more hysterical than terrifying : the computer here don  t work very well in of the sequence , as if rushed . And deer are the last I would pick to be scary ; maybe that was the intent ( the least ) but it  t work for me . It was a central set piece and removing it probably  t an option . The rest of the pic , a form of possession ,  t anything new to horror and is even tedious . What  s weird is after a saw this sequel , it suddenly to me that the  ring  may also refer to the phone ringing ; but that may be because I watched the first Ring again .",1
"As a fan I left wishing I had not read the book before seeing the film ! Although the of the tale were there it was so about so as not to be funny . There were that never took place and that should have been there that were totally missing or beyond all recognition . Neither Dirk or Al much like in the , however was close if a little thin . Taking the fact that I had read the book out it was a passable effort at an action adventure , which was much better than the only previous try at one of - Raise the Titanic ( 1980 ) which him to say never would another film be made of his , this time sadly he will mean it ! A great shame as the have great potential . The humour that was there did make me smile and the action was reasonable for what it was .",0
"I  m not sure why the distribution company made such a big fuss over this version being unrated .. but I tell you this is a fairly tame movie . Especially if you compare it to the first movie . There is no real gore , nudity , or violence . The best thing about this movie is the and not much else . a shrink , Cole a minor role as a real estate agent , and Sissy  s birth mother . Good , but unfortunately , thats all they are . No character is in any way - not even the ghost . I  t think it was worth the money to spend - its slow and boring . I just to see the history of , but the movie just who she is and why she  s  character . Overall , this movie does not meet my expectation for scary / horror . It just  t have the fear factor in it of the original . However , if you get the and watch the little - film  , you  be half out of your mind !",1
"Despite what I have from other and many other people who have seen the Ring Two , I am sorry to say that I really disagree with all of you ... The effects were great , and many people don  t seem to see what the connection between the and the deer are in this film and the last ..... If you can recall , Samara the go crazy , so off course when they move ... since Samara them ... she the deer go crazy ... see ? THE CONNECTION !!!!!... and I have to say , this movie may not have built suspense , but when you least it , something scary happening , for example : a noise or something that , and of course the music selection was great ... making me on edge because scary music = scary !... This movie was great , switching the whole story around , and to connect the two , they incorporated the movie that you into it !!!... but then made it a seemingly whole new movie ... It was a very good movie despite what u all think .! ~~",1
"I bought this film just due to its high score on . I was not disappointed . My comment to my wife after seeing this , was  nothing actually , but I could still not take my from the screen . This movie works like emotional magic to a guy who normally to action , horror and . off to the , the script writer and the director . And no off to the people who make me write 10 . I don  t care if I  m from writing more by these final meaningless . I  used since it was born , and this is the first time I  actually felt like telling the world a movie is worth watching . It  s probably also the last time , so just ban me from further .",1
"I like it when I do know know how to feel ! to start out by a man , Timothy , as a crazy , self - ( NOT Grizzly - ) individual who himself and his for no purpose , in the wilderness . Initially I thought that the story was a cross between  Jackass  and the Discovery Channel - you have a dopey , though he only like it , blonde surfer type who to approach ( awfully close ) and make sweet - talk with 10 - foot . might see Timothy as a reckless , selfish misfit , but as the film , your appreciation for his cause - but what is his cause ? Is it to work out personal ? Absolutely . clearly mental / emotional , just listen to how many times he the wild  I love you ! or when he about his lack of success with  human . But his passion for the and their wilderness is real . particularly him as a , seizing unique and rendering priceless footage . Do not forget that lived close to the for 13 ( the year he was ) without harm ; and that his success , his careful , intuitive , loving behavior was only partly self - .",1
"Well , the movie was shot very beautifully . I do wish , however , that at the end of the film , the culture could have been through the of less shallow , people . Why should I feel sorry for a girl who is with her life and who is a snob ? And why should I feel sympathetic towards a man who is making 2 million and is about it ? Right there , one can easily see how unhealthy the modern society is ! At the end of the film , I do not see them their internal . He is not any happier or , she is still a confused person . The truth is these people were not working on making their family happier and I doubt that Bill  s character would go home and try to be a better husband or a happier father . What was so bad about  s character or his  that  s character had to laugh at them openly ? I , as a viewer was not given a reason to think that she was any better than them . I understood the whole searching for spiritual life on  s side , but for somebody who was Yale educated , it was foolish for her to think so low of people . The problem with a is that it had two that for no purpose but for some unrealistic hanging out ! The story line well , but the could have taught each other something useful .",1
"This is an awful movie , that should never of been made . None of the character  s feel real . The acting is very poor , none sound like the average West Ham fan . Why did they have a German director , This comes across as blatant racism against the football nation . Green Street miserably to reflect the Society that is truly a part of the real Green . This is tabloid exploitation film - making at it  s worst . They should not of set this in a real football club . This Rubbish just typecast  s all football as . Hopefully this movie will fail at the box office , both I . D and The Football Factory were better than this . Which just how terrible this is . 1 out of 10 but only because i  t give it zero .",0
"I like this movie for the following . first its screen play is perfect . The hero in a correct fashion . He lived the character . Through out the movie he a balanced mind . I like the movie because it about hope and how hope will bring happiness . I always used to think about it when ever I lose hope in doing some work or in my own . The two Hero and his friend were shown of opposite in nature . Hero always about hope and his friend opposite to hope . This me feel what really life will be without hope and with hope . One more thing It is It does not matter where we are but what we do .",1
"the first two ( which are directed by ) were , the third one as i see it it was junk . Now , i believe after the , to change the story . well it was disappointing . it  t lead me anywhere important about the whole Samara thing . if although you are a maniac about  the Ring  then i would recommend it to you but if you the first ring which indeed was perfect and you just want to learn more about Samara i  t recommend it to you . at the cinema would just a waste of time and money , at home ... maybe you  ill like it . i really hope there is a third one because then  The Ring Two  is just another horror junk film",1
"Wow where do I begin with this review ? If there ever was a Most Unnecessary Sequel title it goes to this piece of garbage . I mean I never saw this flick in the since I  t care for the first one which was slow boring and incredibly not scary . So I for the sequel since it was going to be Unrated on and so I  t have to waste my time driving to a theater if it was bad . Now I want my rental money back . Whoever thought this movie was better than the first , must have taste in their ass . What the hell was Unrated ? This movie was pointless ! I mean was it really necessary to drag out the movie to two ? I mean come on . This movie no , no , no point . I mean am I the only one who thought the acting was poop too ? I mean was nominated for an Academy Award but from her acting in the first half you  t have known . The whole deer scene was pointless and bad .. I mean after the first attack through the side check out  s side ... window still there and not for just a shot . I mean it  s almost like they kept to the scene after it was complete . Plus the was really bad . Here is a tip ... if it  t look real ... don  t add it ! Trust me it  t improve the movie , just wasted more time getting to the pointless conclusion . Speaking of which ... what was the point ? Just to close the * * well ? I mean this movie went against the point of the first . All of a sudden its like Poltergeist , opening and other stupid crap we  seen in good horror . Plus the hospital abuse scene was off from New Nightmare . Even as i type this ... I don  t understand why they spent money on such a unneeded sequel and it  s a shame when an extra on the is better than the actual movie . I would much rather have seen a full blown movie version of that . I read a review on 2 which read it was long , boring , not scary and a waste of time , I think they meant that review for The Ring Two . If you have no taste and actually get disturbed and from this , enjoy . Please never see a movie I make , but if you actually understand good film making and respect the genre , then don  t spend a dime to watch this . .",1

At times by implication sympathetically links with his former principle star and sparring partner , the late mad eccentric actor . Like had on a film set . But his set was the outdoors and there was no director to spar with ; his sparring were nature and his own psyche . Nature , of course , living , chief among them the grizzly he can kill him . He repeatedly the camera how much he them . He the , smaller near whose he his during the second halves of his summer . He the camera you must be firm with the , and he he how to handle them , even though he also repeatedly he he may die there . He is a gambler . Is he a complex man , or merely a confused one ? Is he brave , or just foolhardy ? What is his purpose in spending all this time among the ? Is he gathering information , or taking refuge among he need not please , only keep a safe distance from ( though he continually comes closer to than the park and good sense require )? He a soft manner and voice and even he he were gay . But he also and embarrassingly and tiresomely against unseen , , , , , park , the whole urban settled world he from to this world he and blindly as perfect . As , sought to disregard nature  s cruelty , and any time it was in his face -- as when the were in a dry spell and eating their own young -- he sought to manipulate nature to eliminate the ugliness . He not the but the rain . Young Timothy according to his was an ordinary boy who from childhood and got a diving scholarship to college . But he injured his back and quit college and he drank and when he went to LA to act and  t get a part on he  spiraled down . He never had a lasting relationship with a woman and the drinking serious and constant . In vain he tried , , self - discipline -- but the drinking went on and was killing him . Finally he got sober for the and the . He decided to devote his life to them and he to them that he would be clean and healthy . It was a miracle .

As the the Grizzly Man found back to civilization harder and harder to make . On the last occasion , an airport official him by the validity of his ticket and he turned around with his -- who was afraid of ! -- and returned to the  maze , the most dangerous of his summer because it  t in the open where the could see him and steer clear but among their and the brush .

And that is as it should be .",1

The cast is neatly from well known , and not so well known , and most give a five star performance despite a script that will draw a lot of criticism for being slightly right wing on the football hooliganism . Yes , it does pro to a degree , yes there is a lot of violence , mostly out of shot and into fast motion photography , but it works well in making you try to hide and , at the same time , face up to the supposed life of part of football society .

This is a sad tale about a man who apparently could not deal with society and could only find peace with his . What he thought was kinship with the to be more like tolerance . There were many warning in the film that he obviously . He also designed to protect him and ultimately the price . I do not feel sorry for Timothy , he was a nut case and spread misinformation about these . However , it is worth seeing some incredible footage of the , , and other wildlife that Timothy shoot .",1

Not much of a plot to speak of and only one or two genuine , this is an overall failure .  s death  t even worth watching as it  s highly unrealistic .

"Truly one of the least intelligent I have had the misery of actually sitting through . The humor was primarily vulgar , rarely funny , unintelligent and not incredibly subtle as some might suggest . If only I could have known , now I don  t get back that hour and a half of my life . I do find it an impressive achievement that they did not rely on to add to the content of the movie . Unfortunately , that does not excuse the lack of creative thought and attention to what an audience may actually desire ; a comedy . To subject them to a puppet drama with limited scope of thought to be a bit of a travesty . However , I am sure that loyal of South Park this movie as creative genius and for that I say , Trey Parker can laugh all the way to the bank .",0
"As a big Clive fan , I was greatly looking forward to seeing this film - especially in the light of how badly  Raise The Titanic  in its film version .   was full of promise . Unfortunately , the film - have everything that was great about the book , and we  re left with another run - of - the - mill adventure film . Where was the epic trek across the desert , full of hardship and thirst ? That is * the * essence of the book : how Dirk and Al one of nature  s . The film their journey seem like a stroll along a beach , albeit with a large sand dune or two . Where was the plot about and keeping in inhuman and them as slave labour ? The film one scene that us some of  s enemy had been . Sorry , but that  s not the same . The reason the bad are SO evil in the book is because the book you what they  re capable of . The film merely them as a kindergarten criminal and dictator . Where was the climax , where got his comeuppance ? The ending of the film is tame to say the least . The biggest disappointment , however , was that none of the major were remotely like  s original . in the film is a surfer dude ;  s original character a lot more depth and sophistication . is supposed to be a stocky , curly - haired with a deadpan sense of humour . None of these are present in the film ! is supposed to play .  s would never have accepted being brushed off by the government official as he was in the film . Is it right for me to judge the film based upon my from Clive  s and his novel ? Yes , I think this is perfectly fair . It  s supposed to be a film based upon the book . While I accept that a regular - length film will never be able to contain all the plot and depth of a thick novel , it should at least take a stab at all the most important . All of these are missing in the film . A word of advice to those of Clive : don  t expect too much .",0
"There is very little story here . You have probably seen all the interesting footage on the . Most of the footage is from footage actually shot by himself saying the same thing over and over about the . The footage which is left is not interesting and the are basically boring .

He was living with them , talking to them and felt that they were his   who for him and him . Eventually he and his were and eaten by one of his  , a grizzly bear . End of story . No surprise .",0
"Every comment on the nude scene simply it is gratuitous . Just because so many do have gratuitous nude is no reason to gratuitously label all nude as gratuitous . In this case , it is necessary . You are at the point where you are wondering whether you should be about whether this couple should live or die , and whether they are just or fragile , sensitive , and , yes , beautiful human . This scene you over that edge . From that point forward you can really identify with and care about the because you have seen them at a vulnerable but plausible moment , where their guard was down . Does everyone sleep and read naked ? Maybe not , but they should ( I do )! The rest of the moment really well off the initial . It , as in my case , not to know the outcome . The only implausible part , which I have to say was forgivable , is that in reality within 2 - 3 of they were they would have panicked like crazy and they were almost certainly going to die .

"While any naturally a subject with his own , documentary are often most effective when the for impartiality .

"Alone in The Dark is one of my favorite role - - of all time . I remember spending whole nights facing the screen , trying to escape that mansion and actually being at times when came surprisingly charging in . Now , mind you - I am weary of  computer - game -  . I don  t remember a single success story in this new genre , although some are entertaining enough to be watchable . And yet , I am such a big fan of the game that I  t resist . My rationale was that if the movie had a plot that so much as the game  s , it would be . Man , those were 90 ( which like 300 ) of my life that I  never get back . If I had that chance , I would have gladly spent them my sock drawer instead . This  t even in the  so bad it  s funny  category . You would think even Slater had a bit more sense than joining this stink bomb . Now , Tara ... I  m not about her presence . However , if the purpose of this chick in a starring role is to have a sex scene , - which I totally understand and support ( hey , I  m a guy !) - I  seen more of her body on press . There is no plot to speak of . Won  t waste your time pitching it to you . The credibility of the story below  I did not have sex with . . The acting is but a few above  Street Fighter , which , by the way , being one of the worst I  seen , I would recommend OVER this one . , I recommend the Video Game .

"Tried to watch The Constant Gardener in a preview show tonight . I say try , because the camera work was so jumpy . Even in a scene in an apartment with two people talking to each other , the focus went in and out and you got distracted by watching the door - frame go from the top of the screen to six or seven below . As if this was not enough , it then to go from side to side . The scene of the train sped from station , to bridge , to tunnel , to trestle , to bridge to trestle , to tunnel , enough to make my cast - iron stomach do flip . Add this to the that kept with no rhyme or reason or explanation . It could have been a great movie . somewhere in the middle of all this around is a great story . What a shame it was so poorly produced .",0
"I was lucky enough to see while in , the film festival . I  m really glad I did because as far as I know it  t gotten wide release yet which is a shame . I  d go see it again if it a theatrical release . Although the story is very  fight intense  the were rich and fully and made you care about whether they got hurt or won or loss . And although Wood was the lead and gave an outstanding performance , I think it was really  s performance that was the break out of the film . He WILL be a star if given the opportunity . Overall I  d have to say it was a great flick !",0
"I must say that few in today  s cinema world present the public with that can be admired , , and to the improvement of the real world . , what people count as admirable or praiseworthy are about as diverse as the in today  s cinema world ( I am often of the conversation between and in  Gladiator ), but I personally was with and by the character of in  Man . Before I go too much more into  s character , I want to comment that I myself am a boxing fan in some , but the concept of boxing , if seriously , me to conclude that making a sport out of two people one another with the purpose of causing enough damage to your opponent that he or she consciousness reason stare . But like in the movie , people die all the time but someone  s found a way to make money off of it in boxing . Apart from the boxing part of the story , of which there is surprisingly little in the first half of the movie , I found the story of survival without moral compromise to be almost without equal in the film world today . Additionally , the fact that this is based on a true story  s character and the story of  Man  even more noteworthy . I watched with considerable discomfort and pain the suffering of that little family in the of the great depression . My emotional commitment was even greater as I watched  s optimism , self - sacrifice , and nobility to their . I was as I watched him overcome each trial with humble , dignified determination . For me his character was polished with every challenge he faced and , shining and as the film . I this film because of .  s talent is remarkable , but I have found myself more by the boxing in other . But what this film is a truly heroic character whose story to involve boxing . Had been a basketball player or a , I think the story would have , in many , worked just as well . For me , this movie  t as much about boxing as  Million Dollar Baby  or  Rocky . In this movie you watch fight to survive outside of the ring more than you watch him fight inside the ring . But it  s the story of this man  s , and how relentless , , and overwhelming those are , watching this everyman fight after fight , integrity intact , that this movie great . is the kind of movie hero , and real world hero , that we need to see more of today . The quality of his character is of equal value , and I think greater need , today as it was in the 1930  s . What a remarkable story . What a remarkable man .",1
"I saw this at a mystery preview screening where I  t know what film was going to be shown . Sometimes these turn out to be real but thankfully that  t the case this time . Without revealing too much of the story , Wood  s character out of for a drug he  t commit . He to to visit his sister and quickly caught up in a small group of West Ham United supporting the Green Street Elite . The film does slightly the violence , but on a note . An engaging , good cinematography and decent cast make this a very enjoyable film . Two minor : 1 )  s  cor  nor  accent more to Dick van Dyke than  s East End . 2 ) To establish that Wood  s character landed in , we hear this frankly ridiculous message over the airport  s PA system -  this is a security announcement at airport . Presumably this was inserted for the hard of thinking . To all the who have that they  d avoid football as a result of this film , I point out that this film is fiction - not a documentary . are an absolutely tiny minority of the crowd at a football match and even then they invariably only fight among themselves rather than randomly innocent of the public ( something the film accurately ). All in all , an excellent film , worth going to see .",1
"A sequel to Raise the Titanic this was being billed as , excuse me while I have a quick belly laugh ! from one of Clive  s popular Dirk series of , this very much adaptation is glossy , well and very slick . Whilst most entertainment these days can be by leaving your brain at the door on the way in , for this , it would be wise not to bring you brain anywhere near the door in the first place as the plot leaves a lot to be desired with the size of battleship in it . The original plot line about the highly unlikely story ( or plot device , take your pick ) of the lost Civil War Ironclad battleship winding up on the wrong side of the Atlantic in the middle of a desert is seemingly forgotten for the middle two of the film until an urgent requirement for something with plating and a convenient working cannon turns up . Whilst there are good to be had and the casting of the criminally H as Admiral is spot on , there are other , not the least of which is the civil war in Mali that to be somewhat . More so as the supposed War Lord is as weak as a dishcloth and a very small army who surrender in a split second the moment the native turn up on horseback and en - masse . The biggest failing though is the of as Dirk . If is supposed to be a long experienced old sea dog then he should at least appear older , wiser and less barmy than this , more like Dirk was in the dreadful adaptation of Raise the Titanic twenty five or more . Overall , its watchable , the special effect are impressive but it is very silly . As this like the beginning of a franchise , I hope that they learn from the made here and consider recasting the role to someone more mature .",1

"I give this movie a full ten due to the hilarity of its commentary , not because of any quality in the film ( for there is none ).

So now we rent this guy  s stuff just to laugh our off with his idiotic . He actually that his are works of art !!

"The main reason i went to go see the movie was because of all the well known , so the fact that the movie was actually good really satisfied my night . In the first thirty or so , although nothing suspenseful , we do get a rather clear view of what the are like and several comical . When the movie eventually got going , i was clinging on to my seat , my face up at gory and yelling at the when they  t doing something that was blatantly the correct thing to do . Although i may have during some of the really bloody , i still watching them and thought that the effects and make - up were very well done , especially the special effects in the last scene . of the movie ,  House of 1000  in my head as i watched  The House of Wax , for the concept was fairly similar however  House of 1000  was more serious and shocking . This movie was also a hide and go seek movie . The always went and , the killer crept around and then BOO ! He / she them and them for a bit until the victim again , waiting for the killer to find him / her . This can sometimes get irritating . I the fact that when a main character acknowledged the death of another , they strongly to it and did not just forget about it in the next two of the movie unlike some other horror . All in all the movie squirmy , jumpy , funny , scary and suspenseful topped with good acting , make - up and special effects that made it worth while to watch , for me at least .",1

Without giving too much away , there is a fight scene near the end that is set to a kind of sub - in Arms folk song and in slow motion .

"This movie is rated R for graphic crude and sexual humor , violent , and strong language \u0096 all . And this is no exaggeration . Team : World Police is a dirty , low , sick , and mostly unfunny movie that terrorism and the way today  s work . I  say right now that I the first part of the movie . I found it to be funny ( for the most part ) and nice . But the last bit of the movie is so disgusting and vulgar , that I tried to figure out what went wrong with Trey Parker and Stone  s brain . You might say that it is rather harsh of me to bring a movie  s rating down so far when it was the ending that really me . I believe a lot of the movie on how it . I  t much like War of the because I thought the ending was annoying , yet I give it a C + because it still had some good . This train wreck nothing strikingly memorable , unless you count Kim  s solo , I  m So . I did find the whole  is with itself  theme funny . Team is an independent organization that terrorism . In the movie  s opening sequence , they destroy about half of in an attempt to catch four ; in another sequence , they manage to destroy the and the Sphinx . The main character is , a Broadway actor who in the play Lease and to have the ability to reduce to . Team  s leader , , to disguise himself as a terrorist and infiltrate their in .

I  heartily it , it a very straight point of view of our odds . no way out from pessimism and reality to be the worst of all your .. cool ! i can say it  s a masterpiece of underground culture . after all the watching now comes something serious about alienation . i  really the parallelism between f ** king - brains television and . maybe the director  s message could be a bit more widespread if the film was less brutal , but that  s the film ! if it  t so shaped it  t be so damn cool ! Enjoy it !",1

They wade in the water and do nothing . yes and attack them . And the chick herself at the end and her husband get eaten .

"You thought it  t get worst than , then they went and made xXx2 . Originally off as an take on Bond , it was watchable but completely the point . xXx2 the lead from Diesel to Cube with even more attitude . It does not work on some many , the story is awful and so far fetched , the action rely heavily on , so much so by the end that it the appeal . If you like unbelievable , story and ex from the hood that can shoot better the military then you might be able to find something to enjoy . I hear that xXx3 is in the making , when will these people learn , they take good ( L , ) and make them perform such a cheesy story . Maybe watch it once to see how bad it is but you will not be and will want a refund for your time and money spent",1
"of sewage like this bob up to the surface of movie - making , and there won  t BE a movie - making industry left . I had really high for this : fantastic leading lady ( previously proved to be chameleon - like ) and superb basic premise ( trapped in the Underground after with something creepy ). What I got was a film that me to suspend disbelief too many times , a plot with more than .  s panty hose , and at least one set piece which absolutely no purpose other than to shove the entire audience across that fine line between nasty suspenseful horror and pointless , sick shock tactics ( yeah , let  s have the  creature  shove a huge serrated blade inside a captive woman  s genitals ...). is no stranger to bloody horror ( , 2 ) but here she is simply to run around screaming whilst occasionally of total banality . A criminally wasted opportunity all round , and Smith should be actively from making any more ( just don  t give him the money !) until he  s learned how to a ) write an intelligent script that sense , and b ) how to create with REAL tension . AVOID !",1
"this movie was the best movie I  ever seen . It my attention . There was action , there was adventure , there were speedy , there were and . I thought it was grand . They for treasure while saving ladies , and also ended up doing a good turn for their country . When they did this , they also did a not - so - good turn for the bad . All in all , this movie was . Maybe not as good as some other I  seen , but what can you ask for in this day in age ? Certainly not the sort of wonderful , acting , scenery , artistic awareness , . of the of yore , but this is definitely something you could waste $ 10 or more on . if you have a date or not .",1
"I really recommend this movie to anyone . I think that and have a very realistic relationship that I could truly see one of my in a relationship like theirs . Like real love , they have their and , their awkward , and their little and all those little that make it a real and believable love and not just a movie love . It  s not your typical fantasy life is not really like a chick flick movie . It is a good mix between comedy and the tough stuff . to really love and you can really tell that they are good for each other and compliment each other . I  m a romantic and like the fantasy chick , but this one is probably one of my because the and are what love is really about and how it is to want to make that good first impression on your future in - . Mac a great dad and like a real father would when meeting his daughter  s for the first time . One of my favorite of his was when ,  You knew you were going to kick me out a week ago ? and ,  Boy , I knew I was going to kick you out 24 ago when the doctor it was a girl . That just like something a real father would say . So overall , I love this movie and recommend it to anyone . Don  t let the chick flick part turn you away , it  s more realistic than most . To me , this movie is not mainly about the race issue , or any other issue other than love and the love of two people wanting to spend the rest of their together and trying to work their two into one .",0
"Does anyone know the name of the book that the movie was based on ? I thought that at the end of the movie , when they were doing , it said the movie was based of The Life and Death of Rose . But i can  t find it anywhere . Does anyone know where I can get the book or the title or it ? I can  t find any on Rose and I would like to read up on her . Where anyone the story or not something happen to her . Be it a mental illness or and I would like to find out what it was . I don  t what anyone I was touched by her .

"It  s been a good long while since I saw a truly awful movie , but it turns out that I was due . There  s little I can add to the ( scathing ) criticism of this film that  s elsewhere . What I would say however , is that even if you can ignore  s distractingly bad accent , and EVEN if you can accept that is really a thug underneath it all , the fundamental problem with Green Street ( as it  s known under its release ) is that the script . Really . very badly . I mean seriously , did the character Peter actually say  we  re end it right now  at one point near the end ? The film like every bad from every bad  life on the streets  movie ever made been into a blender . And what was with the to the climactic fight scene ? I was it to break into In Arms . People have made with both The Football Factory and Fight Club . The former is a poor comparator - Football Factory had its but the portrayal it gave of the of the of the firm was far more convincing than the two - dimensional  thug by  characterization in Green Street . Ironically the comparison with Fight Club is better , if you can draw some kind of tenuous linkage between the of discovery of  and Wood  s . But don  t expect any of the invention , wit or intelligence of Fight Club here - you  d be better off just blowing .",0
"The Exorcism of Rose ... I bought a ticket for this movie to see a remake of  The Exorcist , but I was wrong . This should definitely be considered a horror movie , just not to a degree of  The Exorcist . This movie more on leaving a at the end . The question , does have epilepsy , or is she really possessed , goes through unanswered . There is virtually no suspense at all , something that me to give this movie an average score . Throughout the film , I could successfully predict what would happen , and that  t something good in a horror movie . I must admit though , there were a few that me to  jump  which , in my belief , was the goal . These range from subtle sound effects to cinematic visual effects . There is one scene in particular , in which we ( the audience ) see from  s perspective , and realize just how warped her mind become . The are , but not enough . The acting is good , especially from Carpenter , the woman Rose . She is screaming most of the time , but her facial expression can be clearly seen and understood . Overall , this is an above average horror film , but it is not one of the better of it  s genre . I was to rate lower , but this movie did make me think . The one question in the movie is never , leaving to fend for themselves . However , a thousand more come to mind as well . that  t meant to be . Life ... Death ... Purpose ... so many that need , and yet we have so little time to search ...",1
"I saw the movie , it amazing , and the of the main were amazing . But there were some also . For one , the were way . The only who were a part of the actual story were really Cloud , , , the , and Vincent . All the , , , Barret , Red , and Sith were mainly for . Square tried to portray a down - draught Cloud who he can  t fix , or save anyone , after the effects of , but it  t a very strong development at all , even when he somehow a bit of fighting confidence back later on in the movie when he off with Ultimate Weapon and and . the same girl who to talk some sense into Cloud from the game , so there was no development there . Because of this serious tone , the movie felt very short , despite the fact that it was a feature - length 90 . Should Square have worked on character development , it would have set a very nice pace for the movie , in lay with all the high - octane action . Another flaw , was that the illness ,  t very clearly . It to me that the illness at the health of those who carried it . Though Cloud carried it , it only to make his arm go crazy and give him . But that was it . This should have been fixed and defined clearly by Square . Another note to point out , just where did and his gang erect from ? Sure , they  re , but just exactly where did they come from ? That  t clearly defined either in the film . Also , people who have never ever the game before will never understand the - on happening in the movie . This film was clearly meant for of the game . Those who have never the game  t even touch it . If you  re watch it for the , then be my guest . The fight , though they a ton of punch in them , some of them were too in to actually what was happening . Were they or were they spinning in 720 x 2 ? It was hard to tell without wanting to pause to snapshot the frame . But those minor  t do much to take away from the excitement of the around and slicing everything up . This movie had many going for it . It was the most highly release for Square - , but it  t much what I , only because some to be worked on , and there could have been so much more added to it . It could easily have been a 3 - hour film that had good character development , great fight , fixed camera that made more sense than zoom - , and a clear explanation to why was such a dreadful disease , therefore a more directed purpose in the plot . However , despite all that , it was still a visual turkey feast for Final Fantasy and - alike .  t be disappointed that it this amazing and the action high in your . I would gladly buy it and add it to my collection .",1
"Yes I AM a FF7 fan , but how many people who watch this movie are NOT going to be ? And so , I  m this movie from a FF7 fan perspective , and with no regret . ( I would not know how to adequately review the movie for someone who not the FF7 game .) - 10 / 10 I . It  s a sensory delight - a complete audio - video overload . The were : some were accomplished that I would simply have not quite thought possible with an animated feature . When the action came about , they were , for lack of a more accurate word , a roller - coaster . With dramatic camera movement sweeping across from range to range , to seamlessly bullet - time effects at the crucial , to the sheer level of detail - it  s all hard to fault . The animation big budget , the style and imagery is awesome , and the effects at times made me forget that I was watching animation rather than live action footage . I could ramble on for myself on the fantastic quality of the , but it simply  t do it any justice . Sound - 10 / 10 The sound was fabulous . The for all the  t disappoint ( no one silly ) and the sound effects were bold and sharp . The music - from the game that ( in my opinion ) had the best game EVER , beautifully to the movie . Most of the memorable from the game are present in the movie , albeit often different to fit in better with what  s going on . There was some rock and slight thrash metal music over the really intense action from time to time , but it all fitted in well with the movie  s situation at the corresponding time . Story - 7 / 10 The story and would be the main of the movie . Both were simply not up to par with the game - but then again , the game could spend 40 + these - the movie only about 90 . As far as the story goes , the plot  t bad or anything , but just not as ambitious as was from someone who the game through . In effect , the plot rather weak in comparison . The game was so extravagant with the intricate plot and story progression / development , that the movie never really stood a chance to compete in the same league . Instead , the movie took the more sensible approach - to expand on the action and try to place as many inside - and into itself instead of trying to impossibly recreate the massive story factor , which was originally such a driving force in the game . The lack of usage also me some controversy - the story of the movie chose to use little ( though not ZERO ) , and instead lots of supernatural fighting ability and skill . I would hope that if a sequel was made it would incorporate much much more extravagantly and importantly into the film . There were also many plot in the movie - all which can be if you think of as a random anime , but seem ridiculous when you how it was based on a game that executed plot tremendously well . - 7 / 10 The , whilst all being present in one form or another , don  t necessarily shine to their true potential . There simply  t really enough movie - time to spend with all of them . And so , all of their background and are not entirely , and in some , barely at all ( Red and Sith leave absolutely no real lasting ). Even Cloud , who is the focal point of the movie , I feel  t use enough of his familiar from the game . The issue is a strong reason for this . With that said , it  s a joy to see the cast back in action , even if it  s in such a role that  t them to their . The new were the that me most of the strife however - the Bad Guy Trio and the dude - there was a huge lack of explanation about any of them . Anyone willing to use their imagination can probably fill in the with something reasonable and be done with it , but objectively speaking the issue is still there to be on and is therefore a little disappointing . Value - 10 / 10 The replay value for this movie is excellent - I personally want to watch it again in a more bigger and way - bigger screen , volume . Enjoyment - 10 / 10 Whatever the of the movie , they simply  t big enough to hinder my enjoyment of it , and I honestly think that will be the same case for most people . I tremendously , and encourage fellow FF7 to go see it .",1
"When Final Fantasy 7 on gaming - around the globe , causing panic since it from number three to seven magically , it took us all by storm for many . The depth in the story , the many branching side - and diverse not to mention a very cool battle - system . As soon as we had it once , we did it a second time and then patiently for a sequel of some sort . This review may contain so beware if you do not want to find out something now that you might want to see later . Now , that sequel finally in the form of , a huge project taking to finish , both and teasing . And the long work off very well , unless it  s a close - up on the face of people you don  t really know it  s computer , unfortunately it  s painfully clear when you  re up in their but we all knew what to expect . It becomes clear only a while into the movie that all the money was spent on the graphics rather than a decent script and better voice - . The story is torn and not complete at all , for those of us with a decent knowledge of FF7 nothing comes as a surprise and for those who haven  t even the game everything is a huge question mark . Of course , that only for half the movie since the last half  t really contain anything else but nice fighting - . Albeit the are incredible , they  re just too incredible . To lure in they quickly use some of the . Personally I was a Vincent - fan and a big admirer of  s rapid yet dirty mouth and it was a bit of a shame to find out they had taken a back row - seat to some of the lesser . Rude and are given a strong , comedian style which out a lot of and they  re really the highlight of the movie , their chemistry is well worked out and works very nicely on screen . Another trick they use making this movie is the music . Hearing the old could  been a nice memory but after hearing it over and over again , both and in the game , some might have gotten a bit tired of them , me for instance . for some new blood instead of dragging on something that should be left sleeping in its  glory they instead recycle the whole game ; , music and a similar plot . To me this is a movie that I will gladly watch again when I  m in the mood for something completely brainless and really fancy . For those who haven  t the game this is really just a long waste of time , the movie one and a half hour which is definitely more than enough to bore most . For those into deep story and well thought out , this is not your kind of movie as I think that throughout out those 90 , they talk perhaps ten in total . For you who have the game , knock yourselves out but don  t expect the depth from the game to come along . Shallow but pretty ... that  s how I  d summarize this movie extremely quickly .",1
"Well its finally here and the wait is over and I have to say I think the wait definitely been worth it . The film as already been stated leaves off pretty much where the game left us . The stunning and cool voice acting ( the version ) make this film an absolute must see . If you the game then I would be very if you  t like this film . The fight run at a terrific pace and the action is excellent as well . This film really is something that should be checked out by everyone even non - Final Fantasy fan although to fully appreciate the in - you really do have to have the . Quite simply this is what Final Fantasy : The Within should have been like . All in all this film is fantastic and I  m sure you won  t be left disappointed . Go out there and get it !!",1
"during the movie at one point in the courtroom . The attorney an argument about how   spoke in two simultaneously . He said that the human body two of vocal ( this is true ) and used them both to speak and at the same time . fine right ? WRONG !!! you might be able to make two different , but similar at the same time , however you only have one mouth and one tongue , you CANNOT ENUNCIATE both simultaneously !!! So , if this point was made in the actual case that the movie was based on , how come my point  t brought up ? I  m no doctor but thats just too obvious !!",1
"Square really landed this one . They  t try to please everyone and instead exclusively on Final Fantasy 7 . And boy , are those going to be happy when they see this movie ! The story might not be all that interesting or credible but it in neatly with the story of the game and several honest - to - god funny !! A total surprise there and a welcome one are lots of and funny to the game too . And most important of all : The fighting rock so hard they could cut through diamond ! They are truly the total awesomeness and would have made the movie worth it even if everything else . I mean , they are some of the best ever PERIOD . See this movie . Bye . : I know my review like the of a teenage girl . It was , like , totally what I intended .",1
"I shall begin with a disclaimer : This movie is NOT for anyone who lack interest or have never FF7 the game before watching . The movie on the audience  s knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot . And it does so very subtly . Do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of film and I promise it  be that much better . With that in mind , this film some of the most spectacular I have ever . The whole experience felt like an extra long sequence from the game , on . Yeah . The attention to detail in each scene , especially in the heavy action , is so impeccable it left me with a sense of awe . I believe the is simplified so as to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music . Again , for those who are familiar with the FF7 story and background , the music should not surprise anyone ( although the timing and placement of each from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply the animation ). Once again , I myself only through FF7 once , thoroughly this piece of art from Square . And that is the feel in most , and organized . Like a dance . In short , if you the music or the game Final Fantasy 7 , this film will blow you out of the water . If you  re in the unfortunate majority who not experienced the goodness known as FF7 on or , doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experience . Finally , I just want to make a note of the quality in animating this film . move with fluidity . Each scene background comes to life and its own story . For those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot , I urge you to the animation . Facial , subtle that bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery . Square and the great set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling . in a new era for , the that lie in each character to speak in and of themselves . Thanks Square . The wait was well worth it .",1
"First off , the trailer IS misleading . I originally found out about the before I went to go see it , so I knew ahead of time it would not be like the trailer intended it to be . In the end , I gave this movie a 5 out of 5 . If it were on a 10 - scale rating , it would be a little under a 9 , but I found it good enough to give it a 5 in the 5 - scale rating . : {{ Great story line .}} If you  re into the story of the movie , this is a good one to see . As long as you get into it , you  be able to immerse yourself into the movie experience and have a true feeling for the story . -- {{ Great acting .}} I found the performance of Carpenter ( Rose ) in the mind - to be an awesome addition to the film . It truly made me believe she was stuck in those w / o will . -- {{ True story to movie .}} If you read the true story , they made it a lot like the real - life story . From her seeing demonic to her eating and speaking in foreign , I found it quite life - like to the real - life story . : {{ Trailer misleading .}} Like stated before , the trailer is misleading . You  re to go and see a SCARY movie , but in the end you feel a bit disappointed because it  s more creepy than it is scary and , if anything , only you feel sleeping by yourself at night . -- {{ Lots of conversation .}} If you get easily of continuous talk and debate , this movie is probably not meant for you . This movie is more of a court discussion than anything else which will leave people less talk and more action / . -- {{ Ending kind of it .}} I  m not the only one on this , agree that the ending kind of left you saying ,  Huh ? That  s it ? You  re kind of left with a feeling of incompleteness with the movie because it in a  dull  manner . Throughout the entire movie you have a feeling of doubt and what  s going to happen next so you  re in suspense . Then the ending leaving you wanting more . ( If you see it , you  understand my point of view exactly .) In the end I still gave it a 5 out of 5 simply because I  m the type of movie critic that a great story and  t mind too much talk . But TRULY it  s all up to your final decision on whether you  like this movie or not . You  just have to watch it for yourself and decide . to all you movie - out there ! ;)",0
"I put in the title to deter those who haven  t watched the movie from reading this . That being said , there  s really not much to spoil . This movie is SO devoid of plot it  s rather sad , seeing as the original Final Fantasy that so many to flock to the genre of role had a rather good one . The movie character development , , and also is rather and predictable . However , I it . Final Fantasy : is a series of cool , with fight that make Agent Smith  s mouth gape in awe . The most beautiful in existence all this , by what may just be  s last real work for . The are , for the most part , voiced well , and , for what they are , they  re all rather enjoyable . So let  s go through the movie , and again , thar be : We get Cloud , which was pretty obvious to everyone . He  s got a motorcycle , a slight change in clothing , and a sword which he can attach all his different to . The thing about Cloud in this film is that , as a character , he a step back . He  s despondent , an enigma , and very much a in the first portion of Final Fantasy , and then he that he is not alone . Apparently the disease that Cloud amnesia , as he it all over again . We  re also early on to our main : , , and . and are , essentially , and rather unimportant aside from the fact that they have awesome fight ( and hey , like I said , aside from the awesome fight , there IS nothing important in this film ). is , apparently , a clone of . Or of . Or he  s been by the . To be honest , one of the main with this film  s lack of plot is the fact that we don  t get to care about these . When , we  re supposed to feel for him ... but where did he come from ? What  s his motivation ? He   ? That  s not enough . Give these an origin . This movie could  done with another hour of setup . Aside from that , they  re all three very - cutter . They kidnap some ( the of the variety ), one of whom Cloud and know ( but of course , he  s not really ), turn them into , and then them not . They also kidnap , who  s sole role in the movie is to care more about Cloud and than her  father , .  s our secondary main character . She as a major player in the beginning , taking on ( or perhaps it was ? Again , lack of character development ) by herself , and then she into the background with AVALANCHE . Yes , every member of AVALANCHE in some form , even my personal favorite , Sith . Aside from Vincent , however , they all seem to be pretty much . The sad part about this is that most of the won  t care . They  re here to see Cloud and and and , not and and . The team get in one good ( REALLY good ) fight scene , and then they  re to the background . We  re also to the , and Rude . Outside of the , they  re essentially the best part of the movie . Unlike Cloud , they have character , they have emotion .  s face to be the most animated face in the entire movie . They  re working for Rufus , who is inexplicably alive following his really amazing death in - game . Rufus  or are never really , making his return seem rather pointless , another loose end that will probably never be . In the end , Cloud everyone , becomes , and Cloud him . Then Cloud almost , but to him and he  t . Then everyone . The end . Predictable ? Totally . But man , them some pretty graphics , no ? To supplement my point , here are some of the in the film : - Cloud a limit break ( the super during the battle being my favorite ). being the only one other than Cloud to really land any good on . Rude  s glasses . Classic ! - Rufus  s fight scene . Perhaps the one part of the film that had me out of my seat .  s . The fight with . Pretty much any of the ( which was about 3 / 4 of the movie ). Like I said , it  s pretty , it  s fast - paced , and it is INCREDIBLY fun . It  s a really good movie . It  s just not great .",1
"Title : The Exorcism of Rose ( 2005 ) Director : : Carpenter , , Laura Review : It like its the 70s all over again . The 70s a time when religious horror every other day . That decade saw the birth of such as as The Exorcist , The Omen and Baby . But like many they into a series of bad horror that stopped being scary and turned funny instead . Now here comes the rebirth of the religiously horror movie in the form of The Exorcism of Rose and I say , I welcome the return of these with open arms . The story is based on the real life of a young German . A 19 year German girl who in 1976 during an exorcism by the Catholic Church . The movie around the defense , who to protect the of Father the catholic priest who was the exorcism and who is now blamed for  s death . The movie the leading to the exorcism in a series of that are shown whenever a new witness is brought to the stand . So in other , this is basically a courtroom movie with a horror twist . The interesting aspect of this film is the way the story is told . Right from the get go you know that in the exorcism which you thinking , well , I already know how the movie is going to end , the fun in that . Well the fun in this flick is not the what ... but the how . How the unfolded which lead to the horrible death that . So in spite of the fact that story is told through a series of , the movie to be extremely interesting and gripping . With every chilling more and more of the story is revealed right to its chilling conclusion . Now this movie  t as flashy as perhaps The Exorcist and let me explain why . We all know the exorcist is famous for its over the top head spinning , spider like crawling , vomit spewing , floating above the bed . And that movie is great for those us those , but with are a bit more real . Those of possessed are frightening in their own way , but its just not as special effects as perhaps The Exorcist was . And I think its because the were not blown out of proportion simply for making a gee special effects filled horror show . No , here the come simply because of the fact that these could have exactly as you see em on the screen . And believe me this movie to people , the audience I watched it with was on its and every moment of the way , the high of the in the audience let me know that . But don  t get the wrong idea , even though this movie  t heavy on the dazzle special effects , the exorcism / possession are something truly amazing , and terrifying . From horribly contorted to eating to speaking in unknown ... possession is something frightening in deed . As far as go this one is out standing , Carpenter to because of her grueling tortured performance of a girl tormented , either by her mental condition or the she possessed her . With out a doubt the performance that the most is hers . and Laura do their thing and its all good and great but Carpenter is the one who the show . The spooky factor is very high on this one . I  m guessing its because everyone can identify with these . Who  t think that their might be dark willing to screw with people , dark who might pull your bed at night or make your life a living hell . This is the main reason why this movie people at the edge of their . But for those of you who bend more to the scientific side of , don  t fret , this movie  t just show the supernatural side of . It also into the scientific and rational explanation of . This is a movie that will satisfy both the skeptic and the believer . There  s an ambiguity about the flick that just perfectly , if this movie had a religious denomination it would be agnostic , like its main character . And I must say I really that angle because in previous of this nature they make it seem as if everyone in the world is catholic and that their religious is the one an only true one . On this film its different because the main character is agnostic and even in one point of the film they bring an expert on and she goes on about how this sort of thing in different all around the world , not just with . So its a good thing that were aware of this and made its story more accessible to everyone even those who  t . In conclusion , a great movie thats sure to spook you with its religious and a great performance from Carpenter . A worthy addition into the  religious horror  shelf . Rating : 5 out of 5",0
"but the sad thing is ... not many will understand it . Being a sequel to the old Final Fantasy 7 game , the story is already set and as such those who don  t know anything about the game are likely to be more than confused . think of it as watching * Lord of the : The Two * without out the two . you  be missing half the fun because the movie a ton of to the game ... and that goes for , and . in fact the only new main in the movie are a new gang of , and Yahoo ... but even their part in the tale is if you don  t know the story well enough beforehand . with that said how was the movie u might ask ... one word : AWESOME . I  m to say that this lived up to ALL my . being a fan of the game did i expect a new revolutionary with an exceptional twist ? of course not . all i was to see my favorite in action on screen . And the way it and the action ... WOW . no wonder it took so damn long to make because the action are absolutely . blink for a second and you  re likely to miss out on whats happening . i think that around 70 - 75 % of the movie of action alone ranging from fist , chase on motorcycle , gun and sword swinging . so yeah , the total package is included . everything is detailed in this movie : hair and clothes sway in the wind , the numerous expression on the character  s ... everything ! before i come off as another let me address the i have with this movie and how many would think about this movie . character development : will definitely point out the lack of character development and the introduction of too many which seemingly serve no purpose whatsoever which only to the confusion ... but the only thing i can say to this is that these are all from the game and as such their have already been made and we already know each of their . definitely know who , vincent , , , and are while would describe them as * man with machine gun , red lion with his tail on fire * . a personal gripe i have with this movie is the lack of on screen time for many of my . i was when i saw all the familiar joining together evil ... only to realize after that scene was over we  t be watching them in action again which is really sad . story : first of all the story only like a setup for all the action . if i remember correctly the to emphasize the importance of but the more i watched the more the movie to drift away from that purpose even though the movie is . second of all , as said before , the story is very for those who haven  t the game . the result of this is that many people will consider the movie to be all and no substance whatsoever while they still forget that the story * already * been set . Think about this though ... WHY was the movie ? was it to draw in a new audience or was it to satisfy old , loyal who still consider the game to be one of the best  s ? the already knew the movie was be a hit ... the was already set and any who would be to the movie was probably just considered as a bonus . some might think of it as a cheap popcorn flick ... but like me will find a copy of this movie resting nicely besides my old , old copy of final Fantasy 7 for the PS1 . 8 / 10",0
"What is this film ? A drama or an documentary ? On the one side there is this documentary touch to it , by a constant wobble of the picture due to . On the other side , there  s this drama between two people that is completely unnecessary for the of the - scandal ( which is , to be honest , by far not the worst thing that is being done to these people by our industry ...) Too much drama ( a very unnecessary dramatic ending ), too little and I  t like the fact that the film with the death of the protagonist .

Add to this a detailed for each of the playable and even sub story  s for some of the lesser , what you got was a story of almost epic that almost 45 .

There are little  s to keep up - to date on whats going on but anyone who can sit and watch Evangelion or or any of the numerous anime  s on the market will have no trouble with this . In fact if you like bright , loud music and scrapping your not be disappointed . The is stunning to watch . In Spirit  s within * sigh * it was used to create a lifelike feel in all , here nothing is trying to prove itself , it  s so the character  s can move in a way that  t be possible in real life , that  s what its for and thats what it  s used for . The music also very special mention as this was always a big part of the original game . done an amazing job some , merely fleshing out and leaving some exactly as they were meant to be . Overall is for me a sigh of relief to see the Final Fantasy name on a film worthy of the title , and i recommend this movie to , Anime and when the (<-- insert your language here ) version is , everyone who a good action flick .",1

The problem is that Square - the and to bring everything to life , so much so that you find yourself looking at the instead of the whole picture . The biggest problem with this in the voice acting and facial . Square - come a long way since the original in , but they still have a long way to go with with voice acting . The voice acting is good , but it  t sync perfectly with the emotion of the , so it the a hollow feel . come out of the , but they don  t seem to come FROM the , and so it becomes very . In addition to that , many of the  seem unnatural and puppet - like , most notably the . It like great care was taken to animate Cloud , but they just off on minor to people who  t have enough time to do it properly , so you get a totally uneven feel . The other big problem is with direction . a game is different than a feature . In , you need to fill almost all silence with ambient music to keep the player from getting . without music tend to heighten the tone . In , too much music will drown out any tone set by the . Unfortunately , was directed from a gaming perspective , so the whole thing is almost completely saturated with music . In all , is an interesting piece of work .

"Green Street , as it was in the , or is a bad film . The story is full of fantastical and that anyone who in , been to a football match or the first thing about football will spot immediately . My first main gripe with is the poor casting of the two main . Don  t get me wrong , I like Wood and have a great respect for his work , but despite his best he to pull off this role . The main motivation for his character is anger at the system and anger at betrayal , however he much of the film placid and cheery , only his pent up aggression in one brief scene towards the end of the film . This linked with his and physique make him a thoroughly unconvincing addition to a gang of football . At no point during the film was I convinced that a ) he could handle himself in a fight against such and b ) the  firm  of would accept such a person into their fold . The other main character is by . the part , and is fairly convincing as a thug . Unfortunately , being a native of Upon in the North of , he the worst East accent since Dick Van Dyke tried to go cock - en - y in Marry . such as this probably will not bother an audience who will be less to regional dialect in the , but being from the it was a problem I  t ignore and it to the movie for me . The supporting cast all gave convincing and were well cast , especially the role of . The lad this character would have been much more to the main role that . With a film like this , you have to convince the audience that your are plausible , unfortunately , the casting . Imagine if you made a film like The Godfather and had ( Jack ) from Will and Grace  s part . You would not be convinced . The story in Hooligan is also full in . I am no football Hooligan , but I am a football fan . I know how a group of  regular  football can be , as such it deem it impossible for a non - football fan , who is not a fan of the club in question , is not from the area in question and not even of nationality to be by a  firm  who equate to a secret in some severe . My final , and biggest , problem with this film , is the way it football . I take objection to the film  s idea that despite being very violent , are as they live by some sort of code of ethics in their own world and should be admired for being brave and loyal to each other . This is complete rubbish . Football are complete scum . They take football , the national sport of and use it as an excuse to , frighten and intimidate people . They only represent a tiny percentage of football but give the whole game and people of this country a bad reputation . They are not brave or loyal , they are cowardly and evil . If the   in this film truly their club , West Ham , why would the devote their to being a stain on its name . are an embarrassment to football and to society . Football do for the reputation of football what did to the reputation of . Although this film / to show the  gritty  side of football violence . It does nothing more than promote it as some kind of excusable activity for extreme of the sport . It does not show the poor innocent by - at football who have their day ruined by some idiot throwing / / glass into the crowd . It does not show the innocent home and property who have to put up with and broken . It does not show the REAL of football who suffer indignity and embarrassment when their are from to away or abroad to because the among them ruin it for everyone . If you want to see a good film about football violence , watch the drama  The Firm .",1
"Now after watching The twice , the  t as shallow as majority it to be in my opinion . If you haven  t or it for whatever reason , this movie is most likely not for you .

Without actually spoiling the , I must admit that after seeing we have been together with my on our knowledge of . Seeing it second time to actually pay attention to the story more and most of the we may have had were . Some were not . is clearly for / and  t honestly try to be anything else . There is little to none realism in it outside world which the purpose . Music is mostly reconstructed with a touch ( team according to end ) and works well with the eye candy without .

There are two at hand in : and both were wrapped up very smoothly between the action . And trust me when I say there  s a lot of it . Action that is . I  m my vote from 9 to 10 after watching it the second time because I had a few explanatory I  t put together the first time that provided some . As a warning , it  s going to be easy to disregard the story and concentrate on graphics , but try not to judge the because of that . If you don  t let the story in , it  s no wonder it sloppy . I  m not going to praise the graphics because I assume we all know they are awesome , which might be an understatement . Especially talk so much more with their facial than ever before . I hope you pay attention to the for it actually sense and works well with the whole . Get ready for the ride of your life , there are no .",1

The story place two after the game and no short are given to refresh your memory ( though I doubt many would forget ), and goes right into the one hour and forty - one minute adventure . All your favorite are there , even Sith . The voice acting is superb in the version , every character is cast perfectly . Cloud tough and broody , kind yet strong ... is also perfect , she exactly as I . Sith less cute than I , but worked very well . The character are spectacular , great and lighting . The are and the are in a way to make The Matrix blush . The amazing camera work comes through in the bike , for example , where your are just screaming in satisfaction and your breathing heavily without consent . The music is typical quality , which its top notch . Familiar are remade to accompany  s graphical leap , which with the visual very well . There  s even an inside joke for the that music , it  make you smile for sure . I did not watch it with since I  m half - so I can  t say that the are any good . In , however , the dialogue is very good and every word like it  s coming from real living , not just . Impressive . I  watch this again someday with to see the since I  both the and release of Final Fantasy . If you are a fan of Final Fantasy , buy this movie the day it comes out or - order it . If you haven  t the game but want to see this movie very badly , don  t waste your time : buy the game , beat it , and then come back for this . I won  t tell you to not watch it , but play the game . It  make the experience a lot better and won  t leave you in the dust scratching your .

"It was painful to sit through because the commercial the film as scary . Anything remotely scary was so spread out through the movie it was impossible to create any tension or  spookiness .

I don  t remember seeing a single courtroom scene in the . It  s extremely disappointing when you go to a movie to be and then find out the movie is a courtroom drama !

"As the film , there  s that feeling running through your head that it  s not going to be as good as you , or hoped it would be .

The and fight are awe - inspiring , of course , and the character design is superb ... It  s not even the story really , that the side down . It  s the selection of what to involve and what not to , and the way its all together . The saga as a whole , through and film , is astounding . This film on its own like it  s trying to explain its self too much . It  s quick and flashy at the start , while a little disjointed in the middle . And yet , as the character of Cloud is so well and so much emotional baggage from the game , the whole human drama goes on . I  d gone from feeling iffy about the production straight into over as my own emotion took hold of the scenario . over , on the edge of my seat , I  t help but want to give this film a ten out of ten . And that feeling continued , through the end of the film . I was well and truly in . I  m not sure the film could carry itself , with the iffy feeling that over half of it , but for anyone who the game , this is going to be a fantastic watch .

"Even if you The Within , you might not like this one . I am a big Final Fantasy fan and apparently one of the minority who  : The Within  not only for its great look but for the quality voice acting , the intriguing ( although a little weird at times ) story , and the overall high production quality . It was a great popcorn movie . This movie , FF7 : , however is nothing like the older movie . is clumsy , a 5 minute story that 90 to execute , spotty that are great in one scene and terrible the next , and overall to impress . To be honest , I felt this movie was nothing but a Final Fantasy game  s numerous cut into one continuous video . The movie is almost entirely non - stop action but the viewer rarely any idea who is fighting whom because the virtual camera is literally flying 360 around the action at all time . It  s and just plain bad film - making . The film  s are almost always better looking than the . Barret and Cloud look great , and look horrible . Another disappointment is the story . took the most obvious , infantile approach to back all the major from the FF7 game and the movie us a token 2 - 3 with each of these just to make the happy . For those of us who Final Fantasy 7 , there is nothing new here to witness . No , no drama . The movie  s story is so simple it is as if Square - went to some fan site and a 12 year old Final Fantasy fan to write the script . But here is the worst thing about : it actually made me no longer wish for a Final Fantasy 7 sequel game . They  made all the boring , even Him ( you know whom I am talking about ), and I could care less if there is never another FF7 game . After watching this terrible movie , I think Square - are correct when they make new that have no to the previous .  s music is mostly just - up of his original score for the game . The new music he wrote for this movie actually better than the hokey guitar and piano driven he does of the older game music .",0

". Almost all of life  s and hinge on . If they  re met we go home happy . If they  re not met we go home . And if they  re then we go home , and breakfast just a little bit the next morning . If you  ever why so many people set their low , well , it  s so that they can  t help but be . What is failure other than to meet ? Anyway , all that is a long - winded way of saying that your enjoyment of The Exorcism of Rose will most likely correlate with your . I think the marketing department made a mistake in trying to push this as a horror movie . As much ( if not more ) time is spent in the courtroom as it is on Rose  s supposedly possessed and . If you  re and straight - up horror and then those will not be met . There are some creepy , but this really  t all that frightening . , don  t scare me that easily . Typically , a walk at night in downtown is to manage that . However , there was a guy behind me that  The Lord  s Prayer  at one point . I don  t know if this was an on his part and he was actually ( wuss ) or if he was just a moron who was trying to be cute . Either way , I never felt any sense of fear or dread . What I did feel was a genuine interest in the story and the courtroom . The movie is most effective when are telling Rose  s story . I especially how the movie both sides of the case . In one scene we  see from the point of view that is all demon - possessed and out like she  s Cruise in love , and then we  see the same scene from a medical / scientific viewpoint . But where the movie let me down was in the distortion of the real of the case . Yes , as the prologue us , this is  based on a true story . Those should always have you reaching for your grain of salt ( a necessary item at most these days ). This should come as no surprise , but two worth of research that the case this is based on ( the girl  s real name was   not  Rose ) little resemblance to the overly dramatic portrayal that the movie us . I know it  s just a movie , but I  t help but be skeptical once everything to get a little too coincidental . Something to a key witness , Laura to see dark , we  re falsely informed that there was only one exorcism and it took place on , Laura to wake up every night at 3 : 00 AM . The priest the audience that this is significant because it  s known as  the demonic witching hour . It  s an inversion of 3 : 00 - one theoretical time of  s death . At this point I to think ,  Oh come on , now THAT can  t be part of the true story . My skepticism to become a distraction . Plus , it  t help that I had ,  And she baby , it  s 3 : 00 AM I must be lonely ! running through my head . Matchbox 20 always have a way of a mood . But that  s just a small complaint . I was disappointed when I got home , did some research , and found out that most of the movie  s regarding the possession and the priest  s were indeed fictional and had nothing to do with the real case . My were confirmed . I suppose you have to twist the and dramatize everything when you  re trying to scare people , but I was this would be a case where truth really was stranger than fiction . I convinced myself to expect that would * not * be the case , so my were met and I went home happy . I was just my brand cinnamon pop tart would taste the next morning . Oh well , maybe next time . THE GIST The Exorcism of Rose is an entertaining movie as long as you get what you  re . I recommend you go in a courtroom drama with horror and a fictional story with of truth and you should go home . After all , joy and disappointment hinge on , so sometimes it  s best to have a good idea of what to expect .",0

"Yesterday I was when I the release of the film with fan - made . Of course , this that the in the movie when it comes to the will be different , but the main plot and story are the same , so that is what I  m going with . Let me first say that I am a huge fan of Final Fantasy . It was the first role - game I ever and none to this date have come close to its  caliber . When I about the movie being made all in , I was slightly that it would turn out like : within , which although well , on a massive level because the did not seem like real people ( due to a large part on computer graphics that at the time were revolutionary , but fell short of grasping realism ).... Thankfully , this movie is everything that within  t . , inarguably , is visually the most stunning film ever made . The themselves are highly realistic , but at the same time are almost comic - book - esquire , which works because this is a film that is based off a video game . The facial and especially the mouth are unbelievable , which is why I encourage people to watch this instead of when it comes out so that they can see just how wonderful it . The take the cake as well with highly clothing , , , hair , , and as well as superb lighting and water interaction . In many ways , the almost tend to out - due their living ... That is until actually start fighting and then nothing is sacred . This movie is for two ; the graphics and the fight . Nothing like this ever been done before on this level . The may be realistic , but the action is beyond unreal ; I really think it its  own category past unreal . fight while and flying fifty in the air and land on their after falling a mile out of the sky . While in the air , they will fight about 10 off the ground for 10 before coming down . will around , while still going forward , and then spin back going the same speed that they were at . They spin and jump around with no regard to their environment and always seem to land on something instead of falling to their demise . This movie is chaos ; that is , it is absolutely nutty and near - impossible to keep up with , yet it a flow and grace about it like a symphonic masterpiece . See this movie and I guarantee that your definition of the word  intense  will change . The plot is the one area where the film slightly . The movie place two after the end of the game , where the world is now in poverty and is itself after tried to destroy the planet by Meteor to destroy it . A virus , , is many people , especially . is a reaction of the , the planet  s energy , trying to fight inside people  s . A group that they have a cure for the disease and trick the into helping them with their plan to resurrect and form another Reunion . Cloud and the gang , along with a few of , must stop them from another Reunion and save the world once again . It is never really who the of the are or how they have in them , nor why the have the in them . I really wish they had this better as it is key to the movie , but maybe they will address it in the Version . That , the remain very true to the game . Cloud is still internal with himself and is and him to not run away from his . The other main of the game are also in the movie ( Barret , Red , , Vincent , , Sith ) and also some other secondary that are a treat to see ( , Rude ). This movie is still a great movie to anyone who never the original game , but to those that have , it is truly special . Square payed very special attention to the movie and have included in it that die - hard will appreciate and praise . For those of us who have this long for a sequel , the movie is a god - send ... for those who just like , it  s a jaw - dropping spectacle .",1

"For a fan of FF7 , this movie will leave in ( or at least speechless ). If you  re a general movie / anime / action lover , it won  t do far from that . The graphics , first of all , are some of the best I  seen . The story is a little to some one who  t play FF7 , but they do a decent job of up the story at the start . The best part about this movie ? The fight . I can  t think of one , or a million to describe them . Just that you have to see them for yourself . The array of different , and different . Mixed with amazing graphics . If you blink , you could miss several turning in a fight . - I watched this movie again right after seeing and a lot more . Most important about this game , is that it 100 % tie to the FF7 , which will keep a lot of people happy , and show a whole new world . - A must see",1

It  t like your classic horror movie with special effects taking over and away from the story being told . and are spectacular in their , each a different side of religion . Even the prosecutor , by , us an interesting look on faith . us the extreme faith in God and that the supernatural are the for certain . is more of an middle man in that she that she no side to this but over time that this girl really had of the unknown .  s character us how a religious man only the and nothing but the . Three that everyone can put themselves into . The Exorcism of Rose is an intense dramatic thriller that will have you fighting back fear yet overcome with intrigue . Unlike The Exorcist ( 1973 ), this movie into the controversial with our society and it  s religious meaning . It  s not your average horror film ... that  s a good thing ...",0
"well ..... it tried to be a social commentary at some , but , its written so badly that I almost to kill myself , the acting is terrible at best and the plot so many that it might just be possible that there are more than plot . The lead is a pathetic mess , an arrogant high class who drunk and asleep in an underground station ... You begin to wonder why these employ . Where there should be horror there is a massive cringe factor . Where there should be genuine emotion there  s a telephone call for acting classes and where there  s a play button on your remote , there is also an eject button . save yourself the trouble of yourself  why ? how ? Did someone actually think this was going to work ? and just take the disc out , return it , get your money back , and buy , because that is 100 times more believable than this mess .",1
"The most insulting thing about this movie is that it to be a re - make of the 1967 classic  Guess Whose Coming to Dinner . That movie , starring the late Spencer in his last role , the late and dealt with the issue of race as real people would do . The original was made during a time of racial in this country .  s moving speech at the end of the original 1967 movie brought it all together for me . Mac and do not deal with race seriously . This movie is not about social justice like the original . The are not funny . Mac too grouchy and is not funny .  s and Mac  s wife do not seem like real people . This movie no soul and for a rental it was money poorly spent .",1
"As a Catholic Priest I was VERY interested in this movie ! I have never done an exorcism but I know several who have . There are lots of good & on real available today & I wish somebody would make a film which the successful outcome of most . The case of ( Rose ) in in 1976 is one of the in the past 2000 . In addition to severe medical & possibly being tormented by a dark spiritual force , the young girl also starved herself to death ... & her & 2 her to do so ! The film is really about 2 separate but related true : 1 )  s  possession  by a demon 2 )  s tragic death by self - starvation . The courtroom do a pretty good job of explaining the between medical / psychological & demonic possession . The film does NOT explain why  s & did not get her medical help as soon as she stopped eating . The film that this tragic neglect was part of the official Exorcism Rite of the Catholic Church . NO WAY ! When perform an exorcism ( a priest is NEVER to perform an exorcism alone ) there is usually a doctor or nurse present who the medical condition of the victim / patient . Some are even done in . someone to starve herself to death is NOT part of the Rite of Exorcism ! It is also an inhumane act of negligence ! For an accurate description & text of the Rite of Exorcism , - search  Rite of Exorcism  & read for yourself . The movie did make my heart beat a little faster for a few & it made me think ... two which make a good movie . But I hope people are intelligent enough to realize that most have a  happy ending  ... the case of Rose is a rare & very sad exception .",1
"Well , this is one of best of the genre , regardless of rating , of the past couple . Based on a true case that took place in the 70  s ( though many of the have been or ), it  s about a young lady who was either possessed by demonic or something along the of psychotic epilepsy . She eventually and the state the priest that the exorcism responsible . Enter the fairly compelling courtroom angle , which is really where most of this movie place , with ( from both of view ) of the that brought us to this point . This is the movie thats come out in quite some time . Despite the rating , the  thematic material  is very strong ( the unrated very little to it ). The of Rose ( brilliantly by Carpenter ... watch her when she  s talking to the priest after becoming stiff as a board and stood up !) being   and  possessed  is frightening stuff , sometimes subtle in nature ( her chilling contortion on the floor ) and sometimes not ( the whole , hectic , hellish barn scene ). Perhaps the best thing about all this is that for the most part , it fresh and not like it  s a retread of The Exorcist . Also , I must say that the sound effect work here is top - notch . horror director ( the : Inferno ) the film together rather well for all the back and forth , though I  t help but notice that feel throughout , what with certain , acting , and a number of  jump  ( though some were cool and  s decline effectively ). But if one can look past these , they will find a quality and dare I say , thought - provoking , piece of horror .",0
"************ Thought this was great , even got to see get it in the forehead . It was cool , I don  t know why its not higher rated . Great Originality and Pretty Damn Scary Too ! Lot of great acting especially for new . I thought did a pretty good job too , she actually like a real person and not one of the wax like she does in real life he - he The plot was original and had a lot of detail . I the way it all came together in the end , like when the were laying together being covered in wax , it was the same position they were in at birth . I  d give it a look . It the crap out of me and a few . I hate but I give her props for doing this movie , she should do a real movie with substance . See it :)",1
"As time goes on I  m getting less and less with horror . Don  t get me wrong I  m a huge fan of them . However , as of recent you haven  t had that have the caliber of like : The Thing , , The Massacre , Session 9 . It take the and make them into .  The Exorcism of Rose  is one of these awful . I had to an advanced screening two days before the film and saw it for free . Both I and my friend felt off after seeing the film . The courtroom trial is far fetched with the defense attorney scraping the bottom of the barrel for . On top of that the that revolve around Rose  s story are poorly . The whole theater was laughing at the end of the film . I gave it a two out of ten , because I felt the courtroom aspect was somewhat of an original concept .",0
"I must be the only person who the area intimately . Here in the , the movie is  Green Street  after the main road where West Ham United is and looking at the other it would seem that actually believe this drivel about . They should try walking down Green Street . They  be tripping up over the kebab and curry , and as for seeing any indigenous , forget it , they all out to ( the ) ago . The violence is over simplified and unreal and the are boring and one - dimensional . The ( Inter City Firm ) was broken up ago as was the violence and hooliganism that benighted football ( soccer to you ). Come on , violence like this was ago ! The problem is though , for some weird reason , the film industry this outdated and outmoded idea that is awash with football , , single and . Wrong ! It was also interesting to see take on a role outside of and for what it  s worth , he should go back to climbing Mount Doom .",0

"I have just been to see this film as I was by the range of I have on this . I have to say that I fall distinctly into the camp of thinking that this was absolute rubbish . The film with a load of standing on Bank platform and shouting abuse at a load of other on the opposite platform . The were dreadful as they were so clearly script written and not spontaneous . The lead character first in this interchange and we hear a accent that to be cockney , but up sounding like a cross between , and bad Yank . Very bizarre . Even more comical is the fact that one of these turns out to be an pilot . We see him a group of rival whilst wearing his uniform . I suppose this is to tell us that anyone can get involved in this type of violence but it is highly unbelievable . An educated man standing with a group of and beating people to within an inch of their life for fun ? Pull the other one ! Basically , I wish I  d not going . The acting was dreadful ( particularly wooden Wood ), the were thoroughly shallow , the dialogue must have been written by a panel as there  s no consistency and according to this film Bank tube station all of , particularly Kensington , Street Market and the .",1
"Team : World Police was one of the first I to see in 2004 , but never had the time to see it . So I finally rented it last night and watched it . The movie is hilarious on all . Trey Parker and Stone are excellent who are the behind South Park . There were a couple in the movie that made me die laughing such as the puppet sex scene , the ruler  s song  I am so lonely , the killing of the guild , and many . How the , , and was hilarious . Nearly the whole movie I . Overall , Team : World Police is an enjoyable satire that is highly entertaining . Trey Parker and Stone are good ! I highly recommend it .  s Outlook : 8 . 5 / 10 ***+ B +",1

"The reason I rented this movie from Blockbuster , was I to watch a  soft  romantic - comedy movie , and because I have similar experience where my Black is not properly accepted by my dad  s White family . In other , it  s racial theme , and how I with it , was what me to watch this movie . However , the  genre  of the film is a  comedy  and not a  drama , so if some sort of dramatic theme with a deep treatment on the subject , you will be very disappointed . As a romantic - comedy - it  s is whether it is  funny , and if it had any  magical  or  touching , what would seem  romantic . In of comedy I personally did not find the movie funny - it very predictable , and there were no surprise  s . However , there were black and the  obvious  hypocrisy of the Black family remotely amusing . In of the  romantic  it to be an inferior version of the  Meet the  series , only with a racial twist . It to be a money - maker ( or a B - type movie ). On a positive note , there was no real , violence , and nobody getting hurt of blown - up and no or sex . However , I usually take away if these are present as opposed to if they are absent . I do not recommend , this film unless you can borrow it for free at the library or watch it on .",1
"My and I just saw this at the in . WE IT ! It is one of the best we have seen in a very long time . E . W . an awkward fish out of water into a very violent , testosterone - filled brotherhood . It  s NOT FIGHT CLUB ! Whereas the story in that great film had people fighting in order to feel alive in a world they ; these fight for the sheer joy of the honor of their corner of the country that they love . W / O giving anything else away I  say it was exciting , touching and inspiring . Great all the way around . As for the with that we  been reading about ... It  t bother us .",0
"I was waiting 18 to see this , I read and then what I saw last night belief .  s accent is a disgrace . Why could not have cast an actor who is from is beyond me . As for the content , it is badly written , I don  t know any   who  t  up  with a blade and here we have everyone their , as well as a few , . The music over the climax film is a joke , do they expect it to be taken seriously ??? Avoid at all and use the \u00a3 5 or \u00a3 6 you would have wasted on this rubbish to buy  The Firm  or  Football Factory .",0
"Where to start ? , don  t compare this film to fight club for a start - ridiculous . If it was even a patch on fight club , the violence , blood , gore would be much more evident and realistic . Secondly , this film is no football factory - which is so much more real ( and Dyer look like an embarrassment ). Fair enough , the is quite decent and the fight are well - with a decent ending i might add . But the film on the whole is poor , seriously poor . As people have been the should not spoil a film - i disagree - either a simple casting error , or a lack of effort in coaching the the film to be irritating all the way through - it was obvious from scene one some / was the role . Don  t get me wrong , good looking guy , who great with a skin head - but no not a football hooligan . I could go on forever about how ridiculous the football scene was - the  fake steward  situation . Also , when the are going to play United up north , they go on the train only 3 of them -  t make any sense - this a real of and , which is in the film to be some mouse cult of about 5 people . In of accuracy - did West Ham and not play for the last couple of they have been in the Championship together ? , ten . And I  m sure  Bother  would be able to just waltz into a firm pub . Basically , a very poor film which people will like if they have little knowledge of real football , and hooliganism . If you do actually love football and are by the underworld of hooliganism ,, you will simply feel as though this film your intelligence . Ross",1
"I suppose I  t admit this , but after seeing the for  Guess Who  some ago , I figured it would just be very light entertainment with a lot of slapstick humor . I was mistaken . The director done a good job of a situation which  race , but gradually turns it into sharp focus on  what is love ? Mac is , New Jersey bank loan officer and loving but hard - nosed dad . He an artist daughter ( very pretty ) who is her home to meet her during their 25th anniversary re - dedication party . What she to tell them ahead of time ( I  t think it would make any difference !) is that he is Green , a very white Wall Street investor . The funny scene that is in the , where the cab up and automatically the black guy is the and the white guy is the cab driver . So , much of the movie is about trying to please , because he is mad about and , they are hesitant to announce , are to get married . But  t trust this white guy . . also a big secret , and he , because he quit his nice job right before they left for . We don  t find out why until near the end of the movie , but it was because  s boss had made a big deal of his being black , and quit in defense of  s honor . When eventually that out , he and everyone up happy . In between , with on the basement fold - out , to  protect  his daughter . There is a funny , but tense , scene over dinner where to repeat the ethnic he , and everyone until ...  What are three that a black man can  t get ?",0
"The film was , but some of the violence was over the top , and  s accent was atrocious ! Did they not have the cash to employ a voice coach , or an actual to play the role ? Wood is good though , his wide eyed naivety as the Yank new to football , or  soccer  as he it . The film how pointless the cycle of violence is , how it goes on and on without an end as each firm their own back for violence or by another team  s firm , then the opposition for that , . It how violence just in sadness and pain and nothing is really , and also the humanity behind those who could be seen as mere . Many of the get accidentally with terrible .",0
"This movie is burned down by the . I did not read a single positive one . I was lucky to see the movie on a festival , before the major release , before the could pie over it . The movie better . THe story is told in numerous . Its all about being locked up alone in an subway and encounter your worst nightmare . The film does its Job . Believe me , I do not feel the same in subway . The Creep character , which is more or less in the second part of the movie , is not psychologically worked out . You do not get to know his in any way . Besides thats it is a creep and 100 % mean and evil . This is one of major of the . I would like to say that it does not matter what his are . This movie will scare the living out of you . That  s what . This movie is not for the faint of hart - !",1
"Firstly , I have just found out that is not an an East accent , but a . Why a was not cast I will never know , but I do know that with him as the main character the whole film is let down . Don  t get me wrong , he is a good actor . But there is no conviction behind the acting when he  t know how to  speak proper  and  mate  way too much for a real . Not once does he say  ,  ,  ya know wot I mean  or any other slang common to any East lad . And frankly it like the film is trying to fool the audience . Give us some credit please . Just easy like make up are awful . On 3 at least Wood a harsh vertical cut dissected by 2 horizontal down his face from merely being once by an opposing fan . Now I  m no Firm member but I  been in and I know that the morning after you will get like you  t believe after some of the the go through . Little like the amount that they drink in the pub before the match are inaccurate . Proper / would have 3 at most : any more their  performance . I have this on great authority drunk with of the Hotspur firm ... The Army . However the most incorrect part of this film is the fact that a lad turned just turned 20 could run a Firm . In football you only get to the top through of fighting next to your fellow . Even the  Major  is mid 30  s at most , and neither are anywhere near as as the real thing . I went into this film with probably too high , seen the beautiful  Football Factory  a year back . However it let me down through it  s numerous and which simply  t make sense : A Head of a West Ham Firm would no sooner stab a Yank than look at him , let alone take him under his wing . The only saving grace I can see from this film is the fantastic performance of . He was the only member of the Firm and then superbly when drinking Vodka down by the nearly his old Boss . Put simply :  Green Street /  is let down by sloppy dialogue , due to lack of research , bad casting and , although it great potential , is let down by trying to be 2 at once : A moral film and a violent film at the same time . At least Football Factory knew what it was , and  t pander to the audience . trying to make a film .",0
"Why is this miserable hack to  direct ? He may well be the worst  director  in the history of film . At least Wood had a sense of humor about what he was doing ... Boll , God save us , actually to think he  s doing something serious . Alone in the Dark is the second of the Boll video - game - to - movie , and this installment he learned NOTHING from the utter failure of the first ( House of the Dead ). The plot are ludicrous ( the main villain could have ended the entire world some twenty before the movie even , but decided to indulge in an overly complicated plot ). The acting lame . The is , by God , outrageous . At one point our hero is through a generously proportioned mine , complete with , and out  I get a feeling we  re not the first people down here . Seriously . He actually it . Worst of all , this supposed  horror  film is not in the least scary . The are seen in badly - cut , and that only after some half of the movie is over . A climactic battle sequence is lit only sporadically , and we have no real sense of threat from the which are supposed to be menacing the world . Please , for the love of God , someone take away Boll  s access to a camera . Get a restraining order . He .",0
"with humour and suspense and I was all up for a brilliantly gory / suspense film . However what exactly was the plot ????? I am sorry if I seem a bit dense but 3 of us watched the film and non of us actually understood the whole reason for the existence of this movie . It was as gory but the worst part to me was the torn finger nail . I really enjoy a good horror film but I was left at the end totally perplexed . I hate these pretentious that actually don  t have a story line to them but are a pet project of a be director / producer . In future get an actual plot before trying to con the public out of their hard cash to watch a pile of garbage .",1
"The thing behind this movie is that it to be so gritty , it it self and up to disappointing and leaves one wishing death upon these people . Now , I know its typical of these directed by a guy  Rob Zombie  to be sadistic and shocking . But this movie is . I  t like it , nor do I recommend it . See it if you  seen every other movie in the world . Or if you  re a . I don  t think this movie is for a general audience , but for more sadistic . Saw was a sadistic movie , and it was GREAT . But this one is so hopelessly creepy ( not the good creepy ) its a hard pill to swallow while watching . It just you sick to your stomach you don  t like it . Some very gory were in the movie .... in the wrong way ! Raping , killing people , eating cocoa through a gimp mask ....",0
"I was quite looking forward to this film but frankly it all came down the moment the  Top Boy  his boat to provide simply the worst Cockney accent impersonation I have ever . Dick van Dyke , you are . Laughable  throughout the film were many , The  United  Firm standing outside a station ( which all like Piccadilly ) cheering the name of their team while they for the other firm to arrive from . As bloody if ... and ,  10 ago  The  Major  and his firm were a row with . Was it ever the fashion to wear ridiculous Bon in the process ? because perhaps the meant 30 !!! ... The Football Factory KIND of got it right , this one is just a parody of the subject matter , and is frankly awful , primarily spoiled by idiot casting of a actor who really should not have got past the first audition . Did anyone see the ( extremely brief ) cameo by Cass Pennant ?",0
"Being a football fan myself , I was naturally drawn to this story of hooliganism and its effects ... I it to be no more than mediocre . Quite frankly , however , it  s one of the top 10 best I have ever seen . There are some amazing , particularly from , and even Wood to the world that he  s more than just ,  . Some graphic and an emotional script , mixed in with a kind of gritty realism in every scene throughout the film it both highly and thought provoking . When I saw football factory , I thought it was a highly impressive film - in my opinion , this whoops the out of it . Impressive in both its genre and a field , Green Street is a must see .",0
"Now , most of you will probably look at me like I  m insane for rating this film , that the majority have abysmal , a 10 . But for myself , I think the quality of are mostly based on ( mine ) and that we let our own personal affect what we think and what we are to expect . First off , not every movie can be an art house / / thought provoker such as Sideways or Lost in Translation . This film to be what it is , entertaining and stylish and that it certainly is . I  start off by the camera work / style : It is outstanding and the cinematography is gorgeous . The film  t look much better if it tried . The atmosphere and lighting used for an outstanding surrounding that impressive on the camera and also for a very believable environment . certainly how to use the camera , that can  t really be . Plot is another issue . For those of you who were by the crawl text at the beginning must have lost your , because the you know and love as the Star have an even and longer crawl text at their but they all seem to be . Just a point ... but as for the actual plot of the film , it is rather good . It  t tell a story already told by the video , but rather ANOTHER adventure of , thus his story and also have some background on his character . The story around an ancient race , who mysteriously after opening a portal to the world of darkness . In the future , a government agency 713 would further investigate this , nocturnal , that destroy on command . are then experimented on and to be with the , only half of this is successful . later , is tracked down and because he a piece of the key that the portal to darkness . He the to kill him , with an old flame and old rival , and to find out the mystery behind his own past and connection with the demonic after him . Won  t spoil the rest , but the film is there and so is the plot ... I simply don  t understand how one could miss it ? Acting is decent , could  been better on all . Slater was good and alongside carried the film on their and put that were worthy of recognition . Will was good as the evil scientist and his role very well . Tara is my only complaint , she was horribly miscast and the fact that she  t act made worse , but she  t there to act , rather to be eye candy ... and she did that very well . She a high school drama student and a sub par one at that ... stick to Van Wilder . The action here is intense and amazing as well , there is one particular scene in  s apartment where the come and a  blackout  and indeed it is a cinematic beauty . The action and suspense are high and the excellent atmosphere , good acting , and interesting plot all bring this together in what I thought was a very under , and under - film . To say Wood made better is ludicrous and to say that this is the worst film ever made is also ignorant because if you look outside the box and try to think of this as entertainment rather than material , then you  enjoy more .",0
"Horrible , horrible movie . The plot is awful and no sense . Sketchy  t even begin to describe the lack of character development . There is no reason to get attached to any of the as there is no real substance to any of them , even Slater  s . This is all without even the acting . From the beginning when Tara forced out her first wooden , I knew I was in for quite a peach . If people can get in to write , direct and act in piles like this , I should change . If you ever have the choice between watching this movie at home on your couch and watching the couch , I  d recommend the latter .",0
